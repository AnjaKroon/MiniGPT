Why should the noble's word Be heeded more than ours, when it's our arms That till the land and bear the weight of Rome?

All: Aye, speak, speak.

Third Citizen: Is not the sweat we shed in peace as dear As blood in war? We break the stubborn earth, We sow, we tend, we harvest, and yet, when The spoils are shared, we're left with empty hands, The grain we grew a feast for others' mouths. Rome calls us her children, but treats us as her churls; Our toil feeds Rome, yet in her golden streets, We walk as ghosts, unseen, unheard, unfed.

All: True, true.

Third Citizen: Let us then demand our due, not as a plea, But as our right, born not of noble blood, But of the earth, the common soil of Rome, From which we sprung, and to which we'll return. If Rome is mother, let her feed all her brood, Not just the eagles. Let the sparrow, too, Find grain amidst
