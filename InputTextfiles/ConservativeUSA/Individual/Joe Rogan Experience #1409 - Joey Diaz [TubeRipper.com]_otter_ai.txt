I got picked to that fucking monkey. So this morning for breakfast. What's that? We'll send you those type of pictures anymore. But oh, that's the picture you sent me. Yeah, that that girl's lovely private parts. Oh, that's the best name for a vagina monkey.

I send them to everybody to presidents of corporations cops on Monday, happy Monday.

Everybody's days a lot better. started down the right foot, especially presidents of corporations, people that you imagine if you had to work in a fucking office for your whole life as old as we are. Now. If we were in an office since the time we were like 2324 years old, right at school, just every day buttoned down. Try not to say anything that's gonna get you in trouble. Just trying to fucking make it to five o'clock and then immediately go to a bar and talk shit with your friends. And then do it all over again on Monday.

I time it so I know you're in a meeting.

I know that you're in a meeting with eight white dudes are real serious about you know, numbers have to be up statistics. And I'll send you a phone rings. You can open it up. It's a picture of a woman's vagina. breaks up the whole morning like thank God Joey does exist because he understands what I'm going through.

That's tough. That's tough going to sales meetings. I used to go to sales meetings and they talk about dogs. Do you know what the Anthony Robbins things? Did you when I was a burglar? I want the Anthony Robbins to be a better burglar. No. And I ended up kidnapping a motherfucker. He said I walked on the coals. I was all in with Anthony Robbins. You do know this? Really? Because I worked for a Subaru dealership. So Subaru paid for you to go to Anthony Robbins seminars.

So they would give me like three bills for the day for per diem. I would go to Denver and do the Anthony Robbins seminar. You should be a Subaru spokesperson. Who's more loyal to Subaru than you. Nobody he fucking love Subarus love.

Love him. I just cannot. Because you lived in Boulder. I lived in Aspen. Yeah. And I saw vans. I saw every type of high level cause spinning around and you just lose control. And I did you ever lose control and Colorado? I didn't but I did a bunch of times. Yeah, it wasn't fun. It's not whenever you're driving in snow, it's touching go. You could get patches of ice. And then Colorado at night you got a thing called black ice. And, you know, I remember being I worked at the Crestwood. I was security and I had to pick people up at the airport at night. And I fucking did everything I could to get out of that job because when that I was in a van with people doing the speed limit, no alcohol, you know me I just hit black ice and the thing started spinning and you don't know where you're gonna land. But you have no idea I was with McGuire wire and I were on the way to the airport in Ohio and we crossed over a bridge and bridges where you get it because there's no ground underneath it so things freeze quicker. We went over this bridge just we just got lucky nothing happened. We both went all right. You know it stopped where we were facing the wrong way but there was no one on the road because it was early we're headed back to the airport. And we just got back in line and just like okay, I remember this I remember this like all sudden you got no power. You know I love German technology. I love the look of a lot of sport cars and everything like that. But when I there's been nights I've been I've 10 years ago I had a gig in Irvine. And it was raining one of those January in cotton California just coming down. I mean you couldn't see it in front of you and cause a bulldog and I'm doing 75 And why is it Subaru so good at that. Like what is the big deal about Subarus when I first started, which like I had never sold the car before I was a detailer. And I became a friend of the guy at Subaru. And he bust my balls every day. His name was Peter Pinto from Florida.

Little guy, he don't call Florida he went all the way up to Colorado to sell cars and he became mad I got I was properly introduced in those days. They gave you 1500 bucks the first month and they trained you for two weeks on cars. I knew nothing about the car. Like when you had that car in the in the actual fall off. You got rid of it because you're not a car guy. You're not gonna get up on Saturdays and go to the store and find the piece of 1966 converter. It just some people have that.

Tim Allen Jared Leto Gabriel, I love him for that. I don't have that gift. So when I was introduced to the super I'm like yeah, whatever. It's just another fucking car. And then I saw snowstorms. And I saw how people reacted to Subarus in Boulder it's either Subaru or fucking four runner. Yeah, that's it. That's it. So you know once the snow drops that September snowstorm it's super super was the first car that has an engine sideway

It's the engine isn't like usual cars. That was the secret about Subaru. The engine side it's it's, I've seen a few engines like that right? What do they call that in line?

Something like no in line is straight, right that's like a BMW, they have a word for it I have it's super technology started there. And then when I started selling the SuperS had a GL Titan I was really impressed with because what it let you do is, if you went up if you went up Lee Hill Road, okay, and you made the left to go down into your property.

And there was snow, you could press a button and the shock absorbers would fill up, and your car would rise above so you could go through the snow. So all those little things. The only night I had that way back then 1988 89 The GL 10s. The only knock Subaru had was that if you had a stick, you couldn't keep your hand out if you couldn't keep your hand on, right. So if I'm driving a stick, boom, I'm in two, two, and three, I got to kept my hand off it. I could only the clutch cable. That was the only knock they had. So the clutch cable would break. It would break if you kept your hand. I had one of those break on me once. Yeah, so you have to go one, then two, then three, then four. I had to actually break them twice. Once I got stuck in second gear and I managed to drive to a parking lot and get towed. That was in I had a 2005 or something like that 2004 2005 Porsche that just kept breaking.

The thing that kept breaking was that thing with the clutch and also the fuel pump. That was a GL 10 sedan I'm talking about the wagon to do to up wagon was just a brilliant automobile.

And then I started selling Toyota's those things are still on the road. They're still on the road, guys. And this is what I'm saying about the American dollar. I like the Subaru. Because I respect what they do with the American dollar. When do they give you a dollars worth for $1? All right, they really do for the American who's really looking for a fucking car to last I've gotten into Douglas Toyota, and have seen trucks with a half a million miles on it on a Toyota truck that says a lot. When you're an American, you're a construction guy, you know, you're putting in bids and bah bah, bah, do my fair to wind Smoking Tire. Do you know that to know that he's a big fan of yours. He loves comedy. He's he's got this great YouTube channel. It's all about cars. And they had a car a Lexus that they took to a million miles hit a million mile Lexus now who makes like set the end of the Toyota? What the fuck are we doing? That's what I'm saying. show when I had three Lexuses over the course of my life never had a single problem, zero problems. They just they just work didn't always work. They just work. All cars are so amazing. Now it's like the bar is set so high. That if you just get like us, like if you get a Mustang GT just a Mustang GT today, which is like, very reasonable. Like I think a Ford Mustang GT tell me how much one of those fucking things cost. But it's got performance that you couldn't even imagine 20 years ago, and it's probably under $50,000. It's probably 40 grand. How much of those

2626 26,000 Is that for the regular Mustang or the GT?

I typed in GT but it says regular. Okay, so that's the I think the regular one might have a six cylinder I'm not sure. I think they still do that. So I'm, I might be wrong about that premium fastback starts at 39. Okay, the, that's the one with the V eight, right? That's the coyote V eight. It's a five liter VA, fucking wicked powerful, like 460 horsepower. I mean, the power that you get with 40,040 $5,000 today, it's just insane. They keep getting better and better and better. It's like, where are they going to go with these? And the leases are great. Oh, yeah, the leases are great. Delete the deals that giving them and a buddy of mine just bought a car. He got a point and a half, whatever.

Interest rate, you know, four point, mediocre credit. It's a time to buy a car. Yeah, whatever the fuck you want. Cars are good. Now. That's the thing. It's like you can't make a shitty car anymore. Like America went through a time period. We just made dogshit cars. And everybody knew that they broke and everybody was like looking to buy American cars. You're gonna buy something that is gonna cost the same amount, but it's not going to last as long. And the Japanese just took the Germans they just took over. Then Lee Iacocca brought it back with the kei car. You know, it's the most hilarious country for cars. My people, the Italians, they never made a single car that's reliable. Remember, we had the conversation about my buddy who had the the Italian car he went and he went crazy. I'm gonna keep it in my roots. The car is still in his garage bro. Rusty, fucking the Bugatti or whatever the apparently the new ones you can drive like

A new one. They're actually reliable for two weeks. No, no, no, no. The new ones apparently, it's like everything else. They got to a point where they just had to have better electronics. Yes, I do. The triumph. We grew up on the Triumph the thing by Volkswagen. I don't remember that one thing by Volkswagen was a little van thing. It was a little van thing that that they're very there's like 10 left if you gotta think somebody will give you a million dollars really? They had a Subaru made a car called the job. That's it. Thing. Subaru made a call called the just the a three cylinder. Look at that just to beat just to compete with Hyundai when Hyundai came out with the mama bill and 87 Mahan they changed the game. And they came out with the estado whatever that little Ford dog car is 160 You don't want 50 down on 50 a month. Busted the car industry. Subaru. Pete everybody had to drop those tin cans just to compete those there was a lot of people driving those Hyundai's when they first came out. It was so cheap. A buddy of mine got 5150 A month. Yeah, all day long. A buddy of mine that I used to drive deliver papers with. And he was telling me he's like, look, look, these fucking Koreans man, when they get into something, they know what they're doing. Like if they're gonna jump into the car market that's a disciplined group of people. If they're gonna jump into the car market, they're gonna make a badass car. Well, listen, they're very reliable Mitsubishi for example, Mitsubishi. People hate Mitsubishi American why they hate Mitsubishi because Mitsubishi made the parts that were in the magnet that the Americans went up against them World War Two. Oh, really. So if you try to sell a fucking those, those guys are all gone. Knocking the rest in peace. But when you sold a car to a guy that did the reading on like there was certain Chrysler's that had Mitsubishi parts.

Ford had Mitsubishi parts on it because Mitsubishi is like the greatest biggest thing that car parts was so everybody has Mitsubishi parts on that car some belongs to Mitsubishi. So if you had a Mitsubishi you're a bad person. No no no no so when most some Americans old school veterans you know those guys that wear jackets with that with that when they come to see a car if you show them the Christ, a certain type of Christ, they go Nah, they got a Mitsubishi fucking 10 Watt tailpipe that makes sense because that's how pissed off they were about because the mags would shoot down an American to somebody with some I get a story thing. But then Mitsubishi got into business. Mitsubishi busted along and like the 80s late 80s They came out with that book and call the clips

remember the clips I remember that Yeah, little fucking car had a Mitsubishi at one point. I have a story on me that yeah, because they were cheap. You know, you go until you go into Toyota place to buy a toy that was your money. You didn't pay the bill speak to that Dodge used to sell their version of the story on it was the conquest. Dodge had the conquest TSI. And it was their version of the star and it was the same car it was one of the rare times in history where two car companies have the exact same car. The exact same car. One was the conquest what was the story on that? Was it Yes. Yay, that red one. Looks exactly like my buddy Jimmy did tell you Yeah, my buddy Jimmy had one exactly like that. When we were like 21 this is why it's very hard for a guy like me to fall for fat especially for cars. Because I've seen a lot of fat I've been Mizuki samurai how many motherfuckers killed this Zukie samurai was like the scooter you know these jerk boss at the school is today thinking that that go this is Sookie samurai came around and it started tipping over.

The thing started tipping over. But again, we tried to take quarters with a

sports theme weighed eight pounds. I had a friend tipping them over. They were made a fucking 10 And they want to be down you know 150 a month and for fucking an extra 25 hours that guy with a fan does he would die in these things. People would die and let the fuck yeah. They sell these in the Studio City. What is it? It's a electric car. That's like a one seater. It's got three wheel one seater Electra meccanica I don't know how to say it. I think that's it. Electric dad. It's crazy. And it's a one person car. Yeah, it's a

row, it doubles as a casket. That's what's great about that fucking car. Your family saves 10 G's by a casket. They just bury that fucking thing. But if you think about if you have to get around everywhere, it's just you most days and something like this is cheap. What is the difference between being in that and being in a big truck where all that fucking empty space you

walk in any fucking thing? You ever drive past one of these idiots and you had a light and you actually look at them.

and you're like you in his mind. He's thinking he's the coolest guy in the fucking world. That guy thinks he's fucking Ricky Gervais. That's actually a cool looking one. Look at that front squat hood scoop Joe That's a casket.

headlight? No, it's a hood scoop. Is that their high beams? I think it looks like headlights. But I think that's actually a real hood scoop for some strange plastic piece over. Yeah. What is that? It definitely is that clear plastic over? It's gonna be because it's inside, but I don't know. Crazy. That's like the RX 77 was a casket for two. Was it? Remember the Mazda?

Yeah, I fucking hated that cop. You know why? Because I was coming home on January 1. And I was one of the first people on the site.

And I was I don't know, I don't want to sad I was tripping on something. I was on some type of drug but I wasn't over the hill. I was still alert. And we were like, maybe the third car. And it was a Mazda that hit a pole. head on. And it was split down the middle all the way to the windshield and I get hit and girl yelling. Oh my god. And we were there. The fire department came ambulance, a couple heroes. him out. He was dead on arrival. They saw the car and that's why I don't like those little cars that gaskets. That stick gaskets. In those days and after that, I never gotten an RX seven my buddy that that was an RX seven. Were they the ones with the rotary engine?

I don't know as Mazda has. There's a sports car company that uniquely has a rotary engine. It's a different kind of engine. It's not like cylinders. Said it is Mazda? Yeah, they got a different kind of engine Jamaats is today. One of them. We've got more modern Mazda was in like 2000 Maybe? No, no, it was like 90s like before? Okay, it was before I moved to California. See, look at that thing. That's how the engine works.

Instead of having a bunch of pistons it's got this big fucking thing in the middle of it.

Like I wish I understood engines to know why this is that different. But appraisal engines have

real car people must be going crazy, right? I'm sorry.

I don't know shit. So we're watching this video that says Mazda RX seven rotary engine, how it works and it's describing

how it works is very strange video where you're watching this thing. rolling around inside of an oval looks like a big oval engine container. Very different.

But it's very fast. It was the one that this guy had I guess like I'm saying I'm think it's 93 or something like that. It was really fast. And it really handled really well too. But it was a very light car.

And these things are weird man. Like rotary engine. That's weird. Like how come nobody else adopted that just but looks like a badass watch. You know? See, I didn't have a car education. But by selling cars in Boulder I learned a lot now I forget that stuff. I'm not gonna lie to you because the the level of intelligence in Boulder from the university when they would come in the middle of Boulder let's at the end of the day University Colorado is where you go on to be an astronaut. You know, that is that was like that's that's heavy duty boulder that like a whole thing back there. So lets people move into town between them. And the Japanese that move there. They come to Subaru. And they ask very intelligent questions. Completely different than a guy like you, me or Jamie will ask the same with them. Yes, compared to what? Compared to what they that's what kind of questions, you know, velocity this that this and I'd have to find these answers for them.

Because they were like astronauts I'd have to go in, there was no computers and 80 Fucking eight like that I could go on. So I'd have to go on a brochure and really go into it. And then they take the calculator out those type of people. So that's why I remember learning as much as I could because it was so intelligent. When they'd come over, especially the Japanese guys. They couldn't speak their good English, but they would look at cars. What's this? What's the weight? That's what's really amazing if you stop and think about the creation of cars and how they've evolved and they keep getting better for a long time they did without the Internet. Long time some of the greatest cars ever created. Pre internet. You know, this, just think about all the various forms of sports cars and nine elevens all those different Corvettes that came out all that shit was before the internet. They were just looking at each other's pictures and looking at magazines and everyone's competing against

each other to have the best handling car the best looking car best fuel efficiency, things kept shifting over the years. Like for 10 years in America, they didn't make anything good. And for 10 years, what would he What were the what is the years from American Muscle cars when I say anything good I mean like something that like a muscle car lover other than the TransAm the trams ends with the exception to the rule TransAm they made some you know, those smoking the bandit cars so people to this day still want that was in the 70s. But from the 1960s Like, say 65 ish to like 70 America couldn't be touched. Those muscle cars are insane. They just kept pumping out cooler and cooler shapes. What did classic wing drive and what drove he drove in 1968 Fastback Mustang got a bad motherfucker Oh yeah, how bad a motherfucker. Well, it's a beautiful car. The design is the back end of a 68 Mustang is one of the most underrated forms in all of automotive design. That's a 68 Shelby, that's different that says GT 500 is a totally different shape. The Shelby had a completely different set of rear taillights. They altered Oh, quite a bit about the Shelby like the way it looks in the front end as well as regular 68 Mustang. It just has this beautiful like contoured rear end. Look at that. Look at that. That green card that is that's like a real modern looking like updated version of it real pretty, you know, with a phenomenal deep green paint job. But look how good that rear looks. That's what he drove. That's what he drove by the fucker. Look at that. That is Americana baby. Look at the tail end of that fucking vehicle man with the chrome and the chrome bumpers, and the red headlights and the black behind. Look at that fucking car, man. No seat belt. Will they had those ones around your waist to the back? waist? No, there's no seat belt about you bounced around like fucking rock back. How many? How many horsepower? Not that much. Not that much, man. A really powerful car back then had like 350 horsepower. Like, let's find out what was the 1968 GT 500 That was their most powerful one I want I'm gonna imagine this I'd like 400 horsepower.

Say 1968? Just Shelby GT. 500 horsepower. 1968 Shelby GT because that was their, what they would do they take it to Carroll Shelby. Cow, shall we take the regular Mustang? Just juice it the fuck up? More power better handling better looks.

Perfect. Yeah. Now who were they competing with? Like, what was? This is Ford. Right? Yeah, they were competing against the Camaro at this point. Because they made the car and the sort of the court that was like a little bit of a different category because it was a pure sports car where this car had back seats. So that's a 400 horsepower.

So to compare it to the Mustang of today, the regular GT forget about the new one. They have a new GT 500 that has like 760 horsepower. The new GT 500 goes zero to 60 in like three seconds. It's a monster. So are they making for that movie that just came out? That was Ford versus Ferrari. Oh, for the LeMans I don't know what it was for. I think it was Annabelle Reese. I didn't see what it was about. It was Shelby it was him making that car I think like they had Oh, really to make it or today's demand. Fucking I didn't. Well, probably for the movie. They got to stand up, right? I don't know. I told him. I thought they were race cars, though. I didn't think there were like these kinds of cars. There's like a GT car. Okay. I don't know, I guess is the GT 500. Maybe that's what it was for you. I think it's not even the GT 500 I think it's the GT 40 which is their race car. I think because I'm pretty sure I saw. I didn't see

myself. I think it's a different GT. I think it's their actual race car race car. But the new one this, Shelby has a new GT 500 For ridiculous car. It's faster around tracks than the new Corvette. They have a new Corvette this crazy, rear engined, mid engine, rather Corvette so newest Corvette, the best Corvette ever. And this GT 500 is even faster than that.

It's bonkers, right? GT 40. Yeah, it's a different kind of car. That's a car that's only for the racetrack. These guys have this beat. You could buy a Shelby GT 500 Today walk out of a dealer showroom. Hi. Hi. Do you know how to drive? Yes, sir. Here's my license. Like you don't have to hardly know shit. And they'll let you just drive home and one of the most preposterous automobiles ever offered to man. You can just go right into a Ford dealership. And if you have the I'm gonna say a Shelby GT $580,000 How much does that cost? But a brand new Shelby GT? 500 Wait, I gotta go pee pee already.

Okay,

How much would it cost? 72 Nine. That's crazy. 760 horsepower. So for 72 $73,000 You can buy a car that is so fast if you if you really can know that there's a difference between the speed of that and then the next car after that the next car that's more powerful. You really should be in jail. It's kind of cool. It has LCD Oh, it's dope is changing cluster for Yeah. Well, a lot of cars are doing that now because they can get so much more information in front of you instead of just a standard gauges. But do there's still something about them standard gauges either Mustang. electric car. Yes. Not bad. It's not bad at all. It's like a fat Mustang. Right? Yeah. It's interesting, right? They're using the Mustang name for other shit. Now. That's controversial. That could cause a problem. Why don't just come up with another name? That's not a Mustang. You know, that's not a Mustang. It's an SUV. Yeah. What about it makes it a Mustang if it's right. Why are you talking about doing that with Corvette to the Corvette could branch off and become a brand like Cadillac is you know, Cadillac is a brand. It's you know, it's synonymous with luxury. You think of Cadillacs, but it's a GM car. And if they decide to take the Corvette model and just make it a brand, and so have core dope SUVs like fast racy SUVs, fast racy four door sedans, whatever sells cars, man because did you see that Tesla is now valued at as much as GM and Ford together combined. Yeah. Oops, guys. Fucking dummies. He's a super genius. Just back off

it's hilarious, right? Yeah, so going up today, like, guy makes amazing cars. He makes amazing fucking cars. We're talking about Elon Musk Tesla's worth more today than what is it? What's the stock GM and Ford? It's like it's over 500 now but like the market value is there combined? Yeah. And everybody was saying it was gonna fall apart. I think it's a beautiful car guys, but I gotta give my time. Especially the self driving shit my buddy has

it's beautiful. He's got the electronic one.

Login. Which one? Oh, I don't know. Yeah, gorgeous. But he was telling me to go to San Diego stop in common city. Yep. and plug it in for 20 minutes and sit down like a bump on the blog. Yep, you do. You know there's just there's just so many different charging places. I took an Uber a couple of weeks ago I got in a car it was just amazing. That blew me away a fucking Honda Accord Hybrid so they're making everything a chord is that they make some nice accord now this car you get a Honda you get

Toyota some time that Toyota is much but Mitsubishi what's the other one? Hyundai when you close the door there's a lightness in the metal.

That's where you see the you know, there's a lightness like Julie closes a certain way when I get a new Porsche. I like clothes. That's that makes a certain noise you know it's noise we view you never been in my little tiny one. I got a 1993 964 it's a real light car but metal in it is so much thicker, thicker any metal

just stores like a chunk. When you close the door chunk. Like you could feel the weight to it you feel when you tap the fenders to there's no give. It's a different structure. Totally different. So I was blown away by the Honda Accord I bread you know what we're playing paying for gas. I mean, it's just a great little car. I'm looking at a couple of different options. I was in Huntington Beach and you're thinking about going away from Subaru. Adding something to my collection just because I need to get I gotta fucking I've always said you need a Cadillac. You should add a Cadillac. Badass, you should be a Cadillac gave me a ride. Last week I was in Huntington Beach and I took a special Uber spell. And it was that Cadillac and he told me exactly how he got it. What the scam is with them how to do it. He has he hasn't had a problem. The battery died and that's the that's their main night. The batteries die one day you wake up I gotta go to the commies.

I'll fucking choke you Joe Rogan. A joke. I get in my Subaru the battery's never dead. I wonder if they're more reliable now. I don't know anything about him. I've never owned one but I've rented a ton of luck and gorgeous. That's a gorgeous car. And when you said that, was that? It's Yes. That's the CTS CSV. Is that what road? Yes. That's a beautiful fucking car man. Look at that front end. The design is so it's so interesting. It's after I left here the last time or the last two times a guy reached out and said he would give me one. You need a Cadillac 560 a month to lease zero down on taking. Joey I want to see you strolling around in the Cadillac. I would love it bump and Biggie.

factor

in the Super I love that I have people like why are you driving a lesbian car

and it hurts my feelings like why are you driving a Lesbian? Lesbian cards or pocket Subaru you love a reliable car I respect that about you I want to get in the car and started I don't want to be in service. I don't think these things are unreliable anymore. No I got free service you know the warranties they gave me an hour fucking you know, Volkswagen which nobody buys what is that? That's a Cadillac.

CTS V look at that fucking car. Is that the coop? Is that a four door? It's hard to tell because the picture is so dark corridors. That's a four door. Oh, no, that's too that's too. Yeah, actually that little rear window. It's not like a full window. Wow, it's a beautiful car, man. They make some killer you know what's that killer fucking car right now if you want an SUV, Lincoln Navigator. The new one isn't saying I wonder what happened on Lincoln. I still in business. They only make the navigator and then they make one other one or two other luxury coupes, which are very nice, beautiful. Cars now are very nice. Gorgeous. Then they went away like they just Well, the

big old 10 million of those limo drivers. Then they stopped production on him. So I didn't know what was going on with Lincoln Continental. They just tapped out. You know what's the shit? Is those 1960 fives with the suicide doors. Come on, son. You know, I'm never that bold. I could not buy one of those cars. You got rolling around and one of those 1965 Lincoln Continentals with the suicide doors like holy green on a drive to drive a continental see what he drove Jamie

gray daughter used to get out and open the door sideways. whatever his name was the black beauty Chrysler imperial crown. Beautiful.

Let me see a picture of that. 1966 Chrysler Look at that thing.

We're looking at picture one ladies gentleman that looks like it as machine guns to poke out of the hood.

Well, that missiles that was the black beauty. Oh my god. That's hilarious. But I like I always like Wu Tang. That's the car. Yeah, the fucking car. Who's Who made that one? Now? That's a resto mod. Yeah, it was definitely a new one. The new one. That was the new one was Seth Rogen. Right? Yeah, I didn't see that one. No, I want to know the one with that one. We'll get that one. People don't understand. And we're a little too young for it. But people don't understand what an impact Bruce Lee had when he was doing The Green Hornet. When people saw him do martial arts moves the way he did on screen, like people wanted to. I mean, you have to think about how many people would watch a TV show back then. Like if you had a TV show, there's only like three different things to watch, right? Like if you had a TV show, you had the entire country watching one of three things. And if you had a big show it The Green Hornet was The Green Hornet and on Sunday nights, so it was it was like stealing. Yeah, everyone had you had you either had Lawrence Welk on fucking channel seven on ABC look at these things. Maybe

you didn't see this because that guy dropped and he just traumatized NBC NBC was traumatized only did six episodes. Look how bad their fucking fight scenes. These look at these white guys faking punches. Oh my god.

It's hilarious to see like old school bad TV like fight acting like well, you know, the punch didn't hit him and the hair goes flying.

It's so weird. Especially because we're not playing any of the volume. So we're just watching it. So when you watch with no volume, you get to really see how preposterous it is. How many how many TV shows that that guy do

know that Spanish dude did about 1000 episodes, different TV shows. From the late 60s All through the 70s who isn't? I don't know what he's the guy that was starring. right there right there. That guy.

character actors were like fucking so huge back then. But the Bruce Lee came on Sunday night I still remember driving back from Miami with my family and like being best because I missed Bruce Lee. They cancelled it. You didn't see nothing about Bruce Lee again, bro. How long was it between them the big movies? It was about a year and a half that kung fu movies were mainstream have five fingers at death came up? No the Yeah, five fingers that that there was all about the Iron Palm technique. That guy would look at you and this pond would turn pink

and that's

Tyler with that, and then Fist of Fury came out, but I'm not gonna lie the entire I went to see fist a few in the movie did I don't remember when Chinese connection came out that's what changed the ballgame. But see, it pisses me off today. You know when I see fucking people 20 years old talking about the impact of Bruce Lee or whatever. First off, let's get this straight. Bruce Lee was a tough guy, but he wasn't going to be Muhammad Ali. That was so silly. He wasn't going to be Muhammad Ali. He was, you know, whatever. Bruce Lee, Bruce Lee meant that the little guy had hope. Bruce Lee gave the Immigrant Hope. You know, that's what all these guys thought, well, Bruce Lee Falken. It changed. Everybody put a little bounce in the step. He chose martial arts change martial arts, but he gave you hope the movie theaters were packed. Martial arts schools were packed. Black people were going crazy because nobody suffered anymore. You see dolemite yet? No, no, no. Again, you know, you gotta watch these shifts if I'm gonna come on the show. When dolomite Did you see it? When he said What do you mean the new Where are you a more well, first of all a fucking my boy stole the show. Our boy the dudes where you will go to fucking MMA. A Western same so the fucking movie Okay, bad motherfucker. He's a bad motherfucker. bad motherfucker. You know, I'm sick and tired of these people going? Well, what happened to him? Nothing happened to him. Well, well. What happened to David tell David Tao is getting stronger every week. What you're looking at some fucking idiot jumping up and down on Netflix. David towel is getting stronger and stronger when you go see David. It's like people going crazy right now by the uncut gems.

Adam Sandler has been around for 30 years. He's got some for you as it may not be goofy jumping up and down and went near. But when he did have you seen him continue to hurt? It's great. Just go for him to cheer him on to go you know what? Thank God, because people think that will like fucking mooks his comics. I'll hate you from flopping 90 different directions. You could just ask bitch, we could do it all and when we get 30 years under our belt, we become weapons like Jimmy Smits like any of these people that have been doing it for 30 Plus fucking years. Eventually. You're gonna get fucking good at it. Yeah, so, you know, I still didn't see the Tarantino movie. I saw the Joker Tarantino movies. Amazing. I saw I won't say that. A disrespect for Bruce Lee. I saw the joke. I just don't even want to go there with no, I'm not gonna mourn. If he didn't fucking live through it. I don't want to hear his fucking take on it. It's it's not it doesn't make sense. It disrespected Shannon. So it means that disrespected me you in you disrespected my fucking Powell and now you know what I mean? No shatteringly? Yeah, but if a bunch of these people got fired up, I watched the Joker. I liked it. The Joker was intense. I liked the Joker was intense. I saw uncut gems. During the break. I went to Christmas night my fucking girls went to sleep. So I slid over to the lammle ate three edibles. And my heart was beating with that fuck because that movie's Joey Diaz. 83 to 84 whatever you want to do, we're gonna do what do you want to do with Joe Rogan? Listen, I gotta I got something coming next week. Let me get 20 G's done next week. There ain't no next week, Jamie Rogan and he tend to fucking put this number in, and it just goes through your life from there. You're borrowing from Peter to pay Paul. And then you tell him days who's to suck your dick. It's nonstop. I was.

People were like, don't get high and go say fuck you. I'm going to go see it. I prepared like, who's in it? Just a ham sandwich and a bunch of fucking whatever's it's just a movie of all the basketball player. That you don't know what a good Kevin Garnett? Okay. And it's it's nonstop so it's mostly Sandler. And it's

bumping into Oh, what happened to my 30 Wow, I'll catch you next week. I gotta go. Yeah, you motherfuck you know, it's fucking constant. It's you know that life and then it Trump is an Academy Award winner. I don't fucking know. You know, I took it home. I wore it for a couple of days. Okay. Is anything on the fuck Academy Award winner anymore? I lost the Irishman. You didn't see it yet either. So you go skiing for three hours. What are you doing these flights? You look at ENN which wait for him to go to sleep. You got to sleep your fuck you get that's when I watch these three hour movies. I can't watch them at home. I got a seven year old watch on flights. I watch flights I try to write. Sometimes I've come up with some of my best bits while writing No Yeah, no, that's after the movie, but it's a five hour one minute flight. That's true. So I usually do a little you know, I will listen to music. I get tuned up I eat whatever they give me. I fucking put the movie on and I got the notebook right on the iPad. So someone comes to me

You tighten it up. And then you got the whole night that night in your hotel room. But now I like the Irishman. Do you write on your iPad? Yeah, lately?

No screen or do you have one of those detachable keyboards, I have the keyboard with the screen and I just type like I'm usually so that's why I put the final product now. So now it's I have a notebook still, but I fuck around but different stupid ideas. And then once the joke works, I put on the iPad now now I could add tags to it.

Like I used to before so now you're just typing on the iPad screen just like a phone. Right? You don't have a keyboard. The keyboard. Oh, you have a separate

one with the big yes. Okay. It saved my life the best. When he was basically like a little laptop. Listen to me. No Twitter. No, Facebook.

No, not. Huh? I got YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, and that writing app.

That's it. That's my rest of the hotel room. That's good for your Friday night. Nobody follow you if you Facebook me out Friday night and I'm on the road. Yes. Like my sweater the same thing? I don't want to look at it on the road. That's a distraction. So on the road, I don't want to do podcasts. I don't want to do nothing. Yeah, I want to lift a little bit maybe go to a fucking local kickboxing school and do a workout. But I want to focus on that writing. Not six hours worth it. No fucking Hemingway, just to make little adjustments from the night before. Yeah, that's it. Well, you know, you got this time when you're on the road, and you can use it

in a way that's gonna help you it can be it can be beneficial. Or you could just use it. One or two things, right? You got to figure out like what's optimal for you when you're on the road. For me, I always have better sets when I work out. You have to work out always you have to work. I don't like that weird fog that I feel. I'm gonna fly in somewhere. And then I just like get ready for the show my cast fucking there's something about like, it's hard to get everything going. But if you just get on an elliptical machine for 20 minutes, listen to some good music and just say there's no option. You have to do this. Just fucking do this. Once 10 minutes gets go and then you're sweating, you're having a good time, then you're fine. For 40 minutes or more. We've been friends for 23 years, you've been taking me on the road for 20 of those years. We could not do what we're doing 20 years on the road today. Not because I'm not calling you out because you have children, you have a wife. You have 1000 other responsibilities. So Tuesdays, you can't do those shows on Sundays out two Sundays. So it's also it's like you you can get a lot out of that when you're in those early stages like we were when we were learning how to do the road. There's a lot you get out of those Wednesday through Sunday weekend's weeks. You know why? Because by Friday, you want to stab yourself in the throat. I'm saying the same joke. Yeah. So you wake up Saturday morning and you write like a motherfucker. Yeah. Because Saturday you got three shows when we went to the free show, up on Sunday, said to me when I'm doing Midnight's no more it's not worth it. Yeah, it's the law of diminishing returns. You didn't know a joke you fucking said by midnight. Yep. Even if you stayed solid, but you didn't smoke then we were sobers judges used to it like that. I fucking say this bit. So that's just a burden. That's a law of diminishing returns Sundays. People are tired. They don't they don't have the same reaction on Sunday. You and I wouldn't ever tie them. But there was no children involved. There was no serious girlfriends involved. There was no, the podcast wasn't involved. There was a lot of different things that now my schedule has to be this is um, I could talk and take the Friday flight to LA I can think the Friday six hour flight at 6am. Landon Kennedy had to and be at Town Hall ready to go at eight. Do I really want to do that. Do I need to do that? No. So I did this exam on Thursday. Get the New Yorker to take a little nap at four. Go downstairs do the elliptical, get to five pounds shadowbox for 10 minutes line on Belfield and shadowboxing breaks a tremendous sweat. Yeah, Papa jabs you go upstairs, so moving, you bang on out in the shower, open yourself up, and you Hey, you go for a nice steak. And you get to see the town. And then I do what I learned from my brother Joe Rogan. You leave a fucking huge tip. So when they go out for employee night, the word gets out the Joe Rogan in town Friday morning, you wake up the show so that I didn't have to go do a radio it was that. That's the splash. And then you get up Friday and you go to a local kickboxing school. How cool is that? Just and they're looking at you like Mr. Hogan, are you sure? Yeah. I'm doing the class. I want to meet a few people.

You get more out of that tonight and they talk to you. They bust your balls a little bit but then you get an Uber set to pick you up. And you go back to downtown. You actually got out and you was social before the show. I could go back to that hotel room and sit in there for six hours and they get your rightful

One you're drawing episodes of The Sopranos or handful one, you draw episode A sub mouse, then you go back to write, maybe you take a nap, take a nice 20 minute shower do a seven o'clock show, in case you sell out. You do the second show, but if not, you're back in your room at 1030

room service, you throw on a movie you haven't seen even edible, you're up at five you're at the airport at six. You're back at LAX at night. I want to see this documentary. Sounds perfect. That's that's what works for me now for me to be most effective. You know, I could be a golf ball and go out there on Wednesdays, but by Saturday, I'm not gonna be a good comic. Yeah, I think we still be a good comic putting the reps in putting in the reps in town is just about reps you know as many reps as you can get. The thing about the road when you're doing those Wednesday through Sundays is that you're getting long reps you get in like our sets every show, which is great too. I'm not I'm not I for me as

where we're at now. I want to give him 150% of his show last night I went to the Comedy Store I got to dig stockings right out of the way I mean I started the bag deck in the main room and then I took that same room and stuck them

but I wanted to try new material see I was failing in the past I was going all these other clubs and going let me let me not try shut the commies still listen, you bring everything to the Chaplet The Comedy Store and let the pieces fall where they made 15 to get it you do know that you see 22 comics and they're gonna see 22 comics that headline all over the world so suck my dick I'm gonna go 50% But I'm gonna go up there and try new shit last night I was talking about that we've always met at one time or another meet somebody. That's how you learn not to be a mentor. Is by me too. When somebody one time and then you go that wasn't right and then I'll never meet two again. For me it was a weird adjective. Oh, and I started out with it. I opened up with it to really put myself in the fucking hole of that

adverb. What does that mean to him? Is it a verb?

For me to somebody has been an adverb? Yeah, it's like yeah, the only way you learn how to me the only way you learn how to not be me too is by me telling you shoplift to candy when you were a kid right? Yeah. And your mother told you smacking she does that's not right. Same thing with me doing this LA is a fucking meat to was invented here. They fuck Marilyn Monroe to death. They fucked up that vaginal thing look like fucking, that fucking embassy in Tehran. Whatever. They bombed. What was that famous Fatty Arbuckle case? Where there was a that's just it's just disgusting people on it? Yes. Between the big brown documentary Did you see that one? I didn't see that filthy fucking animal. getting women to suck that fucking 90 degree weather. Six yoga session deck. That's just cruelty to animals. You could put you in jail for just sucking that. You know, a Harvey all that shit happens here. But as us as men, we've all me to somebody when you were a kid by mistake. For me. I was in love with this lady named fate. She was 37 I big juicy tickets. she'd wear hot pants. I was about 14 I had never even seen a vagina. No, Teddy's not done. And we used to play basketball and two dogs were blind. She had French poodles. And she had flip flops and she crossed the street. And she was so hot. She was 38 and she had a husband that was like 60 He would just barely be alive like that dude from Texas that was flushing Howard Marshall. He would watch her because he knew he was savage. We're gonna think that

she had two daughters and the daughters were badass and but one of my goombazz dated one of the daughters. I never told him I was I become I play basketball. Failed come on again. We just stop

and she turned for us and the sun would shine through a halt. Remember all the top seven these and she had a really yummy Teddy's with the nipple sticking out. And it drove me crazy. I was 1314 I lived through that I'd see are in the winter with pants on she looks delicious. And finally summer of fucking 79 I'm getting all fucked up with some friends of mine. We drink and fucking nips that we snorted some angel dust. And we'll listen to Led Zeppelin to if you're gonna fuck anybody. Led Zeppelin Tours The album to get your mind that starts off with a whole lot of love. That just gets your hips moving and then it goes into the lemon song. And he's talking about squeeze me baby to the juice runs down my leg. I'm like that's it that you're strong that my leg. My mother was a flower check. She had flowers everywhere. I put on like a shirt. I swear to God, it had to be bad because she would walk the dog at night but the husband

15 The dog would sleep that the husband would pass out by eight. So she would take the

Dogs Out for the 10 o'clock. The last she would put them down and you know, they were kind of blind French poodles. And she would still wear the fucking tighty whities. You know, the defense Dixie Deuce days

in the 70s before days even was invented. She already had the daisy with the shirt. And I remember being on that angel does hide in the weeds.

Like fuck with the flowers I had flowers for

I was gonna bring her flowers. But my plan was to attack a jumper in the thing. Throw it down and give her the flowers just how crazy you are gonna attacker like I couldn't take it normal. Like I wanted to marry her. Like that's how fucked up by anyone on Angel Dust. And I was on ANGEL. This was what I would teach the crystal Call it what you want. It's animal tranquilizer, no matter how you look at it. And I remember that I ran out mana and she turned and she goes, Coco what's going on? I go. And I just stopped and I go, Hey, I'm in love with you.

What are you talking about them? I fell in love with you for two years. I want to run off with you fuck my mother. I'm like, I just let's get a job. Let's let's leave Wow. And she's looking at me like like, like I was retarded. First of all, she's looking at me like this kid is Fucking snap. And she goes, you've been drinking and like I still love you take the flowers. And she goes, I tell you what if I divorced my husband, I'll consider it. And I was like, Okay, I gotta live with that kind of give you a kiss. And I kissed her on the cheek and I could feel the heat going on my head. And finally as I went to turn away I looked at her legs. Yeah, that juicy his legs in the world. I go Can I touch your thigh? And she goes Go ahead. Joe Rogan I'd like a kneecap and my deck just exploded sperm. I ran away like Steven Seagal obviously Steven Seagal run he runs like a flagger read that put that little limp It was these demons to go run there's a couple forgiven see him running runs very strange in what's very tall. What's the first one he did? That's really good. I love the law. Look at him. Look at how he runs. He runs like a fucking retard Look at him. Look at him. Can you imagine

he's just built odd. He just really tall he does run a little loose with the hands which is kind of confusing. Which one was this one this that's exactly that's above the law. I think it's cutting out cutting oh it's all a bunch of different movies now because now he's got more hair because people go for them because of the way he runs

yeah he was married to Kelly look Brock dog at one time. One time he was the man how many times I jerk off to Kelly love Brock and a woman in red. When Gene Wilder calls he this is what it is. His steps are too short. And his wrist flip around. Because he's used to do an aikido right he's used to like

going please don't protect them but I'm just saying that's what he was

known for. Like

those Japanese people were 3000 years to put Aikido on the map and now you're gonna set the back that poor Aikido school in Burbank has moved eight times they keep losing students it down to two students, wherever the schmuck and a fucking sword who's gonna go for Aikido less. Someone who doesn't really want to fight and you want to you want to be able to passively get someone away from you, which is not realistic. But the sword part the sword part could come up if shit hits the fan. If we go back and you know if we get knocked into the Stone Age, nuclear war with Russia away give me the see a beat now. Again, no dodge sticks. Yeah, they moved bourbon. And I've thought about when I was a kid I went to aikido for about two weeks. Probably fun. The guy's name was Richard bow. He was supposed to be a big time in Gothenburg, New Jersey. And he taught the flexion stuff but Steven Seagal and above the law took it to a different level that I'll bet on that throat slam. Oh yeah, he's got the deflection throat slam. That's fucking beautiful. I had a meeting with a guy in a in a movie. There's this like my agent sent me in to meet with this guy. They were looking for someone to do like a Steven Seagal type movie. They were looking to they were going to try to create an action star. And we actually had like an argument about this movie. That move right there. But the last one was his throat. That's what I got carried away.

That's what he just went over the

first movie and above the law.

And the one when he fucked up the Jamaicans Oh, yeah, which one was that with swords that sword fight and then hard to kill was when he that's the one that fits me. Because when you're in a coma for four years into these two days later, you're throwing psychic Yeah. And he's putting

himself

Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. I love

I love that

I love to do I love them too. I love the thing about him man is I think in that first movie, it was one of the more unique martial arts movies, like above the law, like it's almost a shame that he made a bunch of movies that weren't as good. Because if you go back to above the law, in terms of like martial arts history, and above the law is a legitimate historical movie in terms of martial arts movies, because it was the first movie where you got to see a real Aikido practitioner with a hybrid eyes system of martial arts. So he was doing Aikido but he was also throwing a lot of punches and knife hand strikes and a lot of strikes. It was as they showed the bigger feet and above the largest split, play this out. That's the bet Oh, y'all, this guy? Look at all the bullshit. I mean, I've made fun of the him as much as anybody. But listen, his Aikido skills, were very legit. He was very legit. Whether or not that stuff's real or not. That's a subject for debate whether or not it's really effective. When you look at other things like wrestling and jujitsu. Is it the most effective way to grow or Judo is the most effective way? No, it's not. But no one knew that back then. And he at the time in the 1980s, and 90s was a world class martial artist. He just had a style that ultimately didn't really prove to be the best style, but so did I. I was doing time. This is this is hard to kill a lot of people were doing kung fu a lot of people were doing things that they thought were legit, but they really wants the UFC came around. We found out oh, this is not the best way to do it. Now this is 87 That's a kid in this scene. That was just in the movie with Clint Eastwood the meal. He's been doing movies for fucking 30 years. I can't. Right now that do with the tattoos. How many fucking movies as he's been a bad guy right there. The second guy that got

every fucking bad guy every great. Who is he? What's his name? He used to live in Vegas. I heard he had some a restaurant in Vegas. I'm not even sure. I love a good shitty drama. A good shitty cop drama. Like I love I love like going back and watching some 1990s cop dramas. They're fun Kojak Kojak pop at the end how about Beretta Beretta

How about that fucking you know which one was good bro. That they gotta bring him back but wise guy. What was wise guy a good looking dude with the fucking he was undercover with the mafia but he really was a cop from the CIA like a Donnie Brasco type situation we could look and dude really a good look. And this is it right here. He fucked people up nice. Now this is a movie. Wise Guy was a TV series Robert. Robert wall Robert. good looking dude. He came he came out with Paul Newman in

Fort Apache the Bronx. Oh, why is God the TV series?

What am I looking at here? Jamie? Is that guy who? Remember that guy? Yeah, you remember that? Doc?

Who is that dude? Does it say

see go to just a regular search of it instead of watching the video of it. That's right. There are so many of the member wings. Wings for and jam Michael Vinson. Yeah. Was he? Sure that's a no no, no, no wings was the TV show. on NBC. Right? Yeah, Jen Michael Vincent wasn't in wings with jam Michael Vincent was in some show about fuck and more can wall Kadam Jan Michael Vinson was in some movie about a TV show about pilots in the air. That hunted you down on CBS. That's when he went fucking crazy. I totally went crazy. He went crazy like straight from the the mechanic like he went like, I think it was fame that probably did that guy in right famous. Alcoholism, the alcoholism. A lot of that was probably to do with thin air. Well, yeah.

Four Seasons.

That guy in the mechanic. If you go back to the original Charles Bronson version, the mechanic he was slated to be the next big superstar.

Right? He was he did a movie for Disney with Kurt Russell called the world's greatest athlete.

And right day fuck things up. He was he was a Disney guy first.

You don't remember the world's greatest athlete. He went to pick up the weights and his arm stretched him and fucking that was his first movie. It was a Disney movie and then

He went on to become Jan Mike when the mechanic

look. Yeah, look on dog who's handsome dog. He was the first Brad Pitt. He was look how gripped he is to he was the original. Look at this science fiction where he's outsprinting black guys is the science fiction movie. This is a science fiction. This is why he was the world's greatest that with beautiful hair. This white guy is outsprinting

everyone else looks like they're straight out of Jamaica right out of Jamaica tracking

this is a ridiculous film. Look how much further he is ahead of than those guys who you know would be him in a real race even the black people cheering for him. Even the brothers at chambers he did look fucking fantastic back then. Like look what kind of shape that guy was in look at the guy from good times. How would

this is a great movie. This is one of his first movies that blew him up. Then he got the mechanic and fucking that's how they kill him people today with the good times that the TV show member that fucking audition about 15 years ago the wonder the neighbor like Don't fucking loved you when I was a kid.

Oh, that's cool. She still look good.

She was the neighbor lady. Yes. Can you pull up the cast now? Good times.

Dude, this this show, JJ Walker. Still to this day is known for one thing dynamite if he won't sell unless you're given three grant.

clubs or give them 1500 A week and he's like, do you want me to stay dine them? Give me that like the the names of everybody.

Just go. Yeah, look at that. Fucking show. 1974 first episode. This was a show like every thought was interesting, right? Because there was a Jackson has quite a few. Even though there wasn't that many television shows. There was quite a few big name black shows Sanford and Son. Good times the Jeffersons like during that era, even though there weren't that many TV shows, there was quite as a basketball show. Oh, tremendous. Shadow. Tremendous. Yeah, forgot about that show. Tremendous. Yeah, dude. To this day Sanford and Sons one of the best sitcoms of all time. There's some fucking episodes of Sanford and Son that I'll listen to, or watch rather to this day, and I'll still laugh at Red Fox so fucking raw and I wish network television would look at that and go. It's time for us to take the sticks out of our heads again. They can. They're stuck. Well, somebody has to do it first. It's just gonna be their own demise. You know what, comedians, you're a comedian. I'm a comedian. I try real hard. This was our early education. This isn't a better education than watching and here we're watching. Remember watching Paul Mooney right these lines. Paul Mooney was one of the writers on this. So we had Richard Pryor on one hand, but then you had this sick fuck, he hated Puerto Ricans. I don't want no Puerto Ricans, my house. He hated Julio, the neighbor.

The neighbor, America. This was Friday night and then it was followed by Chico and the Man is you know Freddie Prince, CBS had their answer a fucking

Archie Bunker which will never happen again. Every year they tried to do in the different Archie Bunker and they were gonna do it because it's not coming from the heart. Yeah, they can't sell it like he did that. He does a scene when when he when Sammy Davis Jr. has to kiss him.

Like there's a scene of fucking when Sammy Davis what was the actor's name again Carol Carol O'Connor calm when Kylo coyote grabbed callow con and kissed him in the fucking lips. That you know

so many different Yeah, right here all this shit. You know what's crazy? Carol Connor was like a great actor and Actor for his whole life. But he's known for sure more than a thing for being Archie Bunker. Right here. Look at his face

yeah, like it was supposed to be funny that Archie Bunker was racist. And by the way, just for the record, everybody always thought he was a black Jew. You better throw Cuban in there to his mother was Cuban Sammy Davis Jr. Yeah, his mother was Cuban. I'm Afro Cuban. Now look at everyone laughing at him. Because Sammy Davis Jr. Kissed me freaked out. Look at everyone laughing at them.

You could like gay jokes.

Some black jokes, white jokes, Puerto Rican jokes. They talk shit about everybody on that show. You go back in TV now 10 years and you're gonna see the difference you go back and film. And there's some film that right off the start there offensive. Oh yeah today's world a very offensive I just saw something that was on like regular TV me and my wife would just wouldn't fly today. It was just something that was on like at nine o'clock and wouldn't fly. What about Ace Ventura pet detective, it was all about a guy who was trans. A guy who was pretend it was cross dressing at the very least, like pretending to be a girl. But it turns out to be a guy the whole time. And everyone's disgusted, because they kissed him thinking it was a girl. So everyone's throwing up and like, you would never be able to do that today. It would be transphobic people would freak out.

Do you remember that?

No. There's that pretty lady who was in a bunch of movies back then. But then just like went off the rails Sean young to remember her. She was in Blade Runner. She was the beautiful young robot and Blade Runner.

She was in a bunch of movies, man. But then she just went off the rails.

She she's one of those Gen Michael Vinson type characters for a bed I think? Well, just the pressure of it all was just too much. So this is the scene at the end of it. That Courtney Cox with the gun Yeah. And there's Sean Young, that's that lady. And so we find out in this scene that he's really, or she's really a guy, or I don't get it. Or she's, how do you say it today?

Batman even say it's a guy pretending to be a girl. But you don't say that anymore? No, no, you say what? She's trans. So but we're supposed to believe that. She's got a giant hog under there. Where's the scene? Yeah, he's got to lead up to he's explained to them. So he tells them all that that's a guy. So this is like some bad guy that they've been looking at. He's the famous kicker from Miami Dolphins. That's right. Oh, that's right. That's right. That's right. And he's angry because he fucked up. Yeah, all the cops know about this one game.

Yeah.

Here's the part. So she's supposed to have it tucked in right there. Right something and they'll flip around toe looks in there to Captain Winky. Now he's got he's gonna turn around so everybody can see that she's got a hog.

Turn around. Excuse me.

Really what happens here? Yeah, because it's the big reveal. There it is.

The more throw up

everyone's throwing up.

Tom log is cleaning his tiger up your dog.

One more day deck. So let me ask you a question a couple of weeks ago, Disney plus permit. Two days later people throwing fits?

What do you want them to do to go back and take all this shit out of his own movies? Well, that's a good question. What do you do you ever go to Disneyland? Yeah, that one ride. What is it? Splash Mountain? Yes. That Splash Mountain ride is based on a movie that you can't even watch anymore. Because it was a really racist movie. Well, Disney was racist was you know, I don't know. Disney. I don't know. I don't have time to flick this Splash Mountain. Was this is this is it's called The Song of the South. That was the movie. And then from what year is that? January

26 1946. People were different animals back dogs. Were not even the same species about the lady who sang the national anthem at the Yankees. Somebody found out that 30 years before that, you didn't know about that? No, you gotta look this up. She sang songs that were like totally racist like spooky get out of town. Like shit like this. Please look it up. Nationally right now. So a two ball fields. Took her version of the national anthem. Now.

You hadn't read the shit. She was here. Smith's God Bless America out at Yankee Stadium over racist sauce and

whose kids some fucking fat chick from 19/23 1931 song? Yeah, that's why darkies were born. Wait a minute. She sang this in 1931. Yeah. How will this just bitch.

She's still alive. It's like the recording of God Bless America from back then that they used to just play during the right she sang that. But when did she recorded 1937 But when did she sing the national anthem? No, no. It's the God Bless America is what they're talking about here.

Okay, well, when did she sing God bless America.

1929 I 1030 something on the back then. But she also song sang a song called that's why dark is a boy. I was confused. I was thinking you were saying that she sang it at the Lyric, someone she picked cotton. Someone had to pick the corn. Someone had this be a slave and somebody had this thing. That's why darkies were born. Oh, that, you know, I mean, all these things. You have a song, which has been called a satirical take on racism was a big hit for Smith, and also was recorded by Paul Robeson. Mm

hmm. So she wrote and sang God Bless America. So the version that you would hear like, ah, but she sang, so recorded it. So the version that you would hear would be back then. Right? So yeah, see, that's,

that's why she gets weird. You know, there's been a lot of great people over the years that have had some horrible ideas. They'll see you have to wonder like, like, if we just cut out the guy. I mean, how many people different people who have invented incredible things that we use all the time. We're also really shitty human beings. Like you know about that Fritz Hubbert guy, the guy that he created this ability to this method to extract nitrogen from the atmosphere and then use it as fertilizer. Because the air apparently you think of the air is oxygen. It's not most of what you're breathing in most of what our air is, is 80s I think it's like 80 something percent nitrogen. And so this guy figured out a way how to extract nitrogen from the air and because that population boomed because we had more food, because they could they could lay down more. More fertilizer. He did something good. Yeah. But He also invented new gas. He was the first guy to propose and implement a poison gas strategy against against Europe, when they were when the UK and when the whatever the whole group and guess it was World War one or two, they did that. Want to say it's too Right. Is it too?

Yeah, whatever war it was, then they were the first people to get so this guy who had created the harbor method for extracting nitrogen at the same time, was wanted for war crimes, because he figured out how to gas, the gas, the the enemy.

And he was working for the Nazis and he was a Jew, the whole thing is crazy. It gets even crazier. They eventually start imprisoning Jews and kick them out of the country. And he's still there. And so he eventually winds up leaving his tail is fucking crazy. But that guy also invented the same gas, they use the gas, the, the gas, the Jews in concentration camps. He invented it, but he invented it with a smell to it, so you could detect it. And they were gonna use it as like, I think it was a pesticide or something like that. You talked about monster? Yeah, I think the chemists John Lennon, he, he wrote Benny in the Jets, but he smoked Yoko, you know, a monster. But he's one of like that he said, 50% of the nitrogen in our bodies today from the harbor method. 50%. He so he invented something that was literally changed the way people can eat.

I mean, it probably saved billions of lives. I mean, I don't know. I mean, I'm just guessing. But I would imagine, one of the biggest problems that people had back then was when you couldn't grow things places when you didn't have enough food. I mean, it was a real touch and go situation before refrigeration. And then before, you know, large scale trucking and agriculture everywhere, like we have today, and how much of the nitrogen that we use came because this guy figured out otherwise, they would just use like dead fish and things like that the end of like, compost. That's what fertilizer was bones would grind up bones. But he's also a monster. Also, you know, they figured through his work, how to kill people with gas. They just gassed entire troops. fucking crazy shit, man when no one had never done that before. I mean, you got to think back then people would think about the, the the war, the Independence War, right? The war for independence against England when they would wear the British were those crazy outfits with the white right across their chest. They were perfect targets. So if you walk into the forest, and these hillbillies just pick them out, because they were walking like they're in some sort of old timey war. Like they used to do wars like they had rules for war. And there's rules for engagement. And then when a gentleman would lose, he would hand his sword over to the other men sometimes they wouldn't even take it because they're trying to be polite. And they would have these rules like gentleman rules for killing people. And then this guy came out with a method Hey, how about this, how we we just gas these motherfuckers just drop gas on them kill everybody. Just let them choke to death in their own blood. Literally your body just

vomiting blood. It's coming out of your eyeballs. Everyone around you is dying from the same

thing you just hemorrhaging, just dying. Because some genius scientist who also created a method to extract nitrogen out of the air that fed, millions of hungry people also figured out a way to do this.

Fucked up, fucked up. He just freaks me out. Yeah, well, sometimes

great people have done horrible, horrible things.

But that guy invented something that we all use. It's a, it's a tricky thing, me and a person. You know, people are slippery. There's a lot of good and bad about us.

Depends how you use it. Yes. Depends how you use it. Well, that's why being a comic is like one of the most fulfilling things of all time, because people get something out of it. Like they go to see you. Like, the reason why you're willing to eat deck is because you want to develop these bits and have them crush, get them to that point, where when people come to see and they pay money to see you, boom, you lay them on them. And they're like, ah, that feeling that you can do that you can give to somebody when you see someone just laughing so hard. It's one of the greatest feelings a person can ever experience. And not a lot of people get to experience and you imagine how important laughter is in your life.

A certain point, like it's your it's like, you know, you need sleep. Yeah, you need food, and if you really have

laughter, but you also have to learn how to laugh at yourself. Yes. And once you conquer that your life changes completely. Yeah, that's 50% You know, you know, the number one killer is stress. That's the number one thing that can kill you. Yeah. Is you being stressed out but humor? I mean, I love you and I at night doing edibles and finding stupid videos. Watching that whole stand up real? Yeah, just laughing my fucking ass off. I love it. I love it. I'm enjoying it more every day. And when you have kids, you really laugh at the shit they talk about it. You know? Did I laugh at kids movies? I watched Dora the Explorer. The live action one one the new one. It's hilarious. This summer. We're legit laughs in that movie. I got bad news. I got bad news for you people. The last couple of years I've gotten to see maybe seven or eight mainstream films. But I've probably seen 20 Kid films. Yeah. And I leave those films blown away. So you know what's fucking great? Jumanji? The new one. It's as good if not better than the first one. The first one was fucking great that those least you leave there feeling something? You know, like, some of these movies. I go watch. I'm like, What the fuck was that? She Manji hits a perfect balance between. It's like it's a family movie. But they don't treat you like you're a moron. It's fun. And it's it's, you know, they're trapped in a video game. So it doesn't have to make sense. It can it can be crazy. And so it is crazy. But it's a fucking great movie. It's a great movie. Both of them are great. They're fun. You leave you feel good. You laugh your ass off. And they ride the edge. Perfectly of it being enjoyable for all people but hilarious for kids. Kids think Jumanji is hilarious. So you can sit there and watch. You know, I took my nine year old the other day. We watched it for the second time. Just me and her laughing

That was so funny. It's the rock is great. Kevin Hart's great that chick who plays I don't want to spoil the learning that because she plays more than one role for some strange reason. I can't I don't have a spoiler, but she's fucking fantastic that the Asian lady that was in Crazy Rich Asians. What is her name? Aquafina. Yeah, how crazy is that name? She made that name up. She must have rappers too. She's a rapper. Yes. She was also no Yeah, really? Yeah. No. Well, that makes sense. I can't say without giving it away. Why she's so good. But God Damn, she's hilarious. Like the most that has really given me a great bond and my daughter that some of these Pixar movies use music from our era. Oh, you don't know how many times she's? I'm in a car drive. I'm listening to classic rock. And she's in the back singing.

And I'm like, my deck just got odd. She knows my music.

Like she knows Yeah. Music. Yeah. And it's because of those. I don't know what Pixar movie are exactly, but they use music from our era. And she'll go daddy, I know that song. Let me see the video. Well, they do that with some movies like Marvel did it the best with Guardians of the Galaxy. Chris Pratt character is into cool old songs. Like if you ride the ride at Disney

When they have a Guardians of the Galaxy ride, and in it is all these cool songs like Jackson Five or slow ride like crazy, cool old school songs that play while he's going through his adventure. So part of Guardians of the Galaxy. He's got headphones on, What is that song he's listening to? Over and over again? Yeah, he's got this one songs. He's got an old school cassette Walkman. And he's got the headphones on his shit. And he's kicking the shit out of aliens while he's listening to this badass song. But it's like those old classics. There's something about songs that are from a different time that it's not just that it's a great song, but it's also that it's history. Like it's both things you know, you should my daughter listens to I want to kill myself.

hooked on a feeling that's it. Blue Suede. All that

drives me fucking crazy hooked. I like that one jam. You know, what's the one that came with? Miley Cyrus his father? Oh, yeah, yeah, Old Town road that was killed your fucking house. Oh my god. My kids wouldn't stop saying they wouldn't stop. My daughter was singing it. I think that's the most popular single of all time. Of all time. That's amazing. Fucking. Now you remember one thing when I first stepped foot on the stage about a year later, Billy Ray Cyrus blew up. Oh, yeah. I still remember doing open mic that followed a breakdance what was it called? Wine dancing class. Yeah, in Colorado, Nevada, Colorado on Sunday night. Oh, tell my heart. Yeah, it gave people went nuts. To see him. This is what I'm talking about that I love when people go well, Billy Ray Cyrus, he's dead. Really? No, he just showed up with a kid and blew up the fucking world. 3530 years later. I tell you what, man, his daughter is very talented. His daughter has very talented Yeah, no, she hasn't even gotten started. You don't even worry about it. If you listen to Jolene, you listen to her coverage Jolene like holy shit, man, bro. She sang some. She's saying when we leave here put on fucking the tribute to Chris Cornell. What she sang and you're gonna die. Just say goodbyes. Say hello to Avid. I get goosebumps because she she asked me let her go. Yeah, Teddy. Yeah, show up a few times. She's gonna get married a few times. Fun. She got enough dough to last three lifetimes, right? Yeah. So let her go do her thing but her true calling is I come back and she's gonna let bull the music industry. Yeah, because she's Yeah, say goodbye to her. Well, I think it's yes, it will happen. Temple of the dog say hello to heaven. Yeah, I want to hear this later. Bookmark that for me, Jamie. Kinda wish we could play music. Yes, she fucks me great. I just played music during the podcast. Yeah, we got to get some you have no idea how talented she She's phenomenal. I love her last album. Song Malibu. Have you heard? It's a great fucking song. She's just taking time off. But she's a real artist. First she got on. I'm not gonna smoke dope, like Pete Davidson. And that should last I bumped into Pete Davidson. Are you getting hygienic goes Fuck yeah.

The policies too good. I gotta be good.

Yeah, they go on that kick. They're not gonna smoke no more. You know, you gotta do selling. I love the reefer. I love it in the morning. I get I got some strawberry coffee. Are they Oh my God. Have you seen the speed weed box of doom? You got to open that thing up it lights up like like the suitcase and Pulp Fiction.

Gino? He's the boss of men this fucking and these little tobacco things.

I love you're not a boring guy. And I'm not a boy. I am a blunt guy now. I love his books. Yeah, well, you know who turned me into a Blanc is Charlie Murphy. Charlie Murphy. The first time I ever got high with him. He rolled a blind and he would do it old school he would buy packages Swisher Sweets. He'd cut those fuckers open. You know a lot of guys break them up with their finger. I don't remember if he broke it open with his finger but Charlie knew how to roll a blunt like he would roll a blunt You know who else rolls a blunt real good. Luis Gomez. Luis Gomez rolls a legit blunt breaks down the tobacco takes the fucking leaf out, flattens the leave rolls the weed inside of it perfect blunt, like skills. Like I admire dudes who can fix things. And I admire dudes who could roll a tight joint. You know, like a dude who knows how to fix an engine like oh, you carburetors this and that we're just gonna run the line. We'll clear it out and then we'll add new spark plugs and like a bow. I can't do that. I gotta hire a guy to do that. I can't turn the wrench. I'm not good at it. I never learned I admire it. I could. I could I could fuck him rolling nasty joint. I admire that. I can't

And the blunted special thing you got to learn how to break down the tobacco cheat sometimes and by the blood wrap. But it's just not the same. You know, last week I called yet I did Burt's thing. And he had a Cuban dude doing cigars. And Burt said to me as your question what if I gave me a noun to dope? Can you roll it up and he rolled it up into cigars? Oh my God, and they will fucking tremendous. I mean, fucking tremendous. Tommy Chong gaming this?

Yeah, it's too big.

It's all cute. It starts off cute. Like, you burn you burn, and then tribute it to and I don't want to light it though. I'll miss it. I like keeping it right here on my desk. This was as a kid when I was little big bamboo. My stepdad had a big bamboo and I listened to it when I was like, I mean, I couldn't have been more than nine. I was nine years old and I was listening to that and I have Sister Mary our family. I don't remember. I remember it I think big bamboo was the one where the like Dave's not here man. I think that was that one.

Just to know those guys fucking genius was that Tommy Chong is a goddamn genius. So it's cheap that they still put they put a rolling paper in the thing and yeah, the album was rolling paid. Yeah, system elephant. Yes, Ralph and Herbie.

Let's make a dope deal. That's right. Let's make a dope deal.

If you want me to tell you something. This is why I got into podcasting. This was my biggest appeal about podcasting that guys like you and I grew up listening to Pryor. Yeah, John. Carlin and I'm like, I listened my mind.

choice as a kid where there were three by Richard Pryor.

This one and I liked that Lenny Bruce lived in Carnegie Hall for some ways. That's my collection of stand up comedy. I love a bicentennial. Negative, negative crazy. And is it something Was it something I said? That's Richard prize. Best work. Those are great, great.

Great, great albums, but just raw and it makes you listen. You know, this year, was the first time since 1987. That the album's outsold DVDs. They're making a big comeback. Really. We made a big fucking mistake. 30 years ago, we all drank the fucking Kool Aid and it wasn't worth it. There was some jerk off people, you know, again.

We were we were doing great with the album. The music industry was doing great with a thing called the why because you want to buy kiss on Saturday. This fucking guy wants to buy Led Zeppelin on the side and I want to buy REO Speedwagon. You all got paper outs on Saturday, we got to walk down to the fucking record store. Look around, he changed his mind. He went with Jethro Tull. Then we went back to your house because your mom worked on Saturdays and we got two joints, and we rolled them up in the arm and it was a process you put the outline and you rolled and you read the lyrics and you read the things that they put in it. And they took that away from you. And they gave you the first dudes with a dude you went to the real the real? You Oh yeah. Oh, really, really the way to go? I've heard people that I didn't know anybody personally. Yeah, nobody was buying them. You know? You got to show up with a movie thing to listen to.

And you got to scroll it and the whole thing so that went out fucking quick then they switch to something else. And then we settled know the eight track was already gone. Pretty much that's right track started to move out. Cassette was big. Because that's what Big Five What's that many desks? Many desks? Many this Wow. And then I remember the CD but then I still remember buying like movies. Like going oh me but buying the movie opening up the thing and it just be like an advertiser and a fucking CD. And that's when I stopped I go this is what I'm getting for my money now. So when I buy a fucking CD from a record label, I opened it up to see the would have been even don't even put time into the cover anymore. When you buy Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here out Jesus Christ. They must have put a year just into the cover. The guy shaking the guy's hand at Warner Brothers the other guys like on fire. Yeah, they put time and so I think that everybody kept saying sound well, the sound CD didn't listen. Just to put that fucking needle on there again. I wonder how many fucking turntables are sold in America last year for the album to come back? And I have one in my office and I go to I go to two different places one on headphones or do you listen to speakers when I listen in the office I put them on with the

had the speakers at the office. It's when I listened to it at home, I got the headphones.

It's

it's a different experience, right? You're like you're sitting down like you're watching a show almost. The thing about music, when I'm streaming it is I'm almost always doing something.

Very rarely just listening to music. I'm always listening to music while I'm driving or listening to music while I'm working out or while flying. I don't hardly ever just listen to music, or sit down. But when you have an album and you have a record player, I think that

would definitely make you more inclined to treat it like an event. You know.

Just have a cup of coffee, smoke a joint, sit on the couch, just listen to it. Just listen to it. Listen to some bars. You know, listen, I get anxiety about 28 Every night 2008 2008 right around that same time. Yeah, because for years, that's when I was thinking about how I was going to score coke.

So till this day, that's the PTSD I got that at 730 I started getting anxiety, I start getting itchy. I gotta move I gotta make them. And when I finally what I really wanted intended to do was to maybe go to jujitsu it

but

you know, my boy just got a 530 class. I've been trying to make him for three weeks. 530 is just rough. Or metallic o'clock in the morning typing guy 12 The latest. I used to always take to a dirty class at night. That's that's that's at this age. Yeah, it was hard to go on. It was hard to go on after onstage afterwards to there was no no I like I don't mind all that it's just

rolling in everything to kid what you're not fucking killing yourself for an hour and a half. You should you know you warm up and you drill the technique and then you fucking you know, for me, I do three rolls and I gotta go after that. I'm just it's a loaded admission when I was training in 10th planet all the time with Eddie's nighttime class 830 Class A month filled with murderers. It was

it was killer be killed. And then you'd go all nice guys. So I don't want to meet it in a bad No, no, no, no. They're just really good. But you would go from that and then go I'd go on stage I feel spent. Sometimes I'd go on stage afterwards. I'd have flat sets because I was just too tired. I was just too mellowed out. I just you know been spent 90 minutes with guys on your back trying to strangle you and try to it's just you get there like you don't have the same pop. You work on at night still. I like to work out all different hours of the day. So what I like to do when you work that night, all the time, like three days ago maybe? What time late 1030

I wish I could do it people are asleep. That's what I like to do when people are asleep. I put fights on put fights on just you know got all the shit they're gonna kettlebells there. I got a bar there got chin up bars got you know, things to do that glue paint glute ham machine to do sit ups off of that and back extent I would just do like, nine sets of kettlebells like swings and lanes, couple goblet squats. And I'd be happy like at 1030 It's a zone at seven o'clock though. 738 o'clock. I gotta rush. But not it's not really it's kind of exercise. But I gotta get out of the house. So I usually go by the office. Due to bang it's I listen to one side of it.

I just pick on some nights it's comedy. Some nights it's fucking rock music. And once the album is over, I shut it up with the album Back on the covenant again the chronic gone like not not most of the nights I do that. I really don't have nothing to do. So I got a half hour window with you know, put her in the tub I leave by the time I come back. Nobody knows not let me ask you this, do you when you when you're writing comedy, like when you're when you're working on bits? Are you

how much time you spend in offstage? And like how do you do it? Like, are you are you one of those guys that just has an identity drive around? I know a lot of guys doing like write and shut down. They just have an idea and they just bounce around while they're driving around. And then like maybe they'll remember some bullet points or they'll bounce it off a friend and then they'll try to do it on stage. How are you doing it?

Now because I'm very serious about it

it starts with a pad and a piece of paper and pray to God that could that I could just remember the idea to get it out at me at the Comedy Store. Right I just want to get the idea. Let's worry about the joke later.

So that's the first time right get so you have a premise so you get let's structure the premise. Let me get this out. I want to talk about that Netflix show don't fuck with cats. I keep forgetting.

Don't fuck with cats.

This was rule number one that they told me when I moved from cube I threw a rock at a cat when they had a black guy go yo, and fuck with the motherfuckers

some dude on the internet decide to fuck with cats. And have you watched the doctor series know it's gonna blow your mind

it's gonna blow your mind it's a Netflix show flicks 10 Episode document we had something you're gonna show that's what did you get me involved in Joe Diaz. It's called don't fuck with don't fuck with cats. I think it's my three episodes. I watched two of them last night actually, like good but yeah, it's like remember the old school internet shit from the early 2000s where there was weird shit online. Yeah, people are discovering who the fuck was doing some of that and like fall they fell down some fucking weird holes. Oh, really? This is crazy shit. Yeah, disturbing as fuck is it three episodes because I think I believe so. Yeah, watch three. Yeah, yeah, I think I thought it was more it's called don't fuck with cat.

That's it. That's it.

Because this is how the party starts. Oh my god.

Tremendous. And you know while she's on TV last week, the reason why I called you I didn't want to tell you until afterward I wanted to talk to you about on the show. A boy made a comeback. He didn't know he got another week and a half left to live who? Michael Bowden made a comeback because of the Epstein family Michael baton baton Yeah, the Epstein family. Yeah, to do a private watch on 60 minutes. I did. Okay, that's my boy. Yeah, boy. Violent show. You and me both. Oh my god. I remember having conversations about with you about saying you can't commit a crime with that guy around guys too good. Because once he gets on it the most memorable thing he ever busted was you ready for this G he found they found the torso in New Jersey belong to a woman. The guy did a great job. He cut a waist. He cut arms ahead and he threw her whole body into the ocean the sharks got everything except the torso. Torso just washed up in a seaside it to some Jersey Shore town. You remember this episode? Katarina, and she fucking had faked its

serial numbers from the tits. That's not who she was. But no, no, it gets better. He went deep into the murky waters. He also went into his stomach. And the food that she had eaten had been processed. So there was certain clam

it was a certain type of clam that couldn't be found. It wasn't that and it could either been Boston or New Jersey. I'm not putting the blame on no by right I remember that. No. So he found that her whereabouts and he found that he called like every restaurant in that area to see who would have that specific type of clamp.

And he fucking caught the killer because he paid for with his credit card.

Whoa.

So he went and found that this specific clam what restaurant in that area so that and that's what she had enough stomach. They weren't cherry stones are the other ones. There were the other ones. There was the most horrific story from that one. One episode where they had this guy believe he was a doctor, and he was infatuated with this woman who was this patient. And when she died, he I think he had married her one time or something like that. He had some kind of relationship with her. He dug up her body and kept it in his house. And it put it tube where her vagina is so he could still have sex there. And he he was buying cases in cases of perfume. And I think that's what tip people off. Because this guy was buying cases of perfume because she was rotting in his bed. So he would cover her with perfume. And this is

autopsy or top HBO autopsy. Yeah. Fucking great show. Great show. And then we'll come on like one. So he studies Jeffrey Epstein. And he finds out that there's breaks in Jeffrey Epstein's neck. That is he's never seen ever in a hanging and only seen from strangulation only see from murderers. They said that he hung himself. Yeah. Am I retarded? I'm am I the only one that's missing this? They're trying to find it's a four foot wall. Yeah, he threw himself against the wall and went down was really the neck had blood, but the fucking thing didn't have blood on it. It's such a horrible fucking thing. Yeah, the cops the overtime they had been working. The tapes got shut off. How about the fact that they deleted the first tapes? Oh, it's so he went he had an original attempt on his life. And then they had a second one. And they can't find the tapes for the second one. And then they accidentally deleted the tapes in the first one. I mean, this. It's not 1930 it's 2020 if they can get away with that in 2020. I mean, I don't know how far

Are anyone's gonna track this down? How far like how motivated they are? Well, the the reason why he got arrested in the first place, is because people did talk about it. And they did get motivated to do something. Because they're like, how does a guy get arrested for having sex with underage kids, and then only get like 13 months. And then during that 13 months, he had basically he was like, he just had to return at night.

Right? He didn't, he had the ability to travel and go wherever he wanted at 16 hours, like work release for the day could go to his office, he could do what you did, literally all you do is sleep there every night. So it was an inconvenience, an inconvenience for him. And everybody's like, what? And then when you start thinking about the stories, and the jet and the island and all the craziness, like this is not a movie, this is real. This is not a movie, there was an island, where an intelligence agent would take

scientists and heads of state and they would bank checks. That intelligence thing is

I'll just say strong rumor, because it's only been mentioned by a few people and like that ABC report didn't mention it at all. Maybe they left it out. I don't think they can prove it. When someone says something. And then that I mean, is there a recording of that guy saying who remember the guy that said that he was told that it was that Epstein was intelligence he was above his pay grade Acosta? Yes, he was his name again.

I don't know the Alexander Acosta, Jim.

We got fired though. Or he had to resign after they went and looked into this and you got rearrested. I have not seen bombshell. Have you seen bombshell? That's that new shot? He's dead wrong. She plays Megyn Kelly, right. Roger Ailes. Yeah. And it's all about the sexual harassment. And I was watching. The ladies watched it together, the actual women that were that lived it, and then they afterwards, they talked about it. They talked about what was real and what was not real. But one thing that was real is Roger Ailes would make them stand in front of him and twirl around. So you can see their ass so he can see their house. And like So imagine you're a woman you get this job. You're gonna be an anchor. Like I'm really excited to work for you, Mr. Ailes. Thank you. Alright, this one I want you to I want to see your ass while you spin around.

And so he I mean, that's a weird. Is that a real picture?

Photoshop for press release. It doesn't look fake. Doesn't look like a fake picture. They probably weren't all next to each other. Hmm.

What is Megan Kelly complaining about? She was sexually harassed. Oh, yeah. Everybody was? Box. Yeah, apparently this guy Roger. That's his name. Roger Ailes. Right. What they're saying is that, you know, he would say I want to see you naked. I want to see you in lingerie. I want to see naked pictures of you. It was just a dirty old fat dude, who just harass the fuck out of all the women that work there. And that was how they did.

Is that in the movie? Yeah, that's in the movie. Yeah, that's John Lithgow. Right. They put him in a fat suit. Right. Didn't make him get that fat. I don't think so. That's a lot of weight. Yeah, that's some heart attack shit. He's a fairly healthy guy.

But that guy's dead. Right? Did he die? I think Roger l died.

I'm pretty sure.

Look at him.

Go back to those pictures. Go back to images.

I mean, look at that one. The one in the middle. Look at the one in the middle up top with his red tie out. Yeah, right there. Look at that. I mean, if he was alone with her, What the fuck do you imagine you would say what kind of creepy shit? Do you imagine that? Do it say?

Women always think like a guy like that. That looks disgusting. That you would never look I would never have sex with him. He knows that.

guy that's that rich and that powerful. Like and looks like that. He doesn't even probably know that he doesn't have any game. Like he probably thinks that he has game. He probably thinks this is a part of why became rich and famous in the first place. These powerful men before all this stuff went down these guys that ran these gigantic companies, and this is what they did. So they all did. And they got away with it. Everybody knew, right? I mean, how many companies? Here's the big question. How long has this been going on? How long have men and women even been working together like that? It wasn't Jordan Peterson talks about this, that it hasn't really been that long. Like,

you know, in the 1800s men and women didn't work together in offices like this. I didn't watch Mad Men but in that what that whole show is kind of about I think, I didn't watch it either secretaries, wives and husbands and yeah, it's real recent for people, for men and women to be longside each other all day that you don't even know each other and you're an

office together. Throughout all of human history, when people got together and work together, there were a tribe. There were a community. It wasn't strange, random guys that just got hired by fucking HR to come down, sit next to you in your office and ask you questions. You conduct yourself and like, like who are, you know, everybody in those days work with people they knew, right? Like if you were in a blacksmith's office, or blacksmiths workshop, everybody fucking knew everybody. They work together. One of my niece's just had to go.

And she got summoned

to talk to somebody, as you know, where she went. She's going to medical school now, where she'd got her regular,

regular degree. A couple of weeks ago, she had to go, she got to pick a letter in the mail. And they asked her about this teacher on what she thought she had to spill her guts and they had to go and talk and get this teacher fired, you know, wasn't doing anything sexual was what he was saying. Saying creepy search.

He was 60 something, you know, and he's probably doing it, to confront them. And you know,

well, that's we have to think about priests, right? They've got they're, they're still doing it. Right. They still they still keep getting caught. But they've been doing that their whole life, and the people before them did it to them. And there's generation after generation after generation of child molester priests. It's one of the craziest things that Catholics just accept that people aren't. Because most Catholics are not pedophiles. Most Catholics are good people that want a bunch of great, you know, great people to live together with certain rules. And they think if you abide by these rules, then you're doing the work of God. But the people at the top is a certain percentage of them. I don't know what the number is, that are definitely pedophiles. And it's a high number in comparison to every other job. If

25% of dentists were pedophiles, we would all have rotten teeth. You know, I'm saying, I mean, think think about all the different professions lawyers have 25% of lawyers were pedophiles. We'd like their buildings on fire. The fuck are you talking about? But for some reason, I don't know what the percentage is. I don't think it's 25% of priests. We think it is. Here's the fucking thing with the priests thing that kills me.

The priests bang worked pretty much. It was a no, no. I mean, we're talking about the 60s and 70s. I did a Google search. On the grammar school, I went to just a look. Just the look. I went to Sacred Heart School for Boys. And one day I went on then one night, I was high. And I would just went on a Google search and went down a foxhole and one of the couple Reddit pages of people saying different things. And you know what, I swear to God, there was nothing about Sacred Heart School for Boys and that you couldn't find them. But I looked up a different church that was close to my house. And it was 200 cases.

Nobody gets prosecuted, and they move into another archdiocese. And you start your little charade again. And then when you start, like say, you fuck up for fucking different states. Like let's say you go from Jersey, to Minneapolis, to San Diego into Louisiana, then they ship you overseas.

Once too many letters start to come in about the situation then they ship you overseas, and they'll put you at the fucking Vatican or whatever. That's what's got me fired up. I grew up in this. Did I get molested as a kid? No. Did a priest bother me? No, I wish I could sit here and die. Was I an altar? Boy? No, I worked the bingo. So I didn't really have much contact with the fucking priests. You know, when I did, Vinnie brands, we did the stress factory. One of my friends sat in the front row. He was my neighbor. He lived two doors down next to us. And after the show, we were laughing. And we were laughing about the pedophiles in the neighborhood, how we would torment them. Like we knew they were paedos we had a guy that played to entitle us with No wonder we're on Puerto Rican Nelson. And then his law was ice cream. We take the ice cream and then we come to go fuck himself. fucky when I go back to the apartment will fucking kill you. You know, you knew they got pointed up the story I tell about New York about the fucking

the guy that used to chase little kids and that's a true story. It's not a joke. It's a joke on stage. But that's a true story. You know who the kids the people were in your neighborhood that got called out in the 70s and 80s You know, don't fuck with that dude. Yeah, you know there's a there's a cop in my neighborhood where I grew up. I just found this out. I just found this.

At there's a cop in my neighborhood that was dear friend that I grew up with. He had two younger brothers that were twins.

One of the younger brothers went to jail for murder. He killed this fucking gay guy.

What just came out was that that gay guy was molesting him. He gave him a summer job

when he was in the eighth grade and started molesting him,

and they still reduce the sentence, you know, he went back a murder as an adult.

He came back when they when he was 30 fucking murdered him. I think they gave him six years for involuntary manslaughter. He pleaded down, but this is you know,

it's you don't want I don't know when it comes to my dorm trust nobody. And you set a joke up on stage the one that I know it's not a joke. I'll keep you. Yeah, I'm going to keep shooting it. And whoever your mother your wife, I'm going, I'm going. That's why it's better that like Cuban parents, you can sleep over here. We didn't send them my kid nowhere.

Because this is how it starts. Did you watch them in Neverland? No, I didn't. Okay, never. Neverland is just turned out. What is it escaped from Neverland? What are you talking about? Hey, by. So God, it's Monday. That's something for the spirits might have to learn how to join knots. Yeah, you might. Yeah, you have to get another join. Because I'm ready to rock and roll. You got one of these blondes anymore. Blonde. Yeah. I'm gonna grab one.

Sorry about that fart joke. I've experienced it before. No, I've had I don't want to lose weight protein.

I can't even

I showed you.

I'm sorry. I was looking for a percentage number. I just tried to find the number of priests versus accusations. But Los Angeles, it seems like 10% of the priests, maybe about 600 Priests and it's still the least 70 of them or so have been accused. Oh, god dammit. That might be high might be low. I don't know. That's a lot. If that's the nationwide thing, imagine if that's the same. It's mirrored or even worse. Well, now 3 billion today? Have you seen it running an ad? Have you been molested by a Boy Scout? Or a fucking priests call this number. It's never too late. Bla bla bla bla bla bla, blah.

You know, now you they paid out 3,000,000,500 Plus, just in Los Angeles, oh my god.

10 years ago, right? That was 10 years ago. So they might go crazy that no one ever says hey, maybe this isn't really what God wants. Maybe,

you know, I'm saying I mean, the people that are in the church, the people that are believers, the people that love the dress up nice, and go and behave kind and see all the people in the community at the church. There's a good feeling that people get from going to church. But the fact that it's connected to that is, it's, it's so insane, that it's still there. It's so insane that it hasn't been routed out. And this is still a giant problem. And relatively few people are going to jail. Like relatively few, like you know who they wanted. They wanted that Ratzinger that Pope Ratzinger. That's one of the reasons why he had to step down. And one of the reasons why he stays in the Vatican, I was reading some article about them bringing up charges crimes against humanity against him that other countries wanted to do that because this guy used to ship kids, or he used to ship priests to places where they wouldn't get in trouble. Like, yeah, this one guy was accused of molesting boys. And so he shipped them to this place where he worked with dead deaf kids. And he molested over 100 Deaf kids.

It's like, what did you do?

Like you shipped a child molester to a bunch of people that wouldn't be able to talk about it? Well,

like you'd be able to get away with it easier there. If they settled a case, and that means it doesn't get prosecuted, right. So that's why they won't go to jail. Is that why they haven't gone to jail? today? I don't understand it.

Reports on why aren't they going to jail and like, if you settle a case, you don't do that on court? Like they don't keep prosecuting. I just I guess if you make us like the person decides to drop charges. There was a guy Boston, they were gonna fucking give 100,000 We're gonna put him on the jail.

There was some time Boston I read about years ago to jail. Now I keep it simple. I'm still a Catholic. I just don't go to church. I don't want to deal with none of those people. I don't want to deal with another. Yeah. At any religious level. I don't want to deal with them. The problem is whenever people get into a position where everybody for the most part is like, humble around them, and scared of them, and they have power. Like I remember when my grandmother died. We went to a funeral. And the guy couldn't remember her name. My grandma's name was Josephine and he kept calling her Geraldine. And the priest who was delivering the service. We had to interrupt him say, Josephine, and he was like, annoyed that they interrupt him like, yes, Josephine. Like he he chose

means the net like he didn't even know her name.

And when he's there to deliver this God's message for the last, you know, last time, the fan was going to view the body.

And he doesn't know our name. And when he was corrected, he was angry at us.

Like he had these Gin Blossoms all over his face. He's just some weird old guy who got tricked into

this very strange life. And now it's at its end. And he's been living with robes on supposedly being celibate his whole fucking life, while people kiss his ass and pretend to do something special because he talks about the Word of God. But you could just see in that one moment where he wasn't even embarrassed that he said the wrong name. He was upset that people were correcting him because you don't correct priests. So he's used to that. So there's no one checking him. There's no one checking them at all. Everyone who goes there is in the state of worship. And they're the ones who deliver the Word of God dressed like wizards, like they're the only people in society that are allowed to dress like wizards in modern American society. They dress like fucking wizards. And we're like, yeah, that's how a father dresses. Father dresses like a wizard. Like, you know, people are gonna look back at that and go, Why didn't they think the outfits were weird? Why didn't they think it was silly? This pedophile dresses up like a wizard. And you're not supposed to say anything to him. What is that? Like? What is what is what the outfits the fact that all that shit still around? I just nowhere in the Bible that says priests have to dress like that. Nowhere. There's nowhere.

The whole thing is so bizarre. It's you're wearing stuff that made you look like you were very special to really poor people 500 years ago, that's what you're wearing. You wearing stuff that would impress people that didn't know any better that probably couldn't read. And so before Martin Luther translated these, the scriptures so that people could read it like a phonetic language. Before that people had no idea what what the priests were reading, they just relied on the priest. They relied on the priest to tell them what the Word of God was. Now listen, they could read it for themselves. And Martin Luther was saying he should probably interpret it yourself too. And they were like, Oh my god. So what's it were either of you old enough to go to church when it was still in Latin? Oh, they would say something uses only be in Latin until 70s or 60s. Something really? Yeah, I remember they would say some things in Latin because I remember I'd be five years old going What in the fuck are these peoples? What type of kid were you between the age of five and 10? Were you aggressive? Were you quiet, we are much more introverted. Okay. From the ages of five and 10. I went through I changed and I got hit with a lunchbox. But I believed I really did believe Joe. I really do believe I believe in God. I believe that my father was in heaven. I believe that I taught a shit. Yeah. Then I got introduced to Catholic school. And that just fucked me up completely. Because I believed but I didn't believe on the tail end of it if it was supposed to be loving, licensed, non smacking me.

Why is this not hitting me with a fucking ruler? What What? What?

And then I saw the anger in their heart. And it turned me off completely. Like I didn't like it. Today. I'm still a Catholic with some boards. Yeah, when my body goes like to go through a fucking church, you know, but I don't hold it. I remember

selling cars in Boulder. And a guy came in and we started talking and he was 50 wasn't a good looking guy look like that fucking guy, the 20 year old check with him.

And obviously have to take him on my demo ride. I figured out that he could fuck her and shit.

I realized that he was fucking or she was like his receptionist or something. Okay, but after when we got back I also realized he was my father in law's friend.

So I asked my father in law about him. He then said he's on the board of the church was he's a great man.

And I still remember him. This was Sacred Heart church in Boulder, Colorado. In fact, that's it same church, the head of the football team went to Bill McCarthy and all that shit. I'd see his fucking family there and, and they'd all sit in the front and this fucking scumbag would sit in a second pew with his fat fucking ugly wife.

She had the ugliest fucking wife in the fucking church. They would hit her with the net with that money that they would just hit it with it like fuck you. Ugly. But the point was that

I never respected it that you cheated on your wife. But then again, you're right there. Playing the fucking I'm a good guy. That's a classic story. The classic story is the big one is the anti gay pastor that turns out to be gay. There.

There's so many of them. There's some wasn't a one where a guy got busted on because he was trying to use an Arby's card was not the case.

That's a common one for anti gay pastor that turns out to be gay people. Preach the Word of the Lord. Yes.

Stay away from the K folks. Missouri church leader tried to pay for sex on Grindr with Arby's card.

Whoa, look, it's a hustle that they got away with probably forever. There's they probably hid, like, who they were and what they were doing forever with this act and this smokescreen, and you could kind of get away with it for a long time. But that you can't get away with that today.

And if you're, you know, like, why are you so great? Why are you so against gay people like one of those camps where they send you to get anti gay yes again, but they always take him a tick the Lord into you. Touch your dick is what they do that people that have been to those pray the gay away camps that claim that like guys were hugging them with full heart ons behind them, telling them it's alright that God loves them. Like this guy was pressing his dick against this guy's buttocks. Like they they made him sit like almost in a rear naked choke position, where the guy who's the counselors behind you, with his dick against your back? Like, Hey, what are you doing? Is this really God's plan? There's a South Park episode about the CDC.

pray the gay away. Oh my god. It's called cart man sucks. It's from Season 11. Episode Two 2007. Perfect. Yeah, there's been a lot of those. There's been a lot of like real recounts, you know, recounting where people went to those camps. They're like, Oh, my God, everyone was gay.

Like, everyone was like, even the counselors, the guys who were saying they were gonna pray the gay away. They were just trying to fuck you. I don't know how much fucking they do, or how much they just hang on to you back with a hard on and pretend that nothing's going on. I don't know what really goes on. But whenever you got someone who's that adamant about it, you gotta wonder. Yeah. Anybody ever tried to make a move on? You know? Yeah. When you were a kid? Yeah, couple times from five to how old? The scariest one was when I was 13. When I was 13. I was in Boston. One time it happened before but a librarian saved me. I was like eight.

I was in San Francisco. And I was really in a monster books back then. I was into monster movies and Monster books. And I was looking at these books and it's creepy dude came over to me. And he said, Do you like Monster books? And I said, Yeah. And he said, Well, I have monster books in my car. Do you want to come see him? I said, Okay, so I was eight years old. I was dumb. Started walking behind him in the library and screams out Joseph, you get away from him. He just got out of jail. I'm like, Oh my God. And the guy ran. And I ran to the librarian and she hugged me and I was crying. was very scary.

I got a call with a guy who was freezing boss wasn't common. At the basketball. I was at St. Michael's gym. I got to Kennedy Boulevard and next thing you know fucking

has no number one bus. I'm that fucking

10 below. guy pulls up. You want to ride? Yeah, get in there.

And I still remember how he acted. Like, from the beginning from the minute I got and something wasn't right. His energy wasn't right. And he thought he had he thought he had pray.

And stick he was like we were we were 18 and we were taking a girl back to our apartment. You know, we were kind of clumsy. He was clumsy. And at the light, he went for the boy he was you like playing basketball and football and they touch my deck.

Like he slipped into Kelly's Vaizey. You like it? And I was like do I fucking like it. And Joe Rogan the door open. It was like God open the fucking door and I just got out and ran. He kept saying come back. I was just teasing you Come on. I'll give you a ride. I was already home. I was at the top of shits and barn. Well, I give a fuck. But that was basic. And I always think about that. Like why didn't people approach but I knew today looking back I still number three guy I haven't met a high school teacher that would come on as a basketball guru. And I found that and I always thought a little weird about not married, you know? And then years ago somebody said yeah, he was sucking kids deck centerfield shit.

I had a guy slow play me at a lake. There was a guy that used to run around the lake and talk to us when we're fishing. We're probably like 13 Me and my friend Josh in particular, we'd go this one lake. It was in our town. And we'd fish there all the time. And this dude would come by all the time and visit he was always friendly. Start

off real normal, what are you guys up to catch the first like, Southern accent seam, I got an old gentleman.

And then a couple times he came when it was just me. And then he just sat down next to me and talked to me. And I was naive. I was 13 I just thought he was a real nice guy. Like almost like a older brother type figure. It's gonna give you a good advice. He talked about cool shit. He was a teacher. He got kicked out of his position for some unfair reason. He wouldn't really be specific about it. But he said, you know, they didn't like the way he taught.

And so anyway, this dude just becomes my friend. Like nice and slow, nice and slow brings me lunch. I even went to his house once.

And then one day, I am fishing and he's drunk.

And he tells me he loves me.

And I think I said something like, I really like you too. It goes, you know, there, there can't be love without sex.

And I remember thinking what? Whoa, like, what did he just what happened? And then I might remember thinking what a dummy I am. I thought this guy just liked me. He was I was his buddy. He's gonna teach me things. You just like teaching people. It's just really smart. That I had my hand on the knife. I had a Swiss army knife and the little red plastic ones, you know, the ones with the cannon. Yeah, they have all kinds of shit. And all I was thinking as I put it in my hand in my pocket, like I held on to it. And I remember thinking God dammit, I hope I don't have to fucking try to use this. Because I was thinking, it's like, he's, he was a big guy. You know, I was 13 I don't know what I weighed 120 pounds or something. I'm like, fuck, this guy might beat the shit out of me and rape me here in the woods. Like he was bigger than me. And he was always jogging, you know, wasn't in bad shape.

And he,

I told him to get the fuck away from me. And he told me not be upset. And then I left. I got away. He didn't chase me. You know, he didn't want to be violent. He wanted to trick me. And

he wanted he didn't want to rape me. He wanted to trick me into fucking I got real lucky that that was the case. But then years later, I got a letter from him at my house. That was creepy, because it showed up in the mailbox. Like he had figured out where I moved to.

And sent me a letter. Like, whoa, and it was like real, like friendly and professional. Like a real professor like a scholar. I don't even remember if you ever apologized.

But it was real weird. I was like, Ooh, I dodged a bullet.

How many guys that are like that but aren't nice. They just want to get you close and then rape you. That's much more likely probably.

That is some horrific shit, man. We're Puerto Rican Nelson. I went to his house. That's the name. That's what we called him. He was Puerto Rican. His name was Nelson. And we've been given that terrorists and lived next to the Latinos but in the back.

And I think he raped guys with a black dude. Like there was a black friend that his dad would come over and then they give you beer and all that shit. So he took you in As You Like buzzy

type of kid like even always, like you want to see some good buzzy and then that's how it started. Right? Yo, there you go in and it started with the porn first.

Yeah, bring your buddies anytime you want. And it was a pawn and then it would get us nickel bags weed. He started we'll I'll get your weed.

And then he introduced a black friend. And his black friend just looked fucking retarded like his Afro was cut weird. He had weird air. And I remember him distinctively speaking about the Rock of Gibraltar how he had just come back from Africa and we were young kids like wow. And then once he showed us to pull on it came out like a week later somebody said bro, that dudes no good. Ask what's his name? He went over that he had not he asked her if he could suck his

shoulder like what do we do here? We call the cops or do we tell calm? I'm like no, let's just play the guy because he was selling this weed. He was like a bartender in the city must sell this weed.

And then he pursued the porno thing with us is that you guys don't understand. You know and then he talked the center he like I'm gonna fuck my girlfriend come over and listen.

And we would come over there at night and listen that he would leave the window open. And it was his girlfriend and fucking that she would be saying Give it Give me milk daddy.

Daddy like get creeped out and ran out there one day

And then one day we actually fucking went back then he got normal. I think with the misunderstanding with the one guy he got normal like we somebody checked them. And he got normal. And then like the next summer was when he would come out and play football with us with a robot. No wonder what

is Deckard?

Well, like, what the fuck is this guy doing? Like he went to desperate measures aversion. And I think Mrs. Inoty said something to him. You can't be doing that around here. We did that guy. And he's like, no, no, I just want to get exercises on like, he told us I'm weird. And that was the end of that. You know, what's the classic relationship? The classic relationship

with with crazy old gay guys, is the crazy old gay guy and the young guy that's having sex with him for money. Right? There's a lot of those cases. Is that more accepted in the gay community that is the straight community? Because like it was straight community, if a guy is paying a girl for sex, it's prostitution. And everybody's upset. But is that how it is in the gay community? Like two guys give a fuck? Like, how many gay prostitutes get arrested? Is it even close to as many as straight ones? Like I would assume? I would assume like no one's getting arrested. Like is that how many

gay prostitutes get arrested? I think they do. You think there's just less number? So it's probably how would

you think there's less of them?

Probably less than overall, just for the numbers. Yeah, we live in a place it's made of dreams and people fucking have dreams. Though. Dwayne.

Dwayne from Joe Rogan. I mean, look at all the situations we've discussed just today alone RV, Eric Epstein Bikram? You know, Marilyn Monroe. That guy two weeks ago that two people died of speed in his house. That fucking nutcase. And that same guy at Buck that more people died there. No, no, I'm just saying that yeah, he finally got arrested.

Oh, I thought you know, we're living in oh my god, it's such a shame that that's what you do for a living is fuck with people's dreams? Well, I think that Ed Buck guy is probably just a serious addict

who's got some money, right? You know, taking it on this guy and shooting them up with drugs. With drugs. We let you know when I first got here the hot book was you'll never work in this town again. It was a hookah who fucking did a tell all book about Don Henley calling her up to a house and they had a bend over. And Don Henley would snort coke off to her asshole. And then get up plugged in once and sit back down and just sit there. So you had to go to Don Henley's house, he had a fireplace for women and he would just say bend over naked. God damn, snort coke. Get up fuck you for a minute and then sit back down. It's not Miko. You know, she told all those stories of different movies would be like that. I would be disappointed if he lived any other way. I would think that if you're living back then to Rockstar back then, like you almost were required to do something ridiculous. Like everybody was doing ridiculous shit. Like, no, there was no like, clean and sober. rockstars back then where they're like that hadn't even happened yet where people cleaned up. Like people clean up regularly. Now it's a big part of society, like people improve. How many people cleaned up back in the day?

Right, like artists, artists that were like really into drugs. They just died. They just die. Yeah, they didn't really know Kurt would obviously suicide or whatever. Depending on which documentary you're into the creepiest fucking thing I saw was 1983. I went back to New York I got a job and electrical warehouse close with electric

and I had a load trucks. My job was I get in the morning. Look at the bill of ladings you know, put 12 Fucking 12 feet piping a truck wiring screws. And it was just one fucking drive around. I was 45 years old and his wife was 15.

Whoa, and he would bring it at work with

Jesus. She'd be in the front seat. He did not go to school. The owner knew everybody knew. He if you looked at him, you could tell he wasn't all there. And I'm a mass of them. Once I just just your daughter. That's my wife. I go she's 1514 years. Yeah, the parents sold it to me. Oh, Jesus Christ.

I forget what his name was or where he lived. No, he will live to Western New York. He was a white dude from West New York. But he? You don't but Don Johnson married Melanie? Melanie Griffith before she was 18. Really? Yeah, look at that. She was nobody said Dec. Was that. The other boy look at you

That dude they're gonna throw him on the chair when they get rid of finished with our Kelly, if you think how we Weinstein's in trouble at least how we got to Marvy whatever how we Harvey at least he's got some money left our Kelly's done and like we will fuck it nobody said nothing our Kelly used bribe to marry Alia when she was 15 charges say he brought the government employee 1994 so that he could obtain a fake ID for the singer Alia

Yeah, this is 20 Some years ago, right? He did this he's gonna take us throw him under the fucking jail. He was holding them women captive fucking with the hedge you not allowed to talk to your fucking parents? You know? Was it all that age? Is it all like in the 50s? That's what he's into? Is that what he's Yeah, yeah, they get the video of him pissing on a check, which I never saw. I don't want to see it. I mean, I have no fucking desire to see that shit. What do you think that is? You think he's basically like,

like running a little bit last week and he comes across to you he is professionalism. Listen.

Some people know whom to do when they see. And that's what these women is saying that is professional is skill is the art of the wounded woman. And then he plays wounded. But then what do you talk to her that within the first day of day they got sexually harassed? Not too many people. So as soon as he started that you start with your story about your uncle. And he's gonna take k and he's gonna do this. And so that's how he went in the stories that these women are saying it's just fucking crazy. Like, it's just other level fucking craziness.

My manipulation, you know, it's just deep old school pimping? Me, you and I went to see American pimp. Yeah. And went to that barbecue place. You took me to a good barbecue place next door to an American, that was the US brothers. Just that mentality of spotting those type of weapons. You know, it's fucked up. It's horrible. And I feel terrible about it. And it just makes me feel sick of hearing the story. But what makes me laugh, is if we found out that JLo had been capturing 15 year old boys and pissing in the face, we would think it was hilarious.

If JLo went to high school, and she got all these sophomores, and she brought them back to her place for a gangbang we would think these kids had a good fucking time. That is what it's, it's one of those big giant differences between the way we feel about men and women. This R Kelly thing is horrible. But it is it is kind of funny that if our Kelly was like a really beautiful woman, and she she was doing the exact same thing to 15 year old boys making them live with her and either posting in chat, we would need to larious we would just think it's hilarious. Donna's doing it. Yeah. Madonna is doing it. He does not read or write exceedingly well, except when it comes to amazing musical tracks. His attorney said.

Okay,

he doesn't read or write well, that's

the whole thing is that it is weird art our ideas of sex based on gender. It's fucking very different. Very, we feel very different about that story. There'll be a hilarious story. If there was some big tidied freak singer, who has a little sex call and she brings 1516 year old boys over. We wouldn't really, we would be like, Wow, but we wouldn't feel like a crime guy committed

hypocrites because I make jokes of it on Twitter, I see it. Another 16 year old teacher sucks addict, you know, but then you think Jesus Christ, I have a daughter who swings both ways, right? So we're hypocrites, and we're hypocrites. And who we you know, for years, we heard about Michael Jackson as people look you in the fucking face and go Michael Jackson never touched a kid. Yep. People will look you in the face today and say, OJ Simpson and kill that bitch. There's people that are gonna think what they think Joe Rogan. So

yeah, I don't obviously have any idea what happened with Michael Jackson. But I would assume that there was something wrong, just based on the way he behaved. I would say like one of the things are weird about the way you behave. The way you talk is weird. Like everything about you is like you're so so shattered by this whole fame thing and you're constantly getting plastic surgery to the point where nobody can even recognize you anymore. I mean, we never saw that before. That's the first superstar we ever saw. That like literally became a different human being like changed. His face changed. His nose changed. His chin changed everything. The complexion of his skin the color of his eyes, like everything, just kept fucking with his face, his nose would collapse. And we were all aware of it. We're like, whoa,

Joe Rogan here's what you when you watch never Neverland. I want you to watch it alone. And I want you to watch it from the perspective of what you've seen as a comedian.

What is it actually called Escape from Neverland? Whatever the fuck you never never I don't know Finding Neverland Don't worry, I'll take the fucking napkin. You know, I'm not a pig. I know the napkins Baba. No, it doesn't bother me at all. What I'm gonna say to you guys,

when you when you watch this movie,

you're gonna get it the same way I got it.

The lucky thing is that people like you and I didn't drink the Kool Aid. You and I have been at the store and you and I have had discussion. And you and I have seen it's 2020 whatever the fuck it is. I know you've since 9798. We've seen 1000 comics. come and go. Yeah, some of it is addiction. Some of this lifestyle wasn't for them. But there's a percentage of them that one day you were talking to them about writing jokes. The next day, they were talking to you about scripts and producing they just lost their fucking mind and drank the Kool Aid. And because they drank the Kool Aid. Now they come back to calm and it's been four years that they've been playing that little fucking stupid charade. And they lost all the steam all this thing. There's a lot of guys who are promising comics who wanted to doing that. And they want to bring in these scripts to Comedy Central and all these places I'm executive producing this and that and that and this and then it all dries up and then they their act is not good anymore. So when you watch

this never Neverland, you're gonna see people who got caught up Joe Rogan.

People who lived in Simi Valley and when they Michael Jackson came to your house and paid your bills and said, You know,

I'm gonna take you guys on the road with me. You're all included. It starts off with the room down the hall. And then next thing you know, he's in the room next to you. There's no more rooms on levels in the same hotel. So you're in a hotel next door to you. But your son your daughter really wants

to sleep Michael Jackson, Jerome Daddy. Oh, because you're getting thrown. You know you're getting thrown money to go out to dinners. Oh, am I was picking up to go see you too. You're gonna leave your two daughters with fucking Michael Jackson.

Caught up. This town is about getting caught up. I'm sure Maryland on rolling come to this down thinking she was gonna be sucking Kennedy's deck. Champion kindness deck. And fucking the baseball players deck. Yeah. You know, they passed her around. She was sucking. She was passing mom information to the Kennedys and back and forth. Did you ever think about fucking that? Yeah. I mean, not. Not Marilyn Monroe. Yeah, yeah. To what the fuck I am talking about one of them. One of them was fucking Kennedy. Oh, she did? Yeah. Marilyn. Marilyn, this town has, you know, it's always been that way. We were talking about Fatty Arbuckle earlier. What we pick and choose? You don't think that nobody knew about Harvey Weinstein. Nobody knew about Harvey Weinstein. Nobody knew that you could tell him. Have you seen the video where Ricky Gervais jokes around about them being friends with Harvey Weinstein, in the last Golden Globes. And then there's a whole series of people thanking Harvey getting up there and thanking Harvey. All these including people that have accused him of things, getting up there and thanking them and talking about how they wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Harvey Weinstein. I mean, it's like fucking 10 minutes long. It's all these famous people thanking Harvey or God lol and everybody's laughing like people, people were just giving them so much praise all these like super famous actors. Daniel Day Lewis, everybody, you name it, everybody.

Faye Dunaway, whoever they're all up there thinking Harvey Weinstein. He's amazing. Harvey, you're incredible. It's, it's

it's crazy if you stop and think about how recent that was.

And nobody knows.

I don't think they knew unless he did it to them. What it was, you know, I think there's there's a an innocence to a lot of people's perceptions about people like that. Is that like, both parties are in on it. Right? Like the girl wants to go to him because he is going to offer her a role in a movie. And he wants the girl to come to him because she's hot and he wants his dick sucked. And they both know it. Right? There's those cases. But those are very different than the ones where he holds the girl down or he takes off his robe and she expected it to be a real script. And

those are very, very different things. And I don't know if people knew about those. I think they thought it was more of the former than the latter. I think they thought it was more

Like, creepy deals he made with actresses but kept his word and they sucked his dick. But then when you get the other stories makes me go okay. It's probably because

they knew. But the people around him knew he's a pig, but probably didn't know what the worst accusations were. You know?

I just didn't want that to that could be committed. They know what they didn't want to know. They had to go to his party's data either this meals they had to attend this functions, but that didn't really pass a line. Yeah, those people too. Right. And then amazing movies too. And in a way it's just as guilty. If I tell you right now, I'm going to shoot Redman and you sit here I shoot red bang.

You get prosecuted?

Oh, that's right. Yeah, you get like an accessory your knowledge. So you know, when when Epstein or Weinstein or whatever the fucking guys were doing what they were doing. You had a no

I take you to a bar. Within 20 minutes you will look at me and go look at these guys don't

right or wrong? True, right? I go to fucking Dan Tanis to eat. I see a guy. I see a guy working the fucking. I see a chick work. I mean guy for the small nickel.

I even heard the guy look at him go 500

It was that first row where you sit in the bars right there. 24 months ago must have been. You know, it's this is it. Yeah. Well remember when the guy from the Clippers got in trouble? what's that guy's name? The owner? Yeah, right. What's his name?

Sterling Sterling. Donald Donald Sterling. Right? When he got got recorded, saying the chair. Yeah, it was a girl that he was banging with this girl. He had bought her a penthouse. He bought her Ferrari butter a Bentley. It's just and she was for him super hot. Like look at her. That is a pretty girl. And he's a disgusting looking old man. Right? So that was his Uber side piece. So he would just buy her everything. But after a while she's like, he'll enough. EO.

Pretty hot, though. In like, that kind of trashy way.

Now was that in May two situation. Oh, that's listen. That was he was clear. And she was clear. They were both doing it for very specific reasons. He bought her a bunch of really nice shit. And he was rich. And she was hot. And that's is that her now? What's that state? Face like I started wearing if you want to get seen? Oh, that was back in the day when pepper ROTC. Yeah, let me

let me ask you that match you. You bump into this? Brooke Ah, okay, at the Web Store.

Is it a meet two situation if you don't listen? Are you working?

Let me ask your question. What I think they have to come to you first. What? Okay. 500 fell on my pocket. You suck me, you know, is a useless thing. Prostitution, or useless thing and agreement? Or is that a me too situation? It's all the above? I think

the only way people would be comfortable with it. And even then they probably wouldn't like, like, if, if you believe in people's rights, you have the right to do anything. Well, you also have the right to be a hoe if you wanted to be. So if the only way would ever be okay. Is if she made it clear that she was willing to have sex for money. And this was her choice, and she could do with her body then people probably leave you alone, but even then they'd be mad at you. They'd be willing to pay for sex you fucking disgusting piece of shit. You're supposed to pretend that you don't want to have sex with her and then you wouldn't be willing to pay for it.

It would only be okay in everybody's eyes if it was the woman's choice. But every time we think about if you think about sex for money, everybody on at least I do. I automatically think about sex trafficking, which is like the worst possible case scenario. Right? If you go to a prostitute that that prostitute is that's that's a sex slave. Right? That was the thing that they got the craft guy. They were they were using a false accusation against that guy that got jerked off. You know the guy on the page. Yeah, guys just trying to get jerked off Jesus Christ leave him alone. His wife died a bunch of years ago. So he goes to this place did just regular hookers. They jerked him off. And then he got in real trouble. They were sitting there we're trying to connect him to like sex slavery. It turned out that wasn't the case. These are just massage ladies at church you off like those that are real overwhelming. I'm sure in the valley, all that whole strip. You got to be careful what you walk into. You got to be careful the place I go to

which is fucking tremendous. Look at this. I mean, just to show you looking at my punch card is full nine.

Right it's the hunk Foot Spa. I go in there, it's all guys and one check. And the check is built like me. And if you need a massage, they got like whatever down the street and they got they got all the two types they got all the

time massage Thai, and what's the other one? That's bad to know it's a white new corporation.

Massage Envy. All those places on this block listen, you go get this little Chinese chicken junk for the for the spot, and then give her like a $60 tip.

Because it's 40 for 45 minutes. I give her a $60 tip. She saw me for an hour I leave their fucking busy. Really, she's tremendous. Tremendous. They usually have the one they have the damn fucking happy I got turned on to his bad jujitsu guy. They do the elbow on your back and stuff. I got turned on to this by god i Berto crane, he goes, bro, you. You want the best massage in town I show you and I go I live right across the street. I live right around the corner from it. I could walk there if I want you to go in there some nights I going on date night with my wife. We want to date and we will take sweats. And we switch there and we go and they pull you things they fucking put your feet in the buckets. They rub you down into your shoulders, your neck. Sometimes I don't even I don't want people rubbing my feet. I got that fucking phone guy on the

fucking Chinese hand on my phone. I don't know what the fuck what people? Oh no, I said fuck it. Let me just go. If you are patient zero, what's your patient zero. If they're rubbing your feet, and then it spreads all these people and they have to trace it back. I'm the mother Fuck, I gotta find my toenail. I even got the groom on to get a blowtorch. Feeling as you go up in the valley, and that lady comes. she sticks her thing in the nail and they blow hot. Another lady comes in and they got mask. It's hysterical. And she comes in and we blow it cold there. Like chiropractic crowd therapy type. And the other chick comes with a blowtorch. And they try to blow the fungus away. You got to smell that. You got to smell that.

So I did like six appointments where they tried to burn the fungus off. Oh my god, that doesn't work. The toenail was on fire

doesn't work. Let me show you know it's spread to the other one. So now I got the big one and the one next to it. And he is the ugliest thing in the world. That's like one of those fucking hosts from an eagle.

jujitsu I tried to hide it with a bandaid, but it cuts right through the bandaid. It's horrible. I don't know what else to do. I had to take a medication but I don't know if my kidneys can handle it because the blood pressure medication. Oh, you can't you have to take a fungi thing that's zaps it. But I took one and I tried to zap it and it still didn't kill it. Is there anything you could apply topically or does it have to be a pill they talk I've done everything. I've done everything that happened I'll send the money side to

Clorox I didn't I wrapped it in a fucking Clorox and it's great because I cut it what the best thing I do is I cut it like some nights when I'm bored. I cut it and I take the grinder to it and I grind it into like Coke powder. And it grinds down you have to smell that powder to believe it well. It is so stinky. And I just touching Oh Jesus Christ. And I have to wipe down the counter and throw it away. But I will grind those first two toes it's like a fucking thing

like you're standing your toes

it's sanded I got the extra rock for I had my wife go on Amazon and get like the fucking heart Obama stone. Yeah.

And I just fucking sad that fucking toe nail down. It's funny. I'm gonna tell him

I don't even know. Jesus Christ. I don't know where I got it. It's internal. And oh, it's internal. Yeah, because that's how the fungus is coming out of you. Oh, so it's in your body and it just comes out through your toes so it can come out other spots. Yeah, but I'm not getting it on my nails and nothing like that. It's just on that one phone. I don't know. What if it came on your balls.

Dog This is listen, I'm at the age you don't even know that like no point really want your wife to suck dick.

It's a nightmare.

turtleneck. The nut sack is fucking longer than that. It's a fucking nightmare. I don't know how women could suck it oh man deck is I look at my dick in the mirror. When I got to like the Vegas they got good mirrors. Because you never know. When you went home he looks away does everything because you're used to that

mirror right? It's not that you go away and even walk by your walk past

on a vacation or some when you're on the road working. You walk past a mirror that catches you like I'm getting a little fat. This is like the real hotel mirrors don't fuck around.

But when you look at it at 56 My dick has been through hell. It's got old as you haven't smelled it smells like Newark Staten Island is the pee is different. Have you ever smelled up lately? I'm trying not to I'm when the Ella Machida was saying drink his pizza. Yeah, give him a shot on

this motherfucker, this will poison you. When I wake up in the morning, that first dose of pee is the worst melon thing in the world. Before I go to bed, I drink water a little bit of tight cherry juice. And I take a fucking baby aspirin because the high level after 50 is to get the odd attack between 530 and 12. I was making a mistake of taking that aspirin of seven it's too late. You got bought it. If you take that before you go to sleep. It's better for you. I got to ask you this before we stopped doing this. The before the podcast we were talking about the bedding line for this weekend. Right? Yeah. For Connor and cowboy right. So what were you saying? What are you saying about the over under you guys are both talking about it. You're talking about the over unders like one. One and a half is deals, trying to get people to bed and so what they're doing right now is that what they did they did something spectacular. For starters, when you gamble, you don't gamble on the event. You have to look at what happened the week before. And what's gonna happen the week after that. Now is the prime time if you're a gambler because you have college basketball, pro basketball. You got to action every day, bitch. This is this is when people lose houses. This time of the year is bad. You got football playoffs.

Tonight's the flock and national game that's wearing

what is it college college football tonight's big leg big money big so tonight's big and then we have playoffs are on Saturday. Correct certain on Sunday. We got Conor McGregor so right now, the fucking ESPN to meditate where they just showed con tonight UFC preview as at eight o'clock or six. And they'll show you both training camps and other people on the court or whatnot. Everybody's forcing you to port back Conor McGregor after this weekend. Nobody not even a man Jamie had fucking the Tennessee Titans to beat Baltimore. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody ever been a mother but Baltimore human John Roberts said something for John Rolla say Sam it was like it wasn't gonna happen. Baltimore has been on a hot roll. Baltimore there was another upset to Kansas City that beat the Texans right 2014 They were down 20 For nothing well, you pull up the UFC card for this weekend so I could see was on the card

that's right there's the okay so what

everybody's had me tried to bet Sharon what what's the line that's around right now so you can I get what this is last 262 16 Over Under one and a half rounds

but when I go over one and a half what do I make I make a little more money on the over the under would be the little bit plus plus 105 for under so that I guess the money is on the over right now.

It's minus 135 How can the fucking money be in the overworld pieces slight it's very slight though. Okay, look at this Diego for Hara is the favorite over Anthony Pettis that's interesting fight right there for right there. They know something we don't know. That's interesting. Diego is very good. It's a very good fighter. But Holly home Rachel Pennington. Yeah, that's good fight. Holly home given right. Excuse me. She's a favorite. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Rachel Pennington is tough man. She's very tough painting is one of those checks that like she's had some last second wins like against Ashley Evan Smith, one of the like wild as endings in a female fight. She gets her in a bulldog choke and chokes her unconscious with blood sprang out of her forehead. It was a wild finish, man. See if you could find that finish. Ashley Evan Smith. Raquel Pennington finishes Ashley Evan Smith. So right now what does that look like Donald Cerrone against kind of what's the money look like? I don't understand money line. I don't know. I would. I would be just talking out of my ass. You bet. 100 bucks on cowboy to win and he wins the fight you'd get to 60 So you'd collect 360 And if you bet 100 on Connor, you'd have to bet 320 bucks to win 100 on Connor.

All right, so it's minus 320 The only way you can win this weekend is with Connor

And you see kind of going in and knocking them out in the first round and yonder

would have caught it if fucko wrestles them and it goes five rounds. I don't see a lot of people back and Connor in the Oval kinda looks so good that people are expecting kind of going that this is right. This is Raquel Pennington certified, so just go to like towards the end of it.

It was a wild fight then. And Ashley Evan Smith is the woman who beat Fallon fox that transgender fighter.

She stopped her in her fight right before she came to the UFC. This was just a wild fight Man, these girls were going to war.

So at the very last I mean I think it was like the last second of the fight. She's locking her up in this Bulldog choke and this is why like a blood is spraying out of her head. Oh, they don't show the finish. That's UFC a sneaky like that they don't even see the tap or the knockout like I don't get it guys. I work for you. I love you. Show everybody the choke Why are you hiding the choke? Anyway maybe it's just a time constraint but she got her in this Bulldog choke blood is squirting out of her head and then at the end of the buzzer, she lets go into girls out cold and it was just like whoa, it was one of those fun just whoa like when it's happening you're like holy shit. Now you see something that's just primal this moments in fights that are just primal you know it's sometimes those moments are like they're almost surreal like when Francis and gonna knock down Alistair Overeem boom you're like oh, just primal just what his lip who fucked up oh Rosen strike oh my gosh, I wasn't strikes not gonna fight Francis. Jai Zeno Rosen strike. And Francis in Ghana where?

Columbus Ohio. God damn, that's a crazy fight. Oh, I almost wish more people knew how tough Rosen strike is. You see the fight with Alistair Overeem. And you go well, our store was kind of outpointing him and then he caught outs to slip in really with like 10 seconds left to go on the fight and hit him with a bomb and broke his lip open. That's true. But he's still absorbed. Everything that Astra threw at them did never look like he got shook at all we're talking about a guy and Aleister is knocked out to noodle Santos knocked out. You know, it was the K One Grand Prix champ.

tremendous weight knocked out Todd Duffy and pride knocked out our boys.

He needs your boy they're fucking the Great White hope.

You know what's his name by Clint? Now? He's white hope he's a

Australia. Oh, Brock Lesnar. Right. That's a perfect example of him. But meanwhile, Rosen strike just walked through all that. And I'm not suggesting that the Aleister of today he's had a long career that he says as durable and as big as he was when he fought Brock Lesnar. It's really two different guys at this point. But still rosin striker is a fucking beast. He's so strong man and he's got legit kickboxing skills. What do you see he can fight weekend money? This is what it seems to me. It seems to me that Conor McGregor has an advantage in being able to close the distance. And it may be a speed advantage. This is a perceived thing based on seeing them fight different people. Cowboy when he's at his best is remarkably well rounded. And I think he's more well rounded than Connor. I think cowboy has a lot of tools that people forget about particularly his takedowns are excellent. Cowboy can submit the fuck out of you. He submits a lot of people. He's nasty off his back. He's got wicked triangles. I can see if this went to the ground. Connor getting submitted by cowboy and a triangle. What I couldn't see is cowboy getting submitted by Connor and a triangle. I could see. I can see cowboy submitting Connor I would. I don't think it's impossible for Connor to submit cowboy but I don't see it. I think Connor can win by knockout. Yes, he's very fast. Yeah, his left hand is a fucking piston. And he's sneaky. And he's got nasty uppercuts and he's got a killer instinct when he has you heard he fucking bombs on you. And the idea of Eddie Alvarez fight is the best example that Eddie Alvarez was a world class fighter. And Conor McGregor took it to him like no one has ever done in his career. Tuned him up made him look like he had no business in the in the cage with them. Now for Eddie, he said like he just fought a bad fight and I believe him in the 80s a world class fighter. But the point is, in in go time, Conor McGregor handles pressure is better, as much or better, as good as well or better than anyone who's ever lived. He handles pressure so well. Kisses Floyd Mayweather with an

uppercut in a fight where he's so outclassed. He has zero boxing matches and he's fighting the greatest boxer of all time. And one of the biggest Pay Per View cards ever. It's nuts, right so he can handle pressure. He lost that fight because Floyd is a way better boxer. But he handled the pressure. Pressure against Aldo talked so much shit for a year going on tour together 10 pictures of him stealing his belt gets in front of them. flatlines and then 13 seconds, perfect punch perfect execution, like measures him with one left hand before that steps back. He dives in with the left bank catches them coming in. It's perfect. Under Pressure. He's not the kind of grappler that Nirma med office. He's not in that category. We have pressure on this fight. Oh, he's got so much pressure. He fought he fought the guy who everyone's terrified of and at least he made it into the fourth round right wasn't a fourth round submission. And he probably wasn't really prepared for that fight. Think about how much time he had been offered MMA how much time he'd been working on, you know, just boxing and then spending all that money because he made like $100 million.

The question for me is, who is Conor right now is Conor McGregor the same guy that knocked out Dustin Dustin puoi when he was a savage? Is he the same guy that knocked out Diego Brandao? Is he is is he the same guy that knocked out Josie Aldo Is he the same guy who knocked out Eddie Alvarez or is he just some new thing? Because all this money and all this fame and all this attention loves to party and what does he now

if he's the same guy in it physically, there should be no reason why he isn't he hasn't taken a terrible beatings, even the never gonna fight he stopped him with a choke.

If he is the same guy physically and he decides he wants to let the fucking world know that he can still do it and who gives a fuck how much money he has in the bank. He wants to let the world know he's here to fuck people up. And he's here to reclaim his crowd if he goes into the fight with that attitude.

I mean, we could certainly see a resurgence The question has always been whether or not a rich man has the motivation to work like a poor man. And he's a very rich man. We all know everybody's different. Mayweather fought hard to the day he died. Or excuse me till the day he retired. And Mayweather when he was during his career was rich, like from like, a couple of years and he was rich. He was rich. So he was always rich and still fought like the best of the world and still trained like you have to train to be the best and what type of gaps was he taken in between fights guys? This has been a long gap before No it's not Yeah, before no maca mega off it was a long gap you know it's true the game has evolved a lot you know in a real world I get what you heard me telling Jamie was basically this in a real world

you know Sharon once we got the last five fights he's had to gauge had some ups and downs ups and lost the gauge he lost two miles Vidal

lost real bad Darren till the dare until one was a bad so either the last five fights is two and three is what you lost Tony Ferguson

beat out i Quinta though and looked real fucking good doing it. So he's lost to the game he fight.

And he beat my parent, which was a really good fight for him. Because Mike Perry is big scary guy throws bombs. So beat him. Last Leon Edwards. I think he was sick coming into that fight but you know, lost either way. And beat Yancey Madera. So why am I saying that in the real world? He should take him out people looking at them. I don't think there's going to be that easy of a fight. I like it. I like the over. I love the over. I don't I can't pick a side yet. Yeah, but I love the Oh, I could see everybody back in McGregor when round one. And something crazy happen. I mean, in a perfect world. You know, maybe his chin has been a little suspect lately, Donald? I don't know. I don't think so. I think he's just been fighting werewolves. has been fighting the toughest guys in the world. Look, everybody's chin suspect if Darren tail is smashing your fucking nose open with an elbow. That dude's an animal and he's big as fuck. When Dan tell fought cowboy, he's so much bigger than him. There was a difference between a really big welterweight and a guy who came up from lightweight. Dan tells a giant dude, I mean, he's nicknamed the gorilla. So here we go. Yeah, he beat I quit. Beat Alexander Hernandez. That was a fantastic fight. That was a fantastic fight because that right this kid Hernandez is a young tough guy was talking mad shit. But there's a giant difference between a no diss

Respect to Hernandez and Conor McGregor. Yes, Conor McGregor is used to those bright lights man, he shines, he shines as bright lights. To me the question is really just whether or not he has the motivation to train and fight like a fucking madman again, like he did when he was younger when he was smashing people and for cowboy. It's whether or not he can survive the early storm. I think getting his leg kicks working would be very big, because Connor likes to take that long stance kind of takes that long stance and he fights right leg forward. He fights southpaw. And if Donald can fuck up that right leg, they can figure out a way to attack that right leg, knees, the body coming in. It's gotta avoid the punches though. Yep, he's up there with Who do I say he's with? He's with Sergio Pettis coach up there. He's training. Yeah, he said do Rufus Rufus sport. If he's a walking sport for this camp. They're probably working on a lot of kickboxing. But I guarantee we'll lose will lead me doing some wrestling takedown because he knows that's where the money is when he has a big fight coming up. Well, he's gonna fight Leon Edwards and Leon Edwards is a dangerous man. It's like that's a that's a big fight. And Leon Edwards, for whatever reason, is not known as much as he is skillful. You know, he beat cowboy, like you said, and he's the guy that gotten that crazy brawl with mods with all backstage bows with all hidden with the two peas in the soda.

But that's that guy's a tough, tough, tough guy, super highly skilled guy. And Leon Edwards and Tyron Woodley, that's a very high stakes fight that a lot of people aren't talking about, like that's the fight for the number one contender, because if Tyrion emerged, or if Leon emerges, and it's in it's a big fight, and in the fight goes, well, that person is almost certainly at least considered other than Mozza Vidal, who's the fan favorite? And then the rematch. Those are those are the two possibilities to read the rematch with Kobe and Guzman. Other than that, you want to see, you want to see the winner of Tyron Woodley and Leon Edwards. It just makes sense. Makes sense that that would be the next one or Mossville. Those Those that's how I would look at it. I would look at it that way. I would look at it like there's

there's a lot of options. There's a lot of options for that division. And now Connor is talking about fighting Guzman. That would be bonkers. So if Connor beats cowboy and decides he feels great at this weight, he feels confident now and dedicated he wants to make a run at the fucking champ. There's a big size difference between Guzman and Connor Huisman is a big person he's got a thick 170 Guys a bay that big copies a big fella that copies a big filament big tell so his fucking monster the Dow big 170 Yep, that's somebody else at 170 That's deceiving as fuck too. I think Mazda was in the sweet spot. He's not too big, whereas to kill himself to make the way but he's he can obviously knock out Welterweights easily. He's knocked out a lot of welterweights. I mean, the the Ben Astron one is fucking preposterous, but of course just even the beating that he's putting on Nate Diaz Matsudo can fuck people up at 170 I, I think him versus Connor would be insane. You fucked me up, dawg. You fucked me up by not bringing them back. The runway has taken them fuck me up. Well, I called you that month that you were telling me this I got the random and put them up at the combine for a week. You know, I went down a foxhole his fights. Oh, he was amazing. About a month ago. Just that whole era. Yeah, I've been turning people on just tell that whole life where the dad was. We were talking about

because I got pissed off with that fucking big round thing because he said he came to the United States on the pretension that he had won three national yoga competitions in India. And I'm not that stupid. I grew up on Wide World of Sports. i We learned everything on why World Sports I saw a dude catch a bullet with his mouth on Aaron bankss tournament. Aaron banks karate tournament. Yeah, really. He in New York City haven't been caught a bull with his teeth. Aaron banks higher there was a dude who that's what he was known for. It's on YouTube. Is that real? I don't know how

Joey, he they put a glass in front of the guy. So both goes through the glass. The two. He put a special mouthpiece on and they shoot and then How close was the glass? Watch. Let me go pee real quick. You play that for me. Give me some volume.

But there's one from one.

Okay, so it's just music. That's all right. So the guy's name is

Ralph. I see it. Well, this is supposed to be the video I thought. What's happening here? Maybe not as price shown in slo mo. But there's got to be like someone who's Snopes is this. I believe Penn and Teller do it you

Now

they do it. Yeah, they touch a bullet in their teeth. Well, pen would be the first one to tell you it's bullshit.

I mean, that's

half of their stick. I should probably get him back in here. Have him explain how the fuck somebody catches a bolt in their teeth. There's no bullshit might not be the way to do it. But there's a way to do it that safer than actually shooting or shooting a gun at your teeth. I think I don't think they shoot a gun at your teeth. Because I don't think you can do that a whole lot of times. See if a guy's doing that. It's not it's doing it. I think I can do it that Okay, give it a shot. It's on. Now he's done it before, right? He's doing his bullet thing in front of people. I would assume that's not the first and only time he's catching a bullet in his teeth. David Blaine did it too. Right? You listen to me? Yeah, that means you have to practice how many times you're gonna lose. Let it dude shoot you in the face. How are you practicing that? That's not real. David Blaine did it with a metal cup in his mouth. Oh, wow. So the metal cup caught the bullet and other guy wore I think this guy that Joey watched had steel dentures. Oh my god. You have you had steel dentures if someone's gonna shoot you in the face. And you gotta make sure that they don't hit your lips. Do you know how hard it is and not hit someone? How close do you have to be? Do you where you're with a pistol? Is that what they use? And you can absolutely sure they're 57 Jesus, there's no way that can't be real. One person died doing it. Of course they should be willing to the most famous person to die we're doing the trick always performed silently, because he apparently spoke no English. When his final performance of the trick went wrong. And he was accidentally shot in the chest. He exclaimed in perfect English. Oh my god, something's happened. Lower the curtain at his autopsy was discovered that he was not Chinese, but an American named William Robinson. But that's a story for another day.

So we're

talking about a guy who was his scam was he we let people shoot him and he catch the boat in his teeth. And it was Chung Ling Soo and he pretended he was Chinese but then he accidentally got shot in the chest. The guy didn't shoot him in the mouth shot him in the chest instead. And he as he drops down he said oh my god, something's happened lower the curtain and perfect English. So the autopsy revealed that he was not Chinese but an American named William Robinson.

Can't do that today cultural appropriation. But even back then. That's a hilarious way to die.

was just one of the guys that was catching bullets with his teeth. It was a couple of fucking lunatics. So that's how I knew I grew up on why bullet sports. They showed you everything. But I got caught in a foxhole. They had Hagler

Haglund Rafi Ooh, Gabi was amazed. Because in those days, they used to do a pay per view on Saturday. And then you had to wait a week. Yeah, for Saturday, Sunday. So no next next out of the fall on Saturday be on Wide World of Sports if you could hold on but I still remember dog being a fucking kid on a Saturday. And watching Doom come Kim and man Seanie walked out of each other because that was live.

Was IBC barbell sports Absolutely.

cooked him that was the reason why they changed the the round number from 15 down to 12. After that guy died. What was that again? This was the season. Oh, yes, Vegas, Nevada. It looks like it's outside, doesn't it?

Yeah, it is outside outside? Yeah.

That's crazy. Tim Ryan you just had to be January or February of 83. Dude, this is crazy. Number 82 like two months before that November of 82 Man Seanie was an animal man when he fought Alexis agua I think that's this right he says he's the Korean guy do come can go rest his soul wrote on a piece of wood before he went out to fight and kill or be killed. Yeah, that guy was a tough motherfucker Ray Boom Boom Manzini. But the tough motherfucker, this was 1979 he was 21 years old. This is the duck who can fight. So imagine he killed somebody when he was 21 years old at a fight that is hardcore man. That's a hard pill to swallow. What was the probably both things and then also probably probably had to make weight. A lot of deaths in boxing apparently happened in the lower weight classes. And then one of the reasons is that when these guys actually enter into fights, a lot of times they're still dehydrated, they would dehydrate themselves pretty bad in the weigh ins to get to whatever weight class it was like 134, but he probably weighs, you know, 134 and a quarter is what he weighed in. He probably walks around like 150 ish or something like that. And they dehydrate themselves and it's very difficult to rehydrate the brain apparently, it's not as quick and easy as it is rehydrating the body and even that takes some time. So most of the deaths

kickboxing have occurred most of them is still very dangerous even for the heavyweight division there was a guy went into a coma Russian guy in a fight a few years back.

But in the lighter weight divisions, they think it's generally when people get more, more more likely to die from fights, and they think it might have something to do with cutting weight. But it's also like, you know, really skillful people punching each other in the head. The Jarrell McClellan fight is a good example that they always point to because Jeremy McClellan, who was just a straight up murder, when he was a light heavyweight, really struggled to make weight man real bad. And in one fight, with Nigel Benn, Nigel Benn got off the deck, and it looked like he was out and made it back into the ring, fight his ass off and then started taking it to Gerald, but this didn't come on camera here again. Yeah, and that was the end of the fight. After Ray Manzini stopped him everybody's all happy. And then the guy slides into a coma.

Winds up dying. So he's sitting there like so he's, he's really battered.

They think again, I think it might have something to do with cutting weight.

It's a fucking horrible, horrible way to go man.

But Kill or be killed. That's what he signed up for. actually wrote before he went out there to fight. I mean, he fought that way too. You know what I saw recently, it was one of the wildest fights. Roberto Duran is Sugar Ray Leonard one. Holy shit, is it wow. Oh my god. I just watched

I think yeah, the rock Toronto was the first one. Louisiana was the second one. Ontario Malta Ontario. Yeah, that's a good one. Those are much I was the first one. Yeah, gotcha. Really good. God. Damn, it was a really good one. It was cold. Crazy. Peanut quiet was crazy fights on that these guys were so fast. Both Leonard and Duran were so fast back then. And Leonard was just I mean, he was America's darling Olympic gold medalists, handsome sweetheart of a guy and Roberto Duran was a straight up savage who was sponsored by cigarette company. Look at that. He's got a cigarette company logo on his back. That was a cigarette company was it looks like Marlboro. I think he had a cigarette company sponsor him. But either way, maybe maybe it was just a design. He was a monster. And he just jumped on top of Sugar Ray Leonard and wouldn't let him breathe and sugar eight decided to try to fight his fight. square it up to the fight. square it up a little to the fight sugar rageous decided to try to engage him like up close like this. So they fought these kinds of fights like this in the clinch total fucking chaos kind of fighting which favors Duran Duran was just relentless. That's wild animal that shit. But see how he's like wrestling with them and fucking under under hooking them and pushing them against the rank staying in his face. He's not giving him any chance to move and have the rematch. Obviously sugar I fought a totally different fight and got Roberto Duran to quit.

But it was an amazing fight. And historically, like one of the greatest boxing matches ever just chaos as Sugar Ray Leonard taking a chance and you know, his ego probably got the better of them said I'm gonna beat you at your own game or try to it. And Durant just stuck to him like glue and just ripped out his body and stayed on him. And then after it's over, sure, Duran still pushed him away. He's like, get the fuck away from me. Like after the fight was over Duran was still mad at him.

Great man dread movement. It was a Montreal it was in Canada because a couple of days before the fight Durant bumped into Sugar Ray Leonard and Sugar Ray Being the nice guy that he is had his wife

and his kids. And he goes Come on. Let's go over and say hello to Bernie because Roberto como estar. And Roberto as I get the fuck out of my face before I fuck your wife and he has read the book, the book, I read the book, I got into sugar race head so badly that that was how he beat him. He said that to me. I'm gonna fuck your wife in the air. So see ya. Look, he comes running back out and pushes and wants to

look at the fuck away from me.

The animal still screaming at him. Fuck you screaming at him after a war. Duran Batum Duran was a monster he was so angry look at him bro even after all that fighting still.

Same finger Yeah, King savage. He was an intelligent savage. Like a savage technician. You know his boxing was so beautiful. Duran was like he was he just knew how to nullify you take away out and put his will on you, man animal. All right, he's still gotta wrap this up. Joey on another podcast. I got to do I love you, brother. I love you very much. I won't see you this week. What I'm gonna see again, Tuesday tomorrow.
