SHOOTING DRAFT

1949



Interior: Jack Burden's Desk, The Chronicle, Day

Jack Burden is looking over the morning edition of "The 
Chronicle." He reads the society page. A man enters and leans 
across his desk.

MAN
Burden! Jack Burden! The boss wants 
to see you.

He folds his paper, rises, and walks by the presses into 
Madison's office.

Interior: Madison's Office, Day

Madison, the city editor, is correcting copy at his desk.

MADISON
Hey, Jack, ever hear of a fellow 
called Willie Stark?

JACK
No. Who'd he shoot?

MADISON
Oh, county... uh... treasurer, or 
something like that.

JACK
What's so special about him?

MADISON
They say he's an honest man. What I 
want you to do is to hop into your 
car...

JACK
Why, you promised me a vacation.

MADISON
Well, that can wait.

JACK
Yeah... but there's a... a girl I 
know.

He opens his newspaper to the society page and shows Madison 
a photograph of Anne Stanton.

MADISON
Oh... Well, she can wait too.

Jack takes the paper back and looks at it.

JACK
The question is... can I?

MADISON
The answer is... get up there.

JACK
Right.
(starts to go)
Oh... uh... what did you say his 
name was?

MADISON
Who?

JACK
The fellow's name.

MADISON
Oh, the... uh... Stark... Willie 
Stark.

Madison goes on with his work.

JACK
(as he leaves)
Willie Stark...

DISSOLVE TO:

Exterior: Kanoma City, Day

As Jack Burden's jalopy pulls up before the Kanoma County 
Courthouse of this back-country, one-street small town.

JACK
(voice over)
I found him in Kanoma City. A typical, 
hot, dusty, backwoods county seat.

He gets out of the car, and notices a crowd of people gathered 
around a platform in the town square. As he walks over the 
begins to hear the words that Willie Stark is speaking.

WILLIE
...to lie to them in order to line 
their own dirty pockets with the 
taxpayers' money. When have the 
citizens of Kanoma County ever 
witnessed a campaign like this? Why 
is the opposition so anxious to defeat 
me? Why have they used every dirty 
method known to make sure I'm not 
elected county treasurer? Well, I'll 
tell you why...

A man in shirt sleeves and suspenders, Tiny Duffy, comes out 
of the local poolroom, listens for a moment to Willie's 
speech, and signals to two uniformed men to go over and break 
up the gathering.

Jack Burden stands close to the platform, next to Willie's 
son, Tom, who waits patiently to distribute handbills.

WILLIE
...Because they're afraid of the 
truth... and the truth is this. 
They're trying to steal your money. 
Yeah, I said steal. The county 
commissioners rejected the bid on 
the schoolhouse. Why? Well, they'll 
tell you their reason is the job 
will be done better. The county 
commissioners would have you believe 
that they're interested in public 
welfare. They're interested in 
welfare, sure. But it's their own. 
Let's look at the reason in the light 
of the facts and the figures. That 
brick factory is owned by one of the 
commissioners. That same brick factory 
uses convict labor.

The sheriff and his deputy push through the crowd.

SHERIFF
Sorry, Willie, you'll have to move 
on.

WILLIE
Why?

SHERIFF
City Ordinance Number One-Oh-Five: 
more than five people congregating 
is disturbing the peace.

WILLIE
(ignores him)
If you folks'll be so kind as to 
read these handbills, my boy will 
pass them out among you.

SHERIFF
There's an ordinance against that 
too.

WILLIE
(his face grim)
Pass 'em out, Tom.

The sheriff pushes Tom back, grabbing the handbills out of 
his hand. Willie jumps down off the platform.

WILLIE
Let him alone!

The sheriff collars Willie, then notices Jack on the platform 
snapping a picture.

SHERIFF
(to deputy)
Get that camera! Willie, you're under 
arrest.

He takes Willie by the arm and leads him away. The crowd 
follows them to the courthouse. Tiny Duffy wipes the sweat 
off his neck and goes back into the poolroom.

DISSOLVE TO:

Interior: Kanoma City Poolroom, Day

Two of Duffy's men, Pillsbury and a local commissioner, are 
playing pool as Jack enters.

JACK
Where can I find Tiny Duffy?

PILLSBURY
Right over there, mister.

He walks over to Duffy. Some townspeople, who followed him 
there, gather around him to listen.

JACK
Uh, they told me I could get my camera 
back here.

DUFFY
Who told you that?

JACK
People. Can I?

DUFFY
You the reporter that's been snoopin' 
around town?

JACK
Are you Tiny Duffy?

DUFFY
What paper?

JACK
Chronicle.

DUFFY
You sure come a long way to stick 
your nose into other people's 
business.

JACK
That's true... Only my boss on the 
paper can't see it that way.

DUFFY
It ain't any of his business either.

JACK
Whose business is it?

PILLSBURY
Them as is tendin' to it. County 
commissioners that the voters of 
Kanoma County elected to tend to 
their business and not take no buttin' 
in from nobody.

JACK
You a commissioner?

PILLSBURY
Yeah. Name's Pillsbury. Dolph 
Pillsbury.

2ND COMMISSIONER
Me too. I'm a commissioner too.

JACK
Who isn't a commissioner?

DUFFY
He's the head man.

JACK
(to Pillsbury)
Then you're in a position to know 
where --

DUFFY
He's in a position to know nothin'. 
And to say nothin'.

JACK
I thought you said he was head man?

DUFFY
(smiling)
He uses my head.

PILLSBURY
(laughing loudly)
Oh, Tiny, you're a card... Ain't he 
a card? Yeah, he's a card... Now, 
who thought up those city ordinances 
about arresting someone for making a 
speech?

DUFFY
Who's arrested? Nobody's been 
arrested.
(looks toward the 
door)
Hi, Willie.

Willie enters, accompanied by the sheriff and his deputy. 
The others in the room, including Sugar Boy in his bartender's 
apron, step aside to let him pass through.

PILLSBURY
Hi, Willie.

DUFFY
(to Sheriff)
Did you apologize to Willie?

SHERIFF
(mumbles)
Yeah, I apologized to Willie.

DUFFY
Did you give him his handbills back?

SHERIFF
Yeah, I gave 'em back.

DUFFY
Give him back his flag and his bag 
and...
(points to Jack)
give this man his camera.

WILLIE
I'm going to be on that same street 
corner tomorrow, Mr. Duffy.

DUFFY
You go right ahead, Willie. We all 
believe in free speech. We got to... 
it's in the Constitution.

WILLIE
My boy is out distributing those 
handbills now.

DUFFY
It's a free country, Willie. If you 
can convince the people to vote for 
you... you go right ahead.

WILLIE
What did you want to see me about, 
Mr. Duffy?

DUFFY
I wanted you to meet a fella came 
all the way up from the state capital 
to meet you. A reporter. Wants to 
write you up... maybe put your picture 
in the paper.

WILLIE
(turns to Jack)
I'm happy to know you, sir.

JACK
Burden's my name... Jack Burden. Can 
we go somewhere where we can talk?

DUFFY
Now that ain't polite. Don't you 
want to hear both sides of the story?

Jack examines the camera that has just been returned to him.

JACK
I know your side.
(finds the plate 
missing)
What happened to the plate your men 
took from my camera?

DUFFY
Must have dropped out. Oh, come on, 
fellas, let's relax. It's a hot day... 
Hey, Sugar Boy...

SUGAR BOY
Yeah?

DUFFY
Bring some cold beer for the boys.

WILLIE
None for me, thank you kindly.

PILLSBURY
Now you know Willie don't drink, 
Tiny. His wife don't favor drinking. 
And Willie's the teacher's pet, ain't 
you, Willie?

WILLIE
I'll have some orange pop if you 
don't mind.

Duffy roars with laughter.

DUFFY
Orange pop! All right, Sugar Boy. 
Bring him some orange pop.

SUGAR BOY
(stutters)
Th-th-the p-p-pop's s-s-sold out.

DUFFY
Did you hear that, boys? The p-p-
pop's s-s-sold out.

They all laugh.

PILLSBURY
Now ain't he a card?

WILLIE
(his face hard)
He stutters, Mr. Duffy, but you... 
you don't say anything.
(to Jack)
Let's go, mister.

They turn and go out.

DISSOLVE TO:

Exterior: Dirt Road, Day

Jack is driving Willie home to his farmhouse. They pass a 
farmer and his family walking by the side of the road. Willie 
smiles and waves to them.

Exterior: Stark Farmhouse, Day

As the car pulls into the drive we see Pa Stark in his rocking 
chair on the porch, and Lucy, who stands at the top of the 
steps, waiting to welcome Willie.

WILLIE
(as they go up the 
steps)
This is my wife, Lucy, Mr. Burden.

JACK AND LUCY
How do you do?

WILLIE
That's my pa.

Jack reaches out to shake his hand.

DISSOLVE TO:

Interior: Stark Farmhouse, Night

Willie finishes chewing his food, pats his mouth with a 
napkin, and pushes his plate back.

WILLIE
Now we'll talk.

Camera pulls back to include Jack, Lucy, and Pa, all seated 
around the dinner table.

JACK
You've been talking for a long time, 
Mr. Stark.

PAPPY
Willie's got a lot to say.

LUCY
You sleepy, Pappy? You want to have 
a nap?

PAPPY
No, I want to hear it.

Lucy gets up and turns on a light in the kitchen.

LUCY
I'm worried about Tom. It's getting 
dark. He should have been home.

WILLIE
He's a strong boy. Don't worry about 
him. He can take care of himself.

JACK
How old is the boy?

WILLIE
Fifteen.

JACK
How long have you been married?

WILLIE
Nine years.

Willie grins at Jack's look of surprise. Lucy comes back 
into the room.

LUCY
(laughs)
He was a neighbor's boy. They were 
poor folks. Both died. I couldn't 
have any children, so... He's a good 
boy.

WILLIE
Oh, he's the best. I couldn't love 
him any more if he was my own flesh 
and blood.

JACK
(to Lucy)
And now you, Mrs. Stark?

LUCY
Oh, there isn't very much to tell 
about me.

JACK
How did you meet?

LUCY
I was teaching school and one day a 
pupil walked in. It was Willie. I 
couldn't have a grown man in the 
class and Willie wanted to learn so 
badly... so I married him.

JACK
Is that the only reason?

LUCY
(pressing Willie's 
arm)
Except that I loved him.

WILLIE
Get the coffee, Lucy.

She goes back into the kitchen.

JACK
When did they fire you, Mrs. Stark?

LUCY
(as she serves the 
coffee)
A couple of weeks ago. I'd been 
teaching for a long time and nobody 
ever said I wasn't all right. But I 
don't care. I don't want to teach in 
a schoolhouse that they built just 
so somebody can steal some money. 
And Willie doesn't want to be 
Treasurer, either, if he has to 
associate with those dishonest people.

WILLIE
(glumly)
I'm going to run. They can't keep me 
from running.

JACK
If you don't mind the truth, Mr. 
Stark, you haven't much of a chance.

WILLIE
I'm going to run. They're not going 
to kick me around like I was dirt.

LUCY
I don't care if Willie loses... just 
so he gets the truth to the people. 
Isn't that true, Willie?

Willie is silent. Jack looks at him.

LUCY
Isn't it, Willie?

WILLIE
Hmmm?... Yeah, yeah, sure, that's 
right.

LUCY
Well, if you lose you can give a 
little more time to studying your 
law books.

JACK
Oh, you studying law too?

WILLIE
By myself, at night.

PAPPY
Willie's a smart boy.

WILLIE
If I ever find the time I'm going to 
take a course at the university.

The door opens slowly and Tom comes in from the porch. His 
clothes are torn and his face is dirty and bloody. He still 
carries some of the handbills. They rise to their feet and 
cluster around him.

LUCY
What happened, Tommy boy? What's the 
matter?

TOM
(head down, muttering)
I gave out the handbills, Pa.

WILLIE
Speak up. Speak up.

LUCY
Let him tell it his own way. Go on, 
Tommy.

TOM
This time they were waiting for me. 
They took them away from me. Threw 
them in the dirt and beat me up. I 
brought some of them back.

WILLIE
(pats him on the back)
Good boy. Have you eaten yet, Tom?

LUCY
Let him wash up first.

As Tom and Pappy go into the other room, a rock comes crashing 
through the front window, shattering the glass. Willie, his 
face filled with anger, throws open the door and stalks out 
onto the porch. Jack stands at the door, watching Willie 
shout into the darkness around him.

WILLIE
I'm going to run... and you're not 
going to stop me. I'm gonna run even 
if I don't get a single vote.

FADE OUT

FADE IN:

Interior: Jack Burden's Desk, Day

Jack's fingers type out a story, the last line of which reads 
"an honest man with courage." He pulls the sheet out and 
hands it to Madison.

JACK
Here you are... the last of the Willie 
Stark articles. Now can I go?

MADISON
Yes. You've earned your vacation. 
You've been writing these like you 
really mean them.

Jack rises and walks toward the door.

JACK
I do.

DISSOLVE TO:

Exterior: Ferry To Burden's Landing, Day

Jack's car is ferried across the bay to the slip of Burden's 
Landing.

JACK
(voice over)
I hadn't been home in a long time. 
Only a hundred and thirty miles from 
Kanoma City. It was separated from 
the mainland by a body of water. For 
the first time I wondered if it wasn't 
separated by more than that.

DISSOLVE TO:

Exterior: Mrs. Burden's Home, Day

As Jack arrives, Mrs. Burden and her husband, McEvoy, are 
seated at a lawn table near the boat landing.

JACK
Hello, Mother.

She runs forward to meet him.

MRS. BURDEN
Floyd, Jack's home. Oh, he looks 
fine... doesn't he look fine?
(to Jack, coquettishly)
How do I look, Jackie boy?

JACK
You look beautiful, Mother.

MRS. BURDEN
I've got so many things planned for 
you... parties and... it'll be just 
like old times. But first, let's 
have a drink.

MCEVOY
Can't that wait until this evening?

She goes ahead and pours the drinks.

MRS. BURDEN
Floyd... honey... my son's home.

MCEVOY
How long do you plan on staying?

JACK
(coldly)
Two or three weeks. If that's all 
right with you.

MRS. BURDEN
I'm sure your father would be --

JACK
Stepfather, Mother.

MRS. BURDEN
(reproachfully)
Now, Jackie... here we all are. Floyd, 
Jackie, myself.
(raises her glass for 
a toast)
To the best time we've ever had 
together.

JACK
Yes, Mother.

They drink. Mrs. Burden gulps hers down avidly. Jack looks 
at her and then at McEvoy.

JACK
Excuse me... I...

He turns and walks back toward the shore. He boards a small 
motorboat and heads toward a house that can be seen across 
the water.

DISSOLVE TO:

Exterior: Stanton Home (Burden's Landing), Day

As the boat approaches the shore. Adam Stanton reaches down 
and pulls the boat up on land. He throws his arm around Jack, 
and the two climb the hill toward Judge Stanton, who stands 
waiting to greet him.

JACK
Dr. Stanton, I presume.

STANTON
(laughing)
Is my shingle showing?

JUDGE
Good to see you, boy. Very good.

JACK
Good to see you, Judge. How have you 
been? What have you been doing?

They walk back together to the patio tables.

JUDGE
Oh, just sitting here... waiting for 
all of you to come home. You know, 
when a man starts to get old his 
eyes stray and play funny tricks on 
him. As I watched you in that boat I 
thought sure I saw a boy of twelve 
with a fishing rod in his hands. And 
I was sure the first thing he'd say 
would be...

Jack catches sight of Anne Stanton walking down the path. He 
runs to meet her. As they embrace, he looks back at the Judge.

JACK
Do you mind if I kiss your niece, 
sir?

He kisses her, and they turn and walk away.

DISSOLVE TO:

Exterior: Tennis Court (Burden's Landing), Day

Anne gracefully returns a ball to Jack, then runs to embrace 
him at the net. Adam, seated near the court, smiles 
approvingly.

DISSOLVE TO:

Exterior: Gulf (Burden's Landing), Morning

Jack and Judge Stanton in a rowboat, on their way to do some 
duck hunting.

DISSOLVE TO:

Exterior: Gulf (Burden's Landing), Day

Adam is at the wheel of his sailboat, with Jack and Anne 
behind him.

DISSOLVE TO:

Interior: Stanton Living Room (Burden's Landing), Night

A party in the Stanton living room. Adam plays the piano. He 
plays a waltz. Jack and Anne hold each other tightly as they 
move among the other couples.

DISSOLVE TO:

Interior: Burden Dining Room, Night

A formal dinner, attended by Jack and Anne, Mrs. Burden and 
McEvoy, Judge Stanton and Adam. Mrs. Burden is proposing a 
toast.

MRS. BURDEN
To all the good times we've had 
together at Burden's Landing. And 
especially to this one. Because my 
son's home.

JACK
Thank you, Mother. Thank you very 
much.

MRS. BURDEN
Monty, Anne and I have been discussing 
Jack's career. What do you think he 
ought to go in for? Shall he be a 
lawyer, doctor...

Jack looks at Anne.

ANNE
We were just discussing whether you 
should...

JACK
(to his mother)
I like what I'm doing, Mother.

MCEVOY
You do very well at it. I read your 
articles about this fellow... Willie 
Stark. Very convincing... Too 
convincing for my tastes.

JACK
A lot of people like them.

MCEVOY
A lot of people are fools. Articles 
like that shouldn't be permitted. 
They only tend to incite people.

JACK
What are you afraid of?

STANTON
I thought they were very good. I was 
proud of you, Jack. I was particularly 
interested in Stark's ideas on health 
and medicine. You know the conditions 
at the hospital I work in. They're 
intolerable. I'd like to meet this 
Willie Stark. He sounds like an honest 
man.

MCEVOY
Honest man? This state is full of 
these log-cabin Abe Lincolns with 
price tags on them. The louder he 
yells the higher his price.

JACK
You think you can buy anything, don't 
you?

MCEVOY
Yes, don't you?

There is a silence. Then McEvoy turns to the Judge.

MCEVOY
What do you think, Judge?

JUDGE
I think this state could stand a few 
changes.

MCEVOY
(his face white)
Well, I'll tell you what I think --

ANNE
(quickly)
Oh, please... let's not talk politics.

MRS. BURDEN
Anne is right. I absolutely forbid 
any more of it. I know what we need, 
we need another toast.
(to the Judge)
You propose it, Monty... you're so 
good at it.

The Judge picks up his glass and stands up.

JUDGE
To the young people... to Anne, to 
Jack, to Adam... To what lies before 
them. To the world they'll make... 
in spite of the mistakes we've made.

MCEVOY
(rising)
The mistakes you've made, not me. 
You're all still pretty high and 
mighty, aren't you? You all think 
this state needs a change. You don't 
like the way it's run. Well, who's 
going to run it? Willie Stark? The 
Judge?
(to Jack)
You? You can be bought too. As a 
matter of fact you have been. And 
with my money.

Jack's answer is to throw his liquor in his stepfather's 
face. There is a pause. McEvoy wipes the liquor off with his 
handkerchief.

MCEVOY
(slowly)
That's a waste of good liquor.
(looks at Mrs. Burden)
Your mother wouldn't approve.

Jack turns and leaves the room.

MRS. BURDEN
Jack...

She hurries after him.

Exterior: Veranda, Night

As Mrs. Burden comes out after Jack. Anne stands in the 
doorway.

MRS. BURDEN
Jack... you go back in and apologize.

JACK
Apologize? I'd rather die.

MRS. BURDEN
I've got to live with him.

JACK
Well, I don't. Neither do you. You 
don't love him, Mother. You never 
did.

MRS. BURDEN
Son, don't spoil anything now... He 
can help you.

JACK
I can get along without him. You 
need this house. And the parties. 
And the cars and the clothes and the 
lies. I don't. It's the truth, Mother, 
face it. For once in your life, face 
it.

Mrs. Burden appeals to Anne.

MRS. BURDEN
Anne, please... please make him 
understand.

Anne says nothing. Mrs. Burden goes back into the house.

DISSOLVE TO:

Interior: Stanton Living Room, Night

Anne and Jack sit alone in the room, beneath the portrait of 
the old Governor Stanton.

JACK
Anne, Burden's Landing is a place on 
the moon. It isn't real. It doesn't 
exist. It's me pretending I live on 
what I earn. It's my mother trying 
to keep herself young, and drinking 
herself old doing it. It's you and 
Adam living in this house as though 
your father were still alive. It's 
an old man like the Judge dreaming 
of the past... Anne, come away with 
me.

ANNE
And do what?

JACK
(rises impatiently)
And live in a shack and eat red beans. 
Anne, what do you want me to do?

ANNE
Oh, Jack, Jack, you haven't been 
sure. You've gone from one thing to 
the other... a year at law school, 
and now this job as a reporter...

JACK
Are you afraid I can't make a living?

ANNE
Oh, no, Jack, it isn't that. I don't 
care about the money. It... it's 
just that I... I want you to be 
something.

JACK
What is it you want me to be?

ANNE
I don't know. It's just that I want 
you to be... to do... something 
important.

Jack looks up at the portrait of Governor Stanton.

JACK
Like your father. All right. I'll 
run for governor.
(pause)
Anne, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I said 
that.

ANNE
All right, Jack. I'll go away with 
you. I'll do anything you want me to 
do.

They kiss.

JACK
Anne, I've wanted you to say that 
more than anything in the world, and 
now that you've said it... Anne, I 
guess you were right. I'm not sure 
of anything, including myself. I'm 
not sure I could live up to the...
(looks again at the 
portrait)
Anne, wait for me. Please wait for 
me.

ANNE
I'll wait for you.

DISSOLVE TO:

Interior: Madison's Office, Day

Madison is at his desk as Jack enters.

MADISON
Hello, Jack. Cut your vacation short, 
didn't you?

JACK
Yeah.

MADISON
By the way, Jack, the fellow you 
wrote the articles about... uh... 
Stark.

JACK
Yeah?

MADISON
He lost.

JACK
Well, I guess that's the end of Willie 
Stark.

He turns around and walks off toward his desk.

FADE OUT

FADE IN:

Interior: Stark Farmhouse, Night

Lucy and Willie are seated together at the table. Willie has 
his law books open before him.

WILLIE
...Measure of the damages is caused 
by...

LUCY
(prompting)
A breach...

WILLIE
A breach...

LUCY

The whole town is there. Willie Stark, Lucy, Tom stand 
modestly in the background. Quiet sobbing is heard as the 
minister reads from the Bible. When he finishes the prayer, 
he walks past the line of mourners, shaking their hands. The 
ceremony is over. As they start to go, a man spots Willie, 
goes over to him, and lifts Willie's arm in the air.

MAN
Oh, Lord, I'm punished for voting 
against an honest man.

This sudden action brings response; women begin to cry and 
people push their way forward to grab Willie by the hand.

VOICES OF THE MOURNERS
God bless you, Willie. If we had 
only listened to you, Willie. You 
were right, Willie. Let me shake

No more politics, eh, Willie?

WILLIE
No, I worked too hard in my time to 
get there. I think I'll just go on 
practicing law and make a little 
more money.

JACK
The question I'd like to know is, 
why all the speeches you're making 
around the countryside?

Willie is about to answer when he hears the sound of 
approaching cars.

WILLIE
Wonder who that is?

He goes to the window, and we see a big black limousine 
turning into his drive. He opens the door and waits as Sadie, 
Duffy, Dolph Pillsbury, and other politicians climb the steps 
to meet him.

DUFFY
Brought some people all the way up 
from the state capital just to meet 
you.

Willie Stark walks out on the platform at the rear of the

at the station.

WILLIE
Folks, if you'll just bear patiently 
with me for a couple of minutes, I'd 
like to tell you what this state

program. Now I'd like to give you

Stand... sit...

JACK
Thanks... Tell me, what are you on

SADIE
I take notes.

JACK
For whom?

SADIE
For those who pay me.

JACK
Which is.

SADIE
People.

JACK
Smart people.

SADIE
Oh, yeah. Anybody that pays me is 
smart.

JACK
You don't have to be smart to frame 
a guy like Willie Stark.

SADIE
No. No, brother, you don't.

JACK
(lights a cigarette)
It is a frame, isn't it?

SADIE
Why don't you give me a cigarette?

JACK
(gives her the pack)
To split the vote and win the election 
for Harrison, huh?

SADIE
If you know, why do you ask?

JACK
I just want to make sure.

SADIE
Yeah.

JACK
Look, why don't you tell the boys 
back home to save their money. Willie 
couldn't steal a vote from... from 
Abe Lincoln in the Cradle of the 
Confederacy.

SADIE
I wish the poor... had enough sense 
to have somebody give him a good 
greasing for the beating he's going 
to get. 'Cause this way all he gets 
out of it is the ride.
(looks at Willie 
through the window)
Hey, those speeches! Ain't they awful? 
Ain't they just plain awful? Question 
to you: if somebody told him he was 
a sucker, do you think he'd quit?

Willie has just finished his speech and is on his way over 
to the hotel.

JACK
I don't know, Sadie. I really don't 
know.

Listen, Willie, try it on your feet 
this time.

WILLIE
Oh, no. Wait a minute. My feet are 
killing me. Let me stay here, huh?

JACK
All right... Look, Willie, you tell 
'em too much. Just tell 'em you're 
going to soak the fat boys and forget 
the rest of the tax stuff.

WILLIE
(pathetically)
That's what I say.

JACK
But it's the way you say it. Willie, 
make 'em cry. Make 'em laugh, make 
'em mad, even mad at you. Stir 'em 
up and they'll love it and come back 
for more. But for heaven's sake don't 
try and improve their minds.

WILLIE
(suddenly)
A man don't have to be governor.

JACK
(surprised)
What?

WILLIE
A man don't have to be governor.

Pause.

JACK
Well, they haven't counted up the 
votes yet.

WILLIE
(quietly)
Oh, I'm going to lose, Mr. Burden. I 
know that. Don't try and fool me. 
I'm not going to lie to you. I wanted 
it. I wanted it so badly I stayed up 
nights thinking about it. A man wants 
something so badly he gets mixed up 
in knowing what he wants. It's 
something inside of you. I would 
have made a good governor. Better 
than those other fellows.

There is a knock on the door.

JACK
Come in.

WILLIE
(almost to himself)
A great governor.

Sadie enters. She immediately spots the liquor, and pours 
herself a drink.

SADIE
Since you won't let me sleep you 
might at least give me a drink.

WILLIE
(muttering)
Build them highways... greatest system 
of highways in the country.

JACK
(to Sadie)
Help yourself.

WILLIE
I'll build schools.

SADIE
(to Jack)
What's up?

JACK
Nothing... except Willie here has 
been saying as how he's not going to 
be governor.

SADIE
(directly, to Jack)
So you told him.

JACK
I don't tell anyone anything... I 
just listen.

SADIE
(goes to Willie)
Who told you?

WILLIE
Told me what? Told me what?

SADIE
That you're not going to be governor.

WILLIE
(getting up)
Jack! Told me what?... Told me what?

Jack says nothing. Sadie gulps down her drink, bangs the 
empty glass on the bureau top, and turns to face Willie.

SADIE
(loudly)
All right! That you've been framed, 
you poor sap.

Willie looks at her steadily for a moment.

WILLIE
(quietly)
Framed?

SADIE
And how! Oh, you decoy, you woodenhead 
decoy! And you let 'em. You let 'em 
because you thought you were the 
little lamb of God. But you know 
what you are?
(she waits for his 
answer; he has none)
Well, you're the goat! You are the 
sacrificial goat! You are a sap... 
because you let 'em.

JACK
Sadie! That's enough.

SADIE
Enough? He didn't even get anything 
out of it. Oh, they'd have paid you 
to take a rap like that, but they 
didn't have to pay a sap like you. 
Oh, no, you were so full of yourself 
and hot air, all you wanted was a 
chance to stand up on your hind legs 
and make a speech: my friends, what 
this state needs is a good five-cent 
cigar. What this state needs is a --

WILLIE
(to Jack)
Is it true?

SADIE
(prayerfully, to the 
ceiling)
He wants to know if it's true.

WILLIE
Is it true?

JACK
That's what they tell me.

There is a long pause. Willie looks almost as if he is going 
to cry. Sadie pours out another drink, a stiff one.

SADIE
(handing it to him)
Here.

Willie drinks it all.

JACK
Hey, lay off that. You're not used 
to it.

SADIE
(jeeringly)
He's not used to a lot of things. 
Are you, Willie?

JACK
(angrily)
Why don't you lay off of him, Sadie?

SADIE
(ignores Jack)
Are you, Willie? Are you? Are you... 
are you, are you, are you?

She shoves the bottle at him. He takes it and pours himself 
a drink.

DISSOLVE TO:

Willie is snoring on the bed. Sadie's coat is thrown over

SADIE
Hi.

JACK
Well, things seem to have quieted 
down.

SADIE
(laughs)
Yeah, I quieted him down.

JACK
Yeah. How was he? Noisy?

SADIE
Oh, he reared some. He's been telling 
me all the things he's going to do. 
He's going to do big things, this 
fella. He's going to be President. 
He's going to kill people with his 
bare hands. I quieted him down... 
Hey! Who's Lucy?

JACK
His wife.

SADIE
He talks like she's his mammy... 
she's going to blow his nose for 
him.

Jack sits on the bed next to Willie.

JACK
Well, I'll take him from here on in. 
They're waiting for him at the 
barbecue.

Sadie pulls her coat off Willie and goes to the door.

SADIE
Yeah, well give me a receipt for the

She leaves. Jack bends over Willie, who continues to snore.

Willie takes a seat on the children's swing as Jack goes off

Willie waves them off. Jack returns with the coffee and pours

more, then gulps his drink down.

Duffy, Pillsbury, and the other politicians stand on the

goes over to Sadie, who is standing on the steps of the 
platform.

DUFFY
Where is he?

SADIE

There he is.

Escorted by Jack, Willie approaches the platform and stumbles 
up the steps past Sadie.

SADIE
Whoops!

DUFFY
(to Jack)
Is he drunk?

JACK
Never touches the stuff. Lucy doesn't 
favor drinkin'.

Duffy follows Willie up on the platform.

SADIE

How'd you get him here? He was out 
stiff.

JACK
Hair of the dog that bit him.

SADIE
Hair? He must have swallowed the

On the platform, Duffy looks uneasily at the bleary-eyed 
Willie. The band suddenly plays a fanfare, and the chairman 
steps up to the microphone.

CHAIRMAN
Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me a 
great deal of pleasure to introduce 
to you that true man of the people, 
the next governor of the state... 
Willie Stark.

There is scattered applause as Willie steps forward to speak.

WILLIE
My friends...

He turns his face from side to side, and fumbles in the right 
side of his coat pocket to fish out his speech.

WILLIE
My friends... I...

He tries to focus on the speech, which he clutches before 
his eyes with both hands. Then he lifts his head, and looks 
directly at the people who have come to hear him. As he 
speaks, the camera focuses on the faces of these people: the 
farmers, workers, hicks, red-necks who are Willie's audience, 
Willie's people.

WILLIE
I have a speech here. It's a speech 
about what this state needs. There's 
no need in my telling you what this 
state needs. You are the state and 
you know what you need... You over 
there... look at your pants. Have 
they got holes in the knees? Listen 
to your stomach. Did you ever hear 
it rumble from hunger?... And you, 
what about your crops? Did they ever 
rot in the field because the road 
was so bad you couldn't get them to 
market?... And you. What about your 
kids? Are they growing up ignorant 
as dirt, ignorant as you, 'cause 
there's no school for them?... No, 
I'm not going to read you any speech.

He throws his speech away. Duffy looks alarmed.

WILLIE
But I am going to tell you a story. 
It's a funny story...

SADIE
(from the steps)
Hey!

WILLIE'S VOICE
...So get ready to laugh.

SADIE
What's he up to?

JACK
Shut up!

WILLIE
Get ready to bust your sides laughing, 
'cause it's sure a funny story. It's 
about a hick... a hick like you, if 
you please. Yeah, like you. He grew 
up on the dirt roads and gully washes 
of a farm. He knew what it was to 
get up before dawn and get feed and 
slop and milk before breakfast... 
and then set out before sunup and 
walk six miles to a one-room, slab-
sided schoolhouse. Oh, this hick 
knew what it was to be a hick, all 
right. He figured if he was going to 
get anything done, he had to do it 
himself. So he sat up nights and 
studied books. He studied law because 
he thought he might be able to change 
things some... for himself, and for 
folks like him.

Sugar Boy listens intently, sharing in the anger in Willie's 
speech.

WILLIE
No, I'm not going to lie to you. He 
didn't start off thinking about the 
hicks and all the wonderful things 
he was going to do for them. No. No, 
he started off thinking of number 
one. But something came to him on 
the way. How he could do nothing for 
himself without the help of the 
people. That's what came to him. And 
it also came to him, with the powerful 
force of God's own lightning, back 
in his home country, when a 
schoolhouse collapsed because it was 
built of politics... rotten brick. 
It killed and mangled a dozen kids. 
But you know that story. The people 
were his friends because he fought 
that rotten brick. And some of the 
politicians down in the city, they 
knew that... So they rode up to his 
house in a big, fine, shiny car and 
said as how they wanted him to run 
for governor...

Jack, electrified, grips Sadie's arm.

JACK
Sadie, he's wonderful... wonderful...

Duffy fidgets as Willie continues to pace and speak, his 
face filled with conviction, and with fury.

WILLIE
...So they told the hick... and he 
swallowed it. He looked in his heart 
and he thought in all humility how 
he'd like to try and change things. 
He was just a country boy who thought 
that even the plainest, poorest man 
can be governor if his fellow citizens 
find he's got the stuff for the job. 
Well, those fellows in the striped 
pants... they saw the hick and they 
took him in.

He points his finger at Duffy, who is coming over to speak 
to him.

DUFFY
(low voice)
Willie, what are you trying to do?

Willie turns on him, roaring.

WILLIE
There he is! There's your Judas 
Iscariot.
(he pushes Duffy across 
the platform)
Look at him... lickspittle... nose-
wiper.

Duffy gestures frantically to the band.

DUFFY
Play! Play!

WILLIE
(pushing him again)
Look at him!

DUFFY
Play anything.

The band starts to play, adding to the pandemonium. Willie 
shouts above it.

WILLIE
Look at him! Joe Harrison's dummy! 
Look at him!

DUFFY
That's a lie!

WILLIE
Look at him!

Duffy signals to some of his goons standing near the platform.

DUFFY
Go get him, boys... go get him.

Sugar Boy leaps up on the platform, his pistol drawn and 
pointed at Duffy's men. Willie throws up his arms to silence 
the crowd.

WILLIE
Now, shut up! Shut up, all of you. 
Now, listen to me, you hicks. Yeah, 
you're hicks too, and they fooled 
you a thousand times, just like they 
fooled me. But this time I'm going

All right, listen to me... listen to

I thought the Chronicle line was --

MADISON
Divide and conquer? Stark is getting 
too big for his britches and the 
hicks are getting too smart. We're 
now supporting Harrison.

JACK
(stands up)
How do you square that?

MADISON
I work here.

JACK
(putting on his coat)
Well, I don't... not any more.

MADISON
Jack, you fool.

JACK
If you had any guts you'd print

MADISON
I work here. I take orders.

Same for me.

WILLIE

(to Jack)
I hear you got fired from the paper.

JACK
You heard wrong, Willie. I quit.

WILLIE
(passing the beer 
back to Sugar Boy)
You're smart. 'Cause before I'm 
through with that mob they're not 
going to have enough money left to 
pay the boy that cleans the spittoons.

JACK
How do you feel, Willie?

WILLIE
I feel fine, fine. You see, Jack, I

This is Jack Burden, a friend of 
mine. From now on he's going to live 
here. Give him anything he wants.

The group starts up the stairs, past the officers who are 
standing guard. Duffy stops to speak to one, pointing his 
finger at some of his men standing below.

DUFFY
Let these boys through, officer.

WILLIE

Duffy works for me now.

JACK
It looks like everybody works for 
you.

They start up the second flight of stairs.

WILLIE
No. No, not yet. But I want to keep 
him around. He reminds me of something 
I never want to forget.

Willie stops and looks around at Duffy's men hurrying up the 
steps.

WILLIE

Come on, come on, come on, come on.

What do you think, Sugar? Do they 
look like good boys?

If they all look like them I'd hate

That's the object. Not like when

How is Tom?

WILLIE
Oh, he's fine. He starts college in

Listen, baby, you've got to double-

He walks over to Jack, who leans back on the bed.

WILLIE
From now on you're working for me.

JACK
Doing what?

WILLIE
I don't know. Something will turn 
up, won't it, Sadie?

SADIE
Yeah. We need a college man around... 
for research.

WILLIE
How much did they pay you on that 
newspaper?

JACK
Three hundred dollars a month.

WILLIE
(laughs)
I could buy you cheap, couldn't I?

JACK
For a bag of salt.

WILLIE
No. No, I don't play that way. I 
like you, boy. I always have. I'll 
tell you what I'll do. I'll give you 
four hundred dollars a month and 
traveling expenses.

JACK
You throw money around like it was 
money.

Willie gets up and walks to the window.

Mrs. Burden, and McEvoy are part of the audience sitting 
around the fireplace. Jack stands next to Willie.

STANTON
I have a question.

WILLIE
Shoot.

STANTON
A lot of people in this state have 
been saying that you've been making 
deals... some of them with the very 
groups that you claim you're against. 
Is that true?

JACK
Adam, you know how rumors start...

WILLIE
Yes. Yes, that's true. I have nothing 
to hide. I'll make a deal with the 
devil if it'll help me carry out my 
program. But believe me, there are 
no strings attached to those deals.

STANTON
You're sure about that?

WILLIE
Doc, Jack here has been telling me 
how you feel about things... how 
you'd like to see a new hospital 
built, a hospital that's the biggest 
and best that money can buy. You 
want those things, Doc, because, 
well, because you're a man who wants 
to do good. Now, I'd like to ask you 
a question.

STANTON
Shoot.

The guests laugh good-naturedly.

WILLIE
Do you know what good comes out of?

STANTON
You tell me, Mr. Stark.

WILLIE
Out of bad... that's what good comes 
out of. Because you can't make it 
out of anything else. You didn't 
know that, did you?

STANTON
No, I didn't... There's another 
question I'd like to ask you. You 
say there's only bad to start with 
and the good must come with the bad. 
Who's to determine what's good and 
what's bad?... You?

WILLIE
Why not?

STANTON
How?

WILLIE
Why, that's easy. Just... just make 
it up as you go along.

More laughter. Willie smiles and goes on.

WILLIE
Folks, there's a time to talk and 
there's a time to act. I think the 
time to act is right now. And with 
your support, I not only will win 
but I will do all of the things I 
promised. I need your help. Oh, I 
need it badly. But I'm not going to 
beg for it. In the name of this state 
which we love... in the name of the 
governor in whose house we meet... I 
demand it.

I'm an old bird... I...

WILLIE
But a game one.

They laugh.

WILLIE
Look, I'll give you complete power 
as attorney general. You can do 
anything you see fit. I'll swing the 
ax to clear the way for you. Is that 
a deal?

The Judge smiles, then puts out his hand.

It's a deal.

They shake hands.

The crowd erupts into cheers as he steps outside.

This is not a time for speechmaking. 
I should get on my knees and ask God 
to give me strength to carry out 
your will.

Loud cheers. Adam watches Anne. She applauds. Willie looks 
down at the crowd and continues his speech.

WILLIE
This much I swear to you. These things 
you shall have. I'm going to build a 
hospital. The biggest that money can 
buy... and it will belong to you. 
That any man, woman, or child who is 
sick or in pain can go through those 
doors and know that everything will 
be done for them that man can do. To 
heal sickness. To ease pain. Free. 
Not as a charity, but as a right. 
And it is your right that every child 
shall have a complete education. 
That any man who produces anything 
can take it to market without paying 
toll. And no poor man's land or farm 
can be taxed or taken away from him. 
And it is the right of the people 
that they will not be deprived of 
hope...

The crowd applauds, and Willie waves. We see Anne, face aglow,

He's been two-timing Lucy. So there's 
another kind of arithmetic for what 
he's doing to you.

SADIE
Lucy?

If she had her way he'd be back in 
Kanoma City slopping the hogs right

Look at you, Pillsbury. Fifty years 
old, gut-sprung, teeth gone, never 
had a dime. If the Almighty had 
intended for you to be rich he'd 
have taken care of that a long time 
ago. The idea of you being rich... 
that's plain blasphemy. Ain't that a

Pillsbury doesn't answer.

WILLIE
Answer me!

PILLSBURY
Yes.

Louder, man. Don't mumble. Speak up. 
Say it's a fact, a blasphemous fact.

Sugar Boy laughs loudly. The phone rings and Sadie picks it

Sugar Boy exists. Willie turns back to Pillsbury.

WILLIE
Now, you know what you're supposed 
to do, don't you, Pillsbury? You're 
supposed to stay poor and take orders. 
Oh, there'll be some sweetening for 
you from time to time... but Duffy'll 
take care of that. Don't you go 
setting yourself up on your own again, 
do you understand that?

PILLSBURY
Yes.

WILLIE
Louder, man. And say, I understand

Judge Stanton enters.

WILLIE
Oh, hello, Judge. Sit down. I'll be 
with you in just a couple of seconds.
(back to Pillsbury)
Now write what I tell you to write... 
Dear Governor Stark. I wish to resign 
as auditor due to ill health, to 
take effect as soon as you can relieve 
me. Respectfully yours.
(after a pause)
Did you sign it?

PILLSBURY
No.

WILLIE
(roaring)
Well, sign it! Don't put any date on 
it. I can fill that in when I need 
it.

Pillsbury signs the paper.

WILLIE
Now bring it to me.

Pillsbury moves slowly, so Sadie yanks the paper out of his 
hand and passes it to Willie.

WILLIE
Now get out.

Pillsbury slinks out of the room.

JUDGE
The papers have the story.

WILLIE
Yeah, I know.

JUDGE
They're talking about impeachment 
proceedings.

WILLIE
(rising)
Against who?

JUDGE
This time, Pillsbury.

WILLIE
I got that "this time," Judge.

JUDGE
How true is it?

WILLIE
It's too true.

The phone rings.

SADIE
Yes?
(hands phone to Willie)
This is it, Willie. Jeff Hopkins on 
the wire.

Willie takes the phone, but puts his hand over the mouthpiece 
so that he can speak to Jack.

WILLIE
What have we got on Hopkins, Jack?
(as Jack riffles 
through the black 
book)
Hello, Jeff. About that Pillsbury 
business...
(reads from black 
book Jack holds out 
for him)
Here's what I want you to do when it 
comes up in the legislature. Now, 
wait a minute, wait a minute. You 
listen to me.
(still reading from 
book)
You got a mortgage coming due on 
that place of yours in about five 
weeks, haven't you? You'd like to 
get it renewed, wouldn't you?
(pause)
All right, Tiny'll talk to you in 
the morning.

He grins and hangs up the phone.

WILLIE
Get going, Tiny.

Duffy leaves.

JUDGE
You haven't answered my question. 
Why are you saving Pillsbury's hide?

WILLIE
I'm not a bit interested in 
Pillsbury's hide. It's something 
much more important than that. If 
the McMurphy boys get the notion 
they can get away with this, there's 
no telling where they'll stop.

JUDGE
(quietly)
Or where you will... Pillsbury is 
guilty. As attorney general of this 
state, it's my job to prosecute.

WILLIE
Judge, you talk like Pillsbury was... 
was human. He isn't. He's a thing. 
You don't prosecute an adding machine 
if the spring goes busted and makes 
a mistake. You fix it. Well, I fixed 
him. I'm not a bit interested in 
Pillsbury. It's something much bigger 
than that.

JUDGE
(getting up)
Yes, it is.

JACK
He's right, Judge. Can't you see 
that he's right?

JUDGE
He's right because you want him to 
be right. Because you're afraid to 
admit you've made a mistake. Do it 
now before it's too late.
(to Willie)
I'm offering my resignation as 
attorney general. You'll have it in 
writing by messenger in the morning... 
dated.

WILLIE
(softly)
It took you a long time to make up 
your mind, Judge. A long time. What 
made you take such a long time?

JUDGE
I wasn't sure.

WILLIE
And now you are?

The Judge nods.

WILLIE
I'll tell you what you are. You're 
scared. You sat in that big easy 
chair of yours for thirty years and 
played at being a judge. Then all of 
a sudden I came along and put a bat 
in your hand, and I said, go ahead, 
Judge, start swinging. And you did. 
And you had a wonderful time. But 
now you're scared. You don't want to 
get your hands dirty. You want to 
pick up the marbles... but you don't 
want to get your hands dirty. Look 
at my whole program, Judge. How do 
you think I put that across?

JUDGE
I knew how, but I never knew why.

He starts to leave.

WILLIE
You're not by any chance thinking of 
going over to McMurphy's boys, are 
you?

JUDGE
I'm through with politics.

WILLIE
I'm happy to hear that.
(extends his hand)
No hard feelings.

JUDGE
(ignores the hand)
Goodbye, Governor.
(to Jack)
Are you coming with me, Jack?

Jack turns away.

JUDGE
You're making a mistake.

He goes. Willie closes the door behind him.

WILLIE
Do you think he means it when he 
says he's through with politics, 
Sadie?

SADIE
No. No, I don't.

WILLIE
What about you, Jack?

JACK
I've known the Judge all my life. 
He's always meant everything he's 
said.

WILLIE
All right. All right. Take it easy. 
I'll take your word for it.

DISSOLVE TO:

Exterior: Willie's Hotel, Night

Willie's car draws up to the curb. Sugar Boy hops out to 
open the door for Willie.

Sadie is watching him from a window upstairs in the hotel. 
Anne is in the back seat; Willie leans down to talk to her.

WILLIE
Sugar, take Miss Stanton home.
(to Anne)
When am I going to see you again?

She doesn't answer.

WILLIE
What's the matter, Anne?

ANNE
Please take me home now, Sugar Boy.

WILLIE
You've got to understand me.

ANNE
(turns away)
I understand you. It's myself I don't 
understand.

WILLIE
Do you think I like sneaking around 
corners any more than you do? But 
right now, with the Pillsbury business 
and with your uncle quitting... If I 
got a divorce...

ANNE
Maybe we'd better stop seeing each 
other.

WILLIE
No. No, we won't stop seeing each 
other, will we?

ANNE
(slowly)
No.

WILLIE
Because you believe in what I tell 
you.

ANNE
(puts her hand on his)
Because I believe what you tell me.

Sadie approaches.

SADIE
Good evening, Governor Stark.
(looks at Anne, but 
talks to Willie)
I thought you might like to know 
that Judge Stanton kept his promise.
(directly to Willie)
He gave the story to every paper in 
town.

WILLIE
Sugar, meet me at the hotel as soon 
as you can.

FADE OUT

FADE IN:

NEWSPAPER HEADLINE

ATTORNEY GENERAL RESIGNS:
STANTON ACCUSES STARK OF
QUASHING PILLSBURY GRAFT

Interior: State Legislature Assembly Room, Day

Duffy stands in the forground, looking in on the uproar and 
confusion of the assembly.

SENATOR
These are serious charges that Judge 
Stanton has given to the press. This 
legislature is entitled to a complete 
and full report on the Pillsbury 
affair. Let the truth be known.

2ND SENATOR
Let it come out.

3RD SENATOR
I move that we adjourn.

4TH SENATOR
I second the motion.

CHAIRMAN
All those in favor, say aye... Motion 
carried. The house is adjourned.

As Duffy turns and walks away, other senators rise up in 
their seats in protest.

DISSOLVE TO:

MONTAGE: PILLSBURY SCANDAL

Sign on building reads: CITIZENS COMMITTEE MEETING, Subject: 
PILLSBURY SCANDAL, 8 P.M. Tonight -- Town Hall.

A man pastes a strip across the sign: CANCELED.

A man is making a speech to a small group of people.

MAN
If you let Willie Stark get away 
with the Pillsbury graft, there's no 
telling...

Thugs break up the meeting. The speaker is beaten up. Jack 
Burden turns through the pages of the little black book.

DISSOLVE TO:

Interior: Stark's Hotel Suite, Day

Willie is lying on the bed. Jack is seated. Sadie and Sugar 
Boy stand nearby.

JACK
But we beat the Pillsbury rap... 
It's over.

WILLIE
These things are never over. I'll 
tell you what I want you to do, Jack. 
I want you to start a new page in 
that black book of yours... under 
then name of Judge Stanton.

JACK
You're crazy. There's nothing on the 
Judge.

SADIE
Why? Because his name is Stanton?

WILLIE
Ssshhh, easy.

JACK
What if I won't do it?

WILLIE
You know, some of this has rubbed 
off on you.

JACK
What are you going to do? Have me 
shot?

WILLIE
No... no... but I'll have to get 
myself a new boy.

JACK
I tell you there's nothing on the 
Judge.

WILLIE
Jack, there's something on everybody. 
Man is conceived in sin and born in 
corruption.

JACK
It's a waste of time.

WILLIE
What's the matter, Jack? Are you 
afraid you might find something out?

Jack stares at him.

DISSOLVE TO:

Exterior: Burden's Landing Ferry, Night

Jack's car is seen coming across on the ferry.

JACK
(voice over)
I kept saying to myself that Willie 
was wrong about the Judge. If there 
was anything left at Burden's Landing, 
it was honor. I had to believe that.

DISSOLVE TO:

Interior: Stanton Living Room, Night

Jack and Anne stand together in the living room.

JACK
Anne, I want to ask you a question. 
Was the Judge ever broke? Really 
broke?

ANNE
Why do you want to know?

JACK
I don't want to know, but I've got 
to.

ANNE
Did he tell you --

JACK
Did who tell me?

ANNE
I don't know. I... how should I know 
if the Judge was ever broke?

She walks away from him. Adam enters, carrying bundles of 
food and two wine bottles.

STANTON
Hello... Come on, Anne, take this 
food and start cooking. I'm hungry.

Anne takes the grocery bundles. Jack grabs the wine.

JACK
Me, I'm on the thirsty side. Bring 
some glasses, Anne, quick.

He joins Adam, who has opened the piano.

STANTON
(laughing)
It's been a long time since I played 
this thing. What do you say we wake 
up the ghosts, huh?

JACK
(calling to Anne)
Another glass, Anne, for a ghost.

STANTON
(starting to play)
Remember the last time I played this? 
You and Anne were dancing?

Anne returns with three glasses. Jack grabs her around the 
waist and whirls her around.

JACK
Shall we dance?

ANNE
Let's... let's have a drink first.

Adam starts to pour the wine.

JACK
No, no... keep playing. Anne and I 
want to hear this, don't we, Anne?
(Jack pours the wine)
Adam... ghost... and me.

STANTON
What shall we drink to?

JACK
To the ghost?... To Adam, to the 
director of the new medical center.

STANTON
(bangs the piano keys)
Don't you ever stop working for him?

ANNE
Adam!

STANTON
I came up here to get away...

JACK
I'm sorry, Adam.

ANNE
Well, I'm not. What's wrong with 
being the director of the new medical 
center?

STANTON
Nothing, except that I'm not going 
to take it.

JACK
Why? Because your uncle resigned?

STANTON
That's partly it. There are other 
things.

ANNE
What other things?

STANTON
(looks at her)
You too?

ANNE
Yes, me too.

JACK
Anne, if Adam doesn't want to discuss 
it, let's not.

STANTON
All right, let's discuss it.

ANNE
But calmly.

STANTON
Calmly. Go ahead, Jack. Why do you 
think he wants me?

JACK
Because you're the best man for the 
job.

STANTON
It could have nothing to do with my 
name being Stanton?

JACK
It could have. Let's grant that.

STANTON
That's your answer.

JACK
No, it's not. If that were the only 
answer I wouldn't be with him any 
more. There's another side of it. 
I've learned something from him. You 
can't make an omelet without cracking 
eggs.

STANTON
Or heads.

ANNE
But at least a hospital will be built, 
and the sick will be cared for.

STANTON
At what price?

JACK
At any price.

STANTON
Do you really believe that, Jack?

JACK
I really believe that Stark wants to 
do good. You do too. It's a matter 
of method. Many times out of evil 
comes good. Well, pain is an evil. 
As a doctor you should know that.

STANTON
Pain is an evil; it is not evil. It 
is not evil in itself. Stark is evil.

JACK
The people of the state don't think 
so.

STANTON
How would they know? The first thing 
he did was to take over the newspapers 
and the radio stations. Why be so 
afraid of criticism? If Stark is 
interested in doing good, he should 
also be interested in the truth. I 
don't see how you can separate the 
two. No, Stark is not for me.

ANNE
(upset)
No, Stark is not for you. Well, what 
is for you? Pride. Pride, that's all 
it is... foolish, stupid pride. All 
you've ever talked about is what you 
could do if... if somebody would 
tear down and build. All right, all 
right, somebody has, and he's given 
it to you. But he's not for you. No, 
he's not for you.

She throws down her glass and runs crying from the room. 
Adam goes after her.

STANTON
Anne... Anne...

Interior: Stanton Hallway and Stairs, Night

Anne runs upstairs and Adam follows. The Judge comes out of 
his room to see what has happened, sees Jack standing at the 
foot of the stairs, hesitates a moment, and then goes back 
to his room without speaking.

DISSOLVE TO:

Interior: County Recorder Room, Day

Jack enters and speaks to a clerk, who then directs him to 
one of the files. He starts to look through the files marked 
MORTGAGES DEFAULTED.

JACK
(voice over)
Will I find anything, Judge? Will I? 
I didn't find it all at once. It 
takes a long time to go through old 
courthouse records and musty deeds... 
a very long time. But it wasn't too 
hard for me. I was well trained in 
research, especially this kind.

He pulls out a file.

JACK
(voice over)
I found what I didn't want to find.

He takes the file back to the clerk.

JACK
Have some photostat copies made of 
these. I'll be back tomorrow for 
them.

DISSOLVE TO:

Interior: Jack's Hotel Bedroom, Day

Jack is lying on his bed, looking over the documents that 
relate to the Judge. He looks haggard and worried. There is 
a knock on the door. Jack doesn't answer; the knock is 
repeated.

JACK
Who is it?

SADIE'S VOICE
It's me, Sadie Burke.

JACK
Wait a minute.

He hides the documents under his pillow.

JACK
All right, come in.

She comes in, sniffs the air.

SADIE
Phew! Awful lot of smoke. Awful lot 
of whisky. You sober?

JACK
Stone.

SADIE
I'll have one with you.
(starts tidying up 
the room)
What are you hiding out for?

JACK
I'm not. I've been sleeping.

SADIE
For four days? You've been back in 
town for four days.

JACK
Willie knows everything.

SADIE
Willie's worried about his boy.

JACK
Willie's boy is worried about Willie's 
boy.

SADIE
Well, why don't you put something on 
the phonograph -- a low-down, mean 
blues. Play it over and over again 
until you're sick of it. Then crack 
it and go back to work.
(sits down)
I do it all the time.

JACK
That's not my problem.

SADIE
No, it isn't your problem.
(gets up again)
I'll wait for you if you want to 
powder your nose.

Jack goes into the bathroom.

JACK
I'll be with you in a minute.

Sadie wanders around. She goes to the dresser, upon which is 
a photograph of Anne Stanton. She picks up the picture and 
places it so she can see it in the mirror and compare it 
with her own reflection.

SADIE
Hmmm. Yeah, I can see it. I've got 
to look in the mirror to be able to 
see it. Soft, white skin... not like 
mine.
(runs her hand across 
her cheeks)
I had smallpox when I was a kid. 
Where I lived it seemed nearly all 
the kids had smallpox...

Jack watches her through the open bathroom door.

SADIE
It leaves your face hard. Then she's 
got poise. Look at the way she holds 
her head... at just the right angle. 
That takes training. That takes years 
of training...

Jack, towel in hand, comes out and stands behind her. He 
looks at her in the mirror, puzzled.

SADIE
I see what Willie sees. Willie's got 
big ideas, Jack.

JACK
What do you mean?

SADIE
A girl like that could be a governor's 
wife. Or even a President's.

JACK
What are you talking about?

SADIE
He ditched Lucy, he ditched me, and 
he'll ditch you.

JACK
(shaking her)
Answer me!

SADIE
He'll ditch everybody in the whole 
world because that's what Willie 
wants. Nobody in the world but him.

JACK
What are you talking about?

SADIE
You and your high-tone friends. What 
do they know? What do they know about 
anything? Why did you have to mix 
her in?

JACK
You're crazy, Sadie. You're out of 
your mind.

SADIE
Am I? Well, why don't you go down 
and ask her. Or ask him. Ask Willie.

JACK
Shut up!

SADIE
Go ahead, ask him.

JACK
Shut up!

SADIE
Ask him!

He slaps her hard.

SADIE
Ow-oo... oh... oh.

She starts to laugh.

DISSOLVE TO:

Exterior: Football Field, Day

A football team is practicing on the field. Willie watches 
from the bench. A player kicks the ball and Tom misses it. 
Jack walks over to Willie.

JACK
He's off today.

WILLIE
It's only practice. He'll be all 
right tomorrow... You been gone a 
long time, Jack.

JACK
Yeah. I figured if you needed me 
you'd yell.

WILLIE
Why'd you lay around the hotel?

JACK
Thinking.

WILLIE
About what?

JACK
Things.

WILLIE
What did you find on the Judge?

JACK
Nothing.

WILLIE
You sure you didn't find anything on 
the Judge?

JACK
Yeah, I'm sure.

WILLIE
You're going to keep trying, aren't 
you?

JACK
If you want me to.

WILLIE
I want you to. There's something 
else I want you to do too.

JACK
What? Bucket boy? Towel slinger? 
What?

WILLIE
(looks at him closely)
What's eating you, Jack?

JACK
(avoiding it)
What else do you want me to do?

WILLIE
If you've got something on your mind, 
boy, spit it out. We've been together 
too long to play games.

JACK
What do you want me to do?

WILLIE
I hear your pal Adam Stanton turned 
down the job as director of the 
hospital. That's bad. Especially at 
a time like this.

JACK
Oh? How did you hear it?

WILLIE
Why? What difference does it make?

JACK
I just wanted to know.

WILLIE
I heard it around.

JACK
(insistent)
How did you hear he turned it down, 
Willie?

Out on the field the boys have stopped playing and are huddled 
around the coach.

WILLIE
I'll be right back, Jack. I want to 
see what's happening here.

He goes over to the group on the field. The coach is talking 
to Tom.

COACH
You going to practice the way I tell 
you.

TOM
I'm going to do it the way I want to 
do it.

Willie comes up to them.

WILLIE
Tom, come here. What's going on here?

COACH
I don't care if he is your son, 
Governor... No special rules for 
him.

TOM
It doesn't make any difference to me 
either way... whether I play or not.

WILLIE
Well, it does to me.
(to coach)
What do you want him to do?

COACH
To behave himself. Like the rest of 
the boys. Four times this season 
he's broken training. He comes on 
the practice field half potted.

WILLIE
Tom, you're going to have to obey 
the rules. Do you hear me? You're 
going to obey the rules.

TOM
I put 'em across, don't I? Every 
Saturday I put 'em across and I can 
still do it, drunk or sober. That's 
all you want, isn't it... for me to 
put 'em across so you can big-shot 
it around? Isn't that all you want?

He walks away.

WILLIE
Tom!
(to coach)
He's a little high-strung.
(goes after Tom)
Tom, come here. Tom!

DISSOLVE TO:

Exterior: Highway, Foggy Day

Sign in foreground reads: WILLIE STARK HIGHWAY U.S. 56. A 
car swerves around a bend and careens down the highway.

Tom and his girl friend Helene are in the car. Tom is 
drinking.

HELENE
(laughing)
Come on, Tommy... let's go faster. 
Come on...

The car goes across a bridge, weaving. Two motorcycle cops 
parked there start to give chase.

Tom's car swerves out of control and crashes through a fence.

The two motorcycle cops ride out to the field to the wrecked 
car. They find Tom and Helene, unconscious. One of the cops 
picks up the empty bottle and hands it to the other.

2ND COP
(looking at Tom)
It's the governor's son.

He throws the bottle away.

DISSOLVE TO:

Interior: Governor's Mansion, Night

Lucy and Mr. Hale walk across the large reception room toward 
Willie. Jack, Sugar Boy, and Duffy stand around in the 
background.

LUCY
Willie, Mr. Hale's here to see you.

Willie comes to meet them, a drink in his hand. He is 
obviously drunk.

WILLIE
Go on upstairs, Lucy. I have some 
business I want to talk over with 
Mr. Hale.

HALE
What I've got to say anybody can 
listen to... Where's your boy?

WILLIE
Now... now, don't get excited.
(to Sugar Boy)
Get me another drink, Sugar.

HALE
My daughter may die.

WILLIE
She's not going to die. She'll get 
the best medical attention there is. 
No expense will be spared.

HALE
Where's your boy?

LUCY
I'll get him.

WILLIE
Wait a minute, Lucy. He's asleep. 
And the doctor said after a good 
night's sleep he'll be all right.

LUCY
No, he won't be all right unless you 
make him all right. I'll get him.

She goes.

WILLIE
Lucy!
(to Hale)
You care for a drink?

HALE
No thanks.

WILLIE
Accidents will happen, you know.

HALE
Accidents? Your boy was drunk.

WILLIE
I saw the police report. There... 
there was nothing about drunkenness 
on the police report.

HALE
Whose police and whose report? I say 
the boy was drunk. And I know it.

Tom comes down the stairs, with Lucy.

HALE
(to Tom)
Right here before your father... I 
want you --

TOM
Mr. Hale --

WILLIE
Tom, the doctor says you need rest, 
boy.

TOM
(turns on him)
I don't want you to try to cover up 
for me. I was wrong... that's all 
there is to it.

WILLIE
You don't know what you're talking 
about. I saw the police report --

TOM
I don't care what the police report 
says. I was driving and I was drunk. 
It's all my fault.
(to Hale)
Anything you want to do to me, you 
can do. Whatever you want me to do, 
I'll do.

WILLIE
Nobody has to do anything. Stop 
worrying. I'll take care of 
everything.

TOM
I don't want you to take care of 
anything.

Tom looks ill; he presses his hand to his forehead.

WILLIE
Tom, go on upstairs and get some 
rest, boy. Go on... go on... go on.

Tom walks slowly toward the stairs.

WILLIE
Sugar, help him... Mr. Hale, come on 
over and sit down. You sure you 
wouldn't care for a drink, Mr. Hale?

Hale sits down, shakes his head.

WILLIE
Hey, Tiny, go home. Go on, out of 
here... out of here. Go on.

Duffy leaves, disgruntled. Willie sits on a coffee table. He 
pours himself another drink.

WILLIE
What business did you say you were 
in?

HALE
I didn't say.

WILLIE
What business are you in?

HALE
Trucking business.

WILLIE
Trucking business. Trucks run on 
state roads. If a man in the trucking 
business had a contract with the 
state, a big one, that would be pretty 
good, wouldn't it?
(to Jack)
Go on, Jack. Tell him what would 
happen.

Jack is silent.

WILLIE
Go on, tell him.

HALE
You're trying to bribe me, aren't 
you?

WILLIE
No, no. No, I'm not trying to bribe 
you. I'm... I'm only talking things 
over with you, that's all.

HALE
You're pretty good at talking. I 
remember when you first started 
talking. A place called Upton. You 
did a lot of talking then and the 
things you said made sense, to me 
and a lot of other people. I believed 
in you... I followed you... and I 
fought for you. Well, the words are 
still good. But you're not.
(rises)
And I don't believe you ever were.

He walks out of the room.

WILLIE
(after a pause)
Sugar, follow him. Keep calling in.

Sugar goes, leaving just Jack and Willie. Willie, very drunk, 
tries to get up but falls against the piano.

WILLIE
(yells)
Lucy!... Lucy!

He staggers up the long stairway. Halfway up he tumbles, 
groaning. Jack helps him to his feet.

JACK
I'd like Anne to see you now. I'd 
like Anne to see you now, you drunken 
sot!
(drags him up the 
stairs)
Come on.

FATHER MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARS AFTER BARING BRIBE OFFER BY 
GOVERNOR STARK

DISSOLVE TO:

Exterior: Governor's Mansion, Day

Willie, Jack, and Sugar Boy are accosted by a group of newsmen 
as they come down the stairs.

NEWSMEN
What about the girl's father, 
Governor? Have you a statement to 
make?

WILLIE
All right, all right, gentlemen. 
I'll give you a statement. This whole 
thing is a mess of lies. It's a frame. 
The man that made that statement... 
have him repeat it to my face. He 
can't. He vanished. Let me ask you 
some questions. Where has he gone? 
Where is he?

REPORTER
Maybe you could answer those questions 
too, Governor.

Sugar Boy makes a move for the reporter but Willie holds him 
back.

WILLIE
I won't dignify that question with 
an answer.

ANOTHER REPORTER
One more question, Governor... Where's 
your son?

WILLIE
At the football stadium, where he's 
supposed to be. He's going to play 
for State University, which this 
administration is responsible for. 
He's not hiding from anybody, 
gentlemen. He'll be out there in 
full view of seventy thousand cheering 
fans.
(starts down the stairs)
One of which will be me. See you, 
men.

He leaves, followed by Jack and Sugar Boy.

DISSOLVE TO:

Exterior: Football Field, Day

The game is in progress and the stands are packed. But there 
is no cheering. Instead we hear boos, and shouts for Tom.

CROWD VOICES
Where's Stark? How about Tommy Stark? 
Hey, Willie, send your boy in.

Exterior: Willie's Box

Willie, Jack, Sugar Boy, and Lucy are in one box. Sadie and 
Duffy sit in the adjoining one. Willie is standing up. The 
crowd continues to heckle him.

WILLIE
Why don't they put him in!

MAN
Come on, Willie... send your boy in.

A drunk comes over to his box.

DRUNK
What's the matter, Willie... is your 
little boy ashamed to show his face?

DUFFY
Shut up!

Willie signals angrily to the police.

WILLIE
Get that man out of here! Come on, 
get him out of here.

The man is dragged away. The crowd boos, and Willie gets up 
and leaves the box, followed by Jack.

DISSOLVE TO:

Interior: Stadium Dressing Room, Day

Tom is sitting on one of the massage tables with a towel 
around his shoulders as Willie and Jack come in. The sound 
of the boos can still be heard.

WILLIE
They're booing you.

TOM
(holds his head)
Ever since the accident, my head...

WILLIE
The doctor said it was nothing.

TOM
Get dizzy... can't see... dizzy...

WILLIE
You're scared... plain scared.

TOM
(looks up angrily)
Get out of here!

WILLIE
Atta boy... get mad. Show some spirit. 
Jack, tell him what his playing means. 
Go on, tell him.

JACK
You can never tell about a head 
injury. Maybe the boy's hurt.

WILLIE
He's hurt? I'm hurt. It wasn't me 
that wrapped that car around the 
tree. It wasn't me that got drunk. 
But me, I'm takin' the rap.
(softer, to Tom)
Go on, kid. Get out there and play. 
Show 'em the kind of stuff a Stark 
is made of.

TOM
(coldly)
I wouldn't know.

Enraged, Willie slaps him. Tom fights back, and Jack has to 
pull them apart.

JACK
Tom... cut it out!

TOM
(breathing heavily)
All right, I'll play. Now get out of 
here.

Camera holds on Tom as Jack and Willie leave. He picks up 
his uniform, stops, then rubs his head.

DISSOLVE TO:

Exterior: Football Stadium, Day

Tom is on the field. He runs up to the coach.

P.A. ANNOUNCER
Stark's going in!

The boos turn to cheers. The crowd applauds.

Willie signals from his box to the coach. He wants Tom sent 
in. Tom runs out on the field and joins the team. The players 
are lined up, in position to play. Tom shakes his head, as 
if trying to clear it.

DISSOLVE TO:

Exterior: Football Stadium, Time Lapse

The crowd yells excitedly. Tom, looking weary, gets the ball 
and runs with it downfield. Three players tackle him hard 
and fall on him. A silence falls over the stadium as he fails 
to get up with the others.

In Willie's box, everyone is standing.

LUCY
Tommy... Tommy... Tommy!

Willie rushes out onto the field and kneels beside Tom as 
the doctor and stretcher bearers arrive.

DISSOLVE TO:

Interior: Hospital Waiting Room, Night

Lucy and Willie are waiting for news about Tom. Sugar Boy 
comes in with a paper bag and sets it on a table.

SUGAR BOY
B-b-boss, you gotta eat. You g-g-
gotta.

Willie motions him away.

WILLIE
I'm the one that made him play. I 
sent him in.

LUCY
Sit down, Willie. Please sit down.

WILLIE
I sent him in.

LUCY
What difference does that make now?

Jack comes in.

WILLIE
What goes on?

JACK
There isn't a plane flying.

WILLIE
They gotta fly. This is my son. He's 
got to live.

Adam Stanton enters.

STANTON
I just got a call from Dr. Birnham. 
The earliest he can possibly get 
here will be tomorrow morning.

WILLIE
Isn't there anybody else we can get?

JACK
I still think Dr. Stanton should 
operate.

STANTON
That's up to Governor Stark. He wanted 
another doctor... a specialist. I 
sent for one.

WILLIE
How bad is it really, doctor?

STANTON
He's unconscious... and paralyzed.

Lucy slumps in her chair.

WILLIE
Has he got a chance?

STANTON
To live? Yes.

WILLIE
What do you mean?

STANTON
Even if the operation's successful -- 
that is, if he lives -- I think he'll 
be paralyzed for life.

WILLIE
You'll do everything you can, won't 
you? Anything between you and me.. 
that won't count, will it? It doesn't 
have to. Look, doc, anything you 
want in the world you just ask for 
it and you got it. Go on, doc... ask 
for it.

STANTON
(coldly)
There are some things, Governor Stark, 
that even you can't buy. Do you want 
me to operate, or don't you?

LUCY
Yes... I want you to operate.
(stands up)
Please, may I see Tom now?

STANTON
Yes.

They leave together.

WILLIE
(to Jack)
How much does the doc know?

JACK
About what?

WILLIE
Oh, you know what I'm talking about.

JACK
About what?

WILLIE
About Anne and me.

JACK
(after a pause)
He doesn't know a thing... not a

Jack turns and walks away.

DISSOLVE TO:

Anne has been waiting outside the hospital. She turns to 
Jack as he comes out the door.

ANNE
Jack, how is he?

JACK
The boy?

ANNE
Yes.

JACK
He'll live.

ANNE
Oh, thank God. How is --

JACK
Willie?

ANNE
He blames himself, doesn't he?

JACK
(as he walks down the 
street)
He'll find someone else to blame in 
a few days.

ANNE
(following him)
Oh, I tried to call here at the 
hospital, but I just...

They walk together, along the waterfront.

JACK
Anne... Anne, why did you do it?

ANNE
He wasn't like anybody I ever knew 
before.

JACK
You mean he wasn't like me.

ANNE
He wasn't like anybody I ever knew 
before. I love him, I guess. I guess 
that's the reason.

JACK
Everybody loves him.

ANNE
He wants to marry me.

JACK
Are you going to?

ANNE
Not now. It would hurt him. A divorce 
would hurt his career.

JACK
His career!

ANNE
Jack... Jack, what are you going to 
do? You can't leave him now. He needs 
you now more than he ever did before.

JACK
What Willie needs, Willie's got.

ANNE
You don't know him. You've known him 
all these years and you don't really 
know him at all.

JACK
What about Adam?

ANNE
Adam?

JACK
Well, you don't have to worry about 
him. If Adam finds out it'll be easy 
to prove a Stanton is no different 
than anybody else.
(gives her the papers 
on the Judge)
Just show him these. Willie was 
right... a man is conceived in sin 
and born in corruption. Even Judge 
Stanton. Show them to him, Anne. 
Change the picture of the world that 
Adam has in his head, just like our 
picture of it has been changed.

He grips her by the shoulders.

JACK
Wipe out everything he's ever believed 
in. It'll be good for him. There's 
no God but Willie Stark. I'm his 
prophet and you're his...
(pushes her aside, 
then feels sorry and 
walks after her)
Oh, Anne... Anne, I'm sorry. I didn't 
mean... Anne!

A policeman comes over.

POLICEMAN
What's going on here?

Jack catches up to Anne. He takes her arm and they start to 
walk back together.

JACK
It's all right, officer... we both 
work for Willie Stark.

Willie, Anne, Adam, and Jack inspect a construction site. 
There are newsmen and photographers present.

WILLIE
(to Adam)
Right over there, that's going to be 
the main building... fifteen stories 
high, like on the model. Over there, 
that's the laboratory. Finest 
technical equipment in the world.

STANTON
What are you trying to convince me 
of? I've taken the job.

WILLIE
Why?

STANTON
My reasons are my own. Why are you 
building a hospital?

WILLIE
To do some good for the people of 
the state.

STANTON
And get some votes.

WILLIE
Oh, there are lots of ways to get 
votes.

STANTON
Yes, I know... I won't stand for any 
interference.

WILLIE
I won't interfere. I may fire you, 
but I won't interfere.

STANTON
If that's a threat, you're wasting 
your time. You know what I think of 
your administration.

WILLIE
Yes, I know. I'll tell you what... 
You stay on your side of the fence; 
I'll stay on mine. Is that a deal?

They climb up onto the platform, where the newsmen gather 
around to take pictures. Willie and Adam shake hands.

Willie, Jack, and Sugar Boy are watching a newsreel, similar 
in style to the March of Time newsreels. A producer, his 
assistant, and two policemen are also in the room.

NARRATOR'S VOICE
And so the eyes of the entire nation 
are now focused upon Governor Willie 
Stark, an amazing phenomenon on the 
American political scene. The whole 
state is filled with his 
accomplishments -- each of them, of 
course, bearing his personal 
signature, to make sure that no one 
will ever forget who gave them to 
the state.

NARRATOR'S VOICE
This is the way the roads used to 
be. But there are those who claim 
that they were adequate for the 
people's needs, that you don't need 
a four- or six-lane highway for a 
horse and buggy.

The empty, untraversed STARK HIGHWAY.

NARRATOR'S VOICE
When Stark boasts of his great school 
system, his critics say: you can't 
go to school and work in the fields 
at the same time. And they question 
the benefit of these projects, 
charging that the need and the poverty 
of the people is as great as before.

Shot of large school. Camera cuts to men working in the field, 
then to ramshackle barn, and to a farmer walking across his 
rotted cornfield.

supported him.

Willie talking to the farmers.

He still keeps in touch with these 
people of the backwoods, making 
periodic trips to such places as 
Kanoma City, now famous as his 
birthplace...

NARRATOR'S VOICE
For those who say that Willie Stark 
is a man of destiny, there are others 
who claim that he is a man of evil, 
a man who cares neither for the people 
nor the state, but only for his own 
personal power and ambition.

Willie making a speech to a huge crowd of cheering people.

Willie inspecting his police force.

Willie pounding the desk in the state legislature.

NARRATOR'S VOICE
Obviously, these ambitions go far 
beyond the boundaries of the state. 
Just how far, only time will tell. 
Meanwhile, he is here...

Big close-up of Willie as he delivers a speech.

NARRATOR'S VOICE

is here to stay. Willie Stark: messiah 
or dictator?

The picture goes off and the lights in the room come on.

PRODUCER
How do you like it, Governor?

Willie stands and faces the producer.

WILLIE
How many theaters will this play in?

PRODUCER
All over the country.

WILLIE
Hear that, Jack. All over the country.

They start to leave. Willie stops for a moment.

WILLIE
Oh, there's one thing in there I 
didn't like too well. That messiah 
or dictator.

PRODUCER
That's our point of view, Governor. 
And that's the way it stands.

There is a silence. Willie's face is hard. Then he grins.

All right, all right, that's the way 
it stands... as of now.

Tom doesn't answer. Lucy offers her cheek to Willie. Sadie,

All right, give him a break. But if 
you got the facts, you got the facts. 
The truth is sufficient... just like 
it says in the Bible.

JACK
That's the way it's going to be.

WILLIE
All right, boy... I'll trust you. 
Where are you going?

JACK
(on his way out)
I'll be around.

Willie turns to go into his private office.

SADIE
Who else do you think he promised, 
Willie?

Willie shrugs.

SADIE
You'd be smart... play square with 
him. You're going to need people 
like us around.

WILLIE
(as he shuts his door)
Are you sure?

DISSOLVE TO:

MONTAGE: THE IMPEACHMENT

Willie's car speeding down a road.

Willie, with Lucy and Tom seated behind him, addressing crowd.

Willie speaking from the back of a train to a railroad station 
audience.

JACK
(voice over)
The chips were down, and Willie knew 
it. He was fighting for his life. He 
roared across the state making one 
speech after another. And all of 
them added up to the same thing... 
"It's not me they're after, it's 
you!"

Close-ups of Willie, speaking to the people.

JACK
(voice over)
Willie hollered foul. Willie knew if 
you hollered long enough, hard enough, 
and loud enough, people begin to 
believe you. Just in case they didn't, 
he organized spontaneous 
demonstrations.

Sign on back of a car: FIGHT WITH WILLIE

Crowds carrying signs: WIN WITH WILLIE

Willie talking on the telephone. Sadie listens.

WILLIE
Tell the boys to get the hicks out. 
Bring 'em in from the sticks, empty 
the pool halls. Turn 'em out. Turn 
the yokels out.

More men with WIN WITH WILLIE signs. Man directing crowd 
from top of bus. Other bus loads of people are seen, all of 
them bearing signs.

JACK
(voice over)
In case anyone hollered back, he 
organized spontaneous slugging. Willie 
pulled every trick he ever knew -- 
and added a few more.

Crowd looks on as two uniformed police drag a man away. 
Willie's car waiting. Two thugs talk things over with a man 
on his doorstep.

Willie discussing matters with a man in his office. Two cops 
stand with him.

Willie and Jack in the car. Sugar Boy drives. It is night. 
Sugar Boy drives fast, and has to swerve to avoid colliding 
with a truck.

JACK
Hey, Sugar!
(To Willie)
You'll never live to be impeached!

WILLIE
Boy, I'll live to be President...

Jack and Sugar wait in the car as Willie leans out the car 
window to talk to a senator. He offers the man a piece of 
paper.

WILLIE
I've got fourteen senators to vote 
against impeachment. If I win, you're 
out of politics.

SENATOR
(refuses to sign)
I'll do whatever the Judge says.

DISSOLVE TO:

Exterior: Highway, Night

Willie's car, as it races down the highway.

JACK
(voice over)
And always the trail led to one 
place... Burden's Landing... and the 
Judge.

Exterior: Ferry to Burden's Landing, Night

Willie's car coming across on the ferry.

DISSOLVE TO:

Exterior: Stanton Home, Night

As Willie's car stops and they all get out.

WILLIE
You sure you don't want me to go in 
with you?

JACK
I'm sure.

WILLIE
Well, hurry it up, boy. We've got 
places to go.

Jack goes into the house alone.

DISSOLVE TO:

Interior: Judge Stanton's Study, Night

Jack and the Judge are seated opposite each other.

JACK
Judge, I beg you, as a favor to 
yourself, to me... call up, release 
your votes.

JUDGE
I made a mistake once, Jack... when 
I resigned. It was too easy then, 
just resigning, pulling out. No, 
Jack, I've made my choice. I have 
nothing more to lose.

JACK
Judge, you know what Stark is capable 
of. Think it over. I'll leave now. 
I'll come back tomorrow and we'll 
talk about it again. You can give me 
your answer then.

The door opens and Willie and Sugar Boy enter.

WILLIE
I can't wait until tomorrow. I'm a 
very impatient man.

JACK
(rising)
I told you not to come in here.

WILLIE
(ignoring him)
Is it true, Judge, that you're behind 
the impeachment proceedings?

JUDGE
Yes, it's true.

Willie takes a seat in an easy chair.

WILLIE
I wanted to hear you say it with 
your own silver tongue.

JUDGE
Well, you've heard it. If that's all 
you came to hear you could have saved 
yourself a trip.

Willie picks up a decanter off the table.

WILLIE
Mind if I pour myself a drink? How 
about you, Judge, will you have one? 
You better... You're going to need 
it.

Jack and Judge Stanton remain standing, silently watching 
Willie.

WILLIE
What'd he say, Jack?

JACK
You'll get your answer tomorrow.

WILLIE
Are you kidding? Did you show it to 
him, or didn't you?

JUDGE
Show me what?

WILLIE
That's what I figured. Let's get 
down to cases, Judge. Do you remember 
a man with the name of Littlepaugh?

The Judge shakes his head. He doesn't.

WILLIE
Remember the Fortune Electric Company?

JUDGE
Of course. I was their counsel for 
over ten years.

WILLIE
Remember how you got the job?

JACK
How did you find out?

WILLIE
(hands the Judge some 
papers)
Do you remember how you got the job?

The Judge examines the papers.

WILLIE
You know, Judge, dirt's a funny thing. 
Some of it rubs off on everybody. 
How did you get the job, Judge? 
Blackmail?

JUDGE
(to Jack)
I swear I never even remembered his 
name. Isn't that remarkable, Jack? I 
never even remembered his name. It's 
all so long ago it's hard for me to 
realize it ever happened.

WILLIE
Yeah. But it did.

JUDGE
Yes, it did. But it's difficult for 
me to realize it.

JACK
For me too, Judge.

JUDGE
Thanks for that much.

WILLIE
Well, I guess you know what the next 
move is, don't you?

JUDGE
Yes, I do. Jack Burden. Willie Stark's 
hatchet man.

JACK
(to Willie)
I asked you... how did you find out?

JUDGE
This would never stand at law, not 
for a minute. It happened over twenty-
five years ago, and you could never 
get any testimony. Everybody is dead.

WILLIE
Everybody except you, Judge. You're 
alive. And people think you're a 
certain kind of man. And you just 
couldn't bear for people to think 
otherwise.

JUDGE
Ever since then I... I've done my 
duty. I... I'm responsible for many 
good things.
(looks at the papers 
again)
But I also did this.

WILLIE
Yes, yes, you did.

JACK
Judge, I beg of you, call and release 
your votes, for your sake.

JUDGE
You have tender sensibilities for a 
hatchet man.
(goes to the door)
Good night, gentlemen.

WILLIE
How about my answer?

JUDGE
You'll have it in the morning.

WILLIE
I want it tonight.

JUDGE
In the morning. Good night, gentlemen.

There is silence. Then the three men get up to go. The Judge 
closes the door behind them.

Interior: Stanton Hallway, Night

As the three men walk to the front door.

JACK
How did you find out?

WILLIE
We've got a lot to do. It's getting 
late, Jack. Let's get back to town.

JACK
You know we're through, don't you?

WILLIE
Aw, you don't mean that, boy.

The front door opens, and Adam and Anne come in.

STANTON
What are you doing here?

WILLIE
It's all right, doc. Just here to 
discuss some politics with the Judge.

STANTON
Oh, I see.
(starts upstairs)
Well, good night.

WILLIE
Good night.

JACK
(to Anne)
Did you give him --

WILLIE
Wait a minute, Jack --

JACK
Answer me. Did you give --

A shot is fired. They turn and rush into the Judge's study. 
They find the Judge face downward in his leather chair. Adam 
and Jack kneel beside him. Willie, holding on tightly to 
Anne's arm, stands in the doorway. Jack picks up the Judge's 
pistol and looks at Adam.

DISSOLVE TO:

Exterior: Stanton Home, Night

Jack comes out of the house, followed by Anne and Adam.

STANTON
Aren't you going back with him?

JACK
No.

STANTON
Why not? You belong with him. Jack, 
how could you have done it? When 
Anne brought me those papers she 
told me you promised not to tell 
Stark until...

JACK
Yeah. I know.
(walks away)
Well, I kept my promise.

Adam looks unbelievingly at Anne. She looks away.

STANTON
Anne? Anne?

FADE OUT

FADE IN:

Interior: Jack's Hotel Room (State Capital), Day

Jack looks out the window. A portable radio is blaring out 
the news.

ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
From all over the state they're 
streaming in. From the hill country 
and farms, the lumber camps... by 
boat, by train, by horse, and on 
foot. Willie Stark's army.

Through Jack's window we see the street blocked with cars 
and people, all headed for the State Capitol Building. Anne 
is in the crowd, trying to get across the street. Seeing 
Jack in the window, she pushes her way across and enters the 
hotel. He slams the window shut and comes back into the room.

ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
The state capital is filled with 
rumors, one of which is that Stark 
is planning to seize power by force. 
As commander of the state militia, 
he has --

Jack turns it off. He goes over to his bed and starts putting 
clothes into a valise. There is a knock on the door. He 
ignores it. Another knock.

JACK
Come in. The door's open.

Anne enters.

ANNE
Jack...

JACK
What do you want?

She starts to cry. He grabs her, pulling her face close to 
his.

JACK
(bitterly)
No, I want to see you cry.

He lets her go and she falls to the bed, sobbing.

JACK
Stop it!

ANNE
I called you. All afternoon I've 
been calling you.

JACK
I know. I was here.

ANNE
You've got to tell Adam. You've got 
to see him.

JACK
Tell him what?

ANNE
He knows about me and...

JACK
About you and Willie?

ANNE
(nods)
I tried to explain to him. I... I 
tried to explain to him that it wasn't 
the way he thought it was.

JACK
How was it, Anne? You tell me.

ANNE
He hit me, Jack. My own brother... 
he hit me.

JACK
Your brother is an old-fashioned 
man. He believes in his sister's 
honor. Me, I'm a modern man.
(slams clothes into 
the valise)
The twentieth-century type. I run.

ANNE
(rises)
I'm frightened, Jack.

JACK
For who? Your brother, or Willie?

ANNE
(quietly)
We're through.

JACK
Who's through with who?

ANNE
He called me this afternoon. He's 
going back to Lucy. He said it was 
better that way.

JACK
Better for who? Him.

ANNE
Both of us.

JACK
Did he tell you that too when he 
asked you to betray the Judge? At 
least I walked out on him.

ANNE
Oh Jack... help me, please, please. 
Adam's all I've got left now. Oh, 
Jack, if you ever loved me...

JACK
If I ever loved you.
(pause)
I'll go find Adam.

He takes up his coat.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXTERIOR: HOSPITAL SITE, DAY

A large billboard. It reads HERE ON THIS SITE WILL BE ERECTED 
THE GOVERNOR STARK HOSPITAL -- TO HEAL SICKNESS -- TO EASE 
PAIN -- FREE. NOT AS A CHARITY BUT AS A RIGHT. WILLIE STARK

Adam enters, looks at the sign, and walks on.

Exterior: Street Near Capitol Building, Day

Crowds of people headed toward the building, some with WIN 
WITH WILLIE signs. A marching band plays music for them.

Exterior: Capitol Building, Day

Crowd waiting outside the building. Mounted policemen keep 
them in line. From a large platform, loaded with people, 
comes the chant "We want Willie, we want Willie." Jack pushes 
his way through the people and speaks to a policeman standing 
guard on the Capitol steps.

COP
Where do you think you're going?
(recognizes Jack)
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't recognize 
you.

JACK
Do you know who Dr. Stanton is?

COP
Yes sir.

JACK
Did he try to come through here today?

COP
Haven't seen him, sir.

JACK
Well, can you check the other 
entrances?

2ND COP
There's no other entrances today. 
The other entrances are blocked off. 
Orders are to take no chances.

COP
If you care to come inside and wait, 
Mr. Burden, we can find you a seat.

JACK
No, thanks. I'll wait out here. If 
Dr. Stanton shows up, let me know. 
Pass the word along to the boys, 
will you?

COP
Yes sir.

Jack turns and looks at the large crowd. A voice from a public 
address loudspeaker begins to yell out commands to the crowd.

LOUDSPEAKER
All right now. Everybody... that 
means everybody... let's let Willie 
know we're here! All together: WE 
WANT WILLIE. WE WANT WILLIE.

The chant is picked up enthusiastically by the crowd.

Interior: State Legislature, Day

The speaker is trying to speak over the clamor of the 
chanting.

SPEAKER
We will first proceed to take the 
judgment of the senate on the question 
of the impeachment of the governor.

SENATOR
(rising)
Mr. Speaker, this is a farce to ask 
us to vote in the face of the kind 
of intimidation and pressure that 
has been exerted here in the past 
few weeks. Even that crowd outside, 
yelling on cue, is part of that 
pressure.

CROWD NOISE
We want Willie. We want Willie.

Willie gets up, and goes to the window.

Exterior: State Capitol, Day

The crowd, with Jack in the foreground. The crowd suddenly 
goes wild as they see Willie appear at the window. In the 
growing darkness he seems only a shadowy figure as he raises 
his hands to wave to the crowd.

We see various shots of people straining to get a little 
closer to the steps in order to see him better. Willie then 
turns and goes back into the room.

DISSOLVE TO:

Exterior: State Capitol, Day

The crowd again, still waiting. The camera pans upward to a 
loudspeaker.

ANNOUNCER
Attention, please. Attention, please. 
This is a special announcement from 
Willie Stark to you people out there. 
He doesn't want any one of you to 
leave...

The camera moves over the faces of the people listening.

ANNOUNCER
He wants you to stay in front of 
this state Capitol until the fight 
is over. If you want Willie Stark to 
win, stay where you are.

They cheer. Camera picks up Jack watching the crowd's 
reaction, then up to a plaque over the entrance to the Capitol 
Building. It reads THE PEOPLE'S WILL IS THE LAW OF THIS STATE -- 
GOVERNOR STARK.

ANNOUNCER
Do you hear me... stay where you 
are. Don't go away. Stay where you 
are. Don't go away.

DISSOLVE TO:

Exterior: State Capitol, Night

Newsmen, photographers stand about, bored. The crowd, every 
bit as large, is quiet but expectant. Everyone holds still 
as the announcer's voice is heard again.

ANNOUNCER
Attention, please. Attention, please. 
The balloting on the impeachment 
proceedings against Governor Stark 
has just ended. This is the result: 
Willie Stark has won.

The crowd explodes. People break through the police barriers. 
Mounted policemen ride in quickly to prevent a riot. Camera 
picks up Anne in the crowd, trying to push through.

Jack stands on the steps of the Capitol, watching it all. 
Suddenly Willie appears at the top of the steps, followed by 
Sugar Boy. Sadie, Duffy, Pillsbury follow close behind. Willie 
grabs hold of the mike and addresses the suddenly hushed 
crowd.

WILLIE
They tried to ruin me. But they are 
ruined. They tried to ruin me because 
they did not like what I have done. 
Do you like what I have done?

Loud applause, and cries of "yes."

WILLIE
Remember, it's not I who have won, 
but you. Your will is my strength, 
and your need is my justice, and I 
shall live in your right and your 
will. And if any man tries to stop 
me from fulfilling that right and 
that will, I'll break him. I'll break 
him with my bare hands. For I have 
the strength of many.

Having finished, he waves at them all. Then he notices Jack 
and comes down the steps to greet him.

WILLIE
Hello, Jack boy, I'm glad you're 
here. I knew you'd come back.

He walks back up the steps, his arm around Jack's shoulders. 
They start to go into the building that way when Willie sees 
someone. He smiles and puts out his hand.

WILLIE
Oh, doctor, I'm very glad to see 
you.

Adam is seen, waiting at the entrance of the building. Before 
Willie has taken a step Adam fires several shots into him. 
Willie falls to the ground and Sugar Boy whips out his pistol 
and fires at Adam. Three policemen with tommy guns open fire, 
shooting into Adam's already fallen body. Then they turn and 
point their guns at the mob of people rushing toward Willie, 
forcing them back.

COP
Stand back, everybody. Stand back.

Sugar Boy kneels beside Willie. Sadie stands against a pillar, 
looking down on him.

SUGAR BOY
(nearly crying)
D-does it hurt m-much, boss? D-d-
does it hurt much?

Jack looks up to see Anne struggling through the screaming 
mob to get to Adam. She looks at Adam for a moment, then 
turns away.

JACK
Anne, Anne... Where are you going?

She doesn't answer, only walks away. He runs after her and 
catches hold of her arm.

ANNE
I don't know. Leave me alone.

JACK
To do what?

ANNE
I don't care.

JACK
No, that's too easy.

ANNE
I don't know, I don't know, I don't 
know.

JACK
I do.

ANNE
Leave me alone, please.

JACK
No, no more.

ANNE
He's dead.

JACK
We're alive.

ANNE
My brother's dead.

JACK
We've got to go on living.

ANNE
How?

JACK
So that Adam's death has meaning, so 
that it wasn't wasted. Anne, our 
life has to give his death meaning. 
Don't you see that? Look at those 
people...

He turns her around so that she can see the crowds still 
struggling to get a look at Willie.

JACK
Look at them! They still believe in 
him. And we've got to make them see 
Willie the way Adam saw him, or 
there's no meaning in anything... 
anything.

A policeman approaches.

POLICEMAN
Mr. Burden... the governor's asking 
for you. You better hurry. He's going 
fast.

JACK
(to Anne)
Will you wait here?

No reply.

JACK
Will you wait here?

She nods her head slowly. Jack walks through the building to 
the pillar against which Willie has been propped. Sugar Boy 
is still beside him. He stands behind Sadie and Duffy, looking 
down at Willie.

WILLIE
It could have been the whole world, 
Willie Stark. The whole world... 
Willie Stark. Why did he do it to 
me... Willie Stark? Why?

His head droops to the side and he dies.

INT. ENTRANCE ROOM TO VAULTS - MED. SHOT

Of the inside of a massive vault door, made impressive by 
the shining, finely cut steel bolts and the many other 
intricate-looking instruments which adorn it.

CAMERA PANS UP to a clock overhead which registers 9:03.

A group of young men, paying tellers, are impatiently 
watching a teller struggle with the lock that will admit 
them to the vault.

TELLER
Come on, come on, Oscar, what are 
we waiting for?

2ND TELLER
What's the matter? Can't you find 
it?

3RD TELLER
Sneak up on it, boy!

4TH TELLER
Oscar, come on!

Say, if it had lipstick on it, 
he'd find it!

They all laugh, as Oscar finds the combination.

OSCAR
Almonds to you![1] Almonds!

TELLERS
Now, now, Oscar - not almonds!

The CAMERA MOVES WITH THEM as they pass through the first 
portal.

CHARLIE
Nine o'clock and all is lousy!

1ST TELLER
Yes, I spend half of my life waiting 
for these time clocks to open. 
Say, where's Matt?

CHARLIE
Probably upstairs thinking up that 
daily joke.

2ND TELLER
That guy kills me with his

3RD TELLER

on a frozen face. Let's not smile.

They ad-lib agreement.

1ST TELLER
Shhh! Nix! Here he comes 

7. MED. SHOT

CAMERA PICKS UP Matt Brown, the chief teller, as he strides 
briskly in and begins turning the combination dial to the 
main vault. He is about twenty-six, a clean-looking, 
personable youngster. Several of the tellers are standing 
close to him, looking on.

MATT
How are you doing slaves?

TELLERS
Hello, Matt. How're you Matt?

Matt begins to work the combination of the main lock.

MATT
(with his back to 
them)
Say, did you boys ever hear the 
story of the pawnbroker with the 
glass eye?

1ST TELLER
No Matt, what is the story about 
the pawnbroker with the glass eye?

MATT
(as he continues to 
fiddle with the 
lock)
Well, I'll tell you. A fellow went 
into this shop to pawn his watch. 
The pawnbroker said, "I'll give 
you $50 for it, if you can tell me 
which is my glass eye." The fellow 
said, "All right, I'll do that. 
It's the right one." The pawnbroker 
said, "That's correct. But how did 
you know it was the right one?" 
The fellow said, "well, it's got 
more sympathy than the other one."

He turns, expecting their laugh, but is confronted by stone 
faces.

MATT
Sympathy! You know, the right one 
had more sympathy than the other 
one!

1ST TELLER
What's the matter? Can't you get 
this thing open?

Matt stares in disbelief, then gets the joke.

MATT
(contemptuously)
Six reasons why banks fail!

This cracks them all up, as a uniformed officer, who has 
been standing by, works a lever attached to the floor, 
which lowers a section of the floor, directly in front of 
the vault. This permits the vault door, which is sunk below 
the floor level, to swing open.

TELLERS
(ad-libbing)
I love your jokes, Matt! They're 
so entertaining! A very funny man!

8. MED. SHOT

Matt opens the inside door, made up of perpendicular steel 
bars. The tellers scurry into the cavernous-looking 
interior. Someone

snaps on a light. CAMERA TRUCKS UP TO VAULT.

The back walls of the vault are lined with steel cabinets 
divided into many small compartments. On one side is a 
wall safe which is also opened by a combination and which 
contains the surplus cash carried by the bank. Matt is in 
charge of this. All around the room are numerous hand trucks - 
one for every teller. These trucks contain the cash in the 
charge of the individual tellers. While the tellers in the 
b.g. obtain their keys and open the drawers of their trucks, 
Matt examines the time clock which is attached to the inside 
of the vault door.

alarm box to the left of the doorway. He leans over to 
throw off the burglar alarm switch.

The handle of the switch points in the direction of a sign 
reading ON. Matt's hand comes into the scene and throws 
the switch up toward a sign reading OFF. This is done with 
no comment, it being a routine matter with Matt.

MATT
Come on, white collars. The day's 
started!

11. MED. SHOT

As the tellers file out with their trucks. Before they do, 
however, each one signs the cashbook. One or two exit 
silently.

CLOSE SHOT - MATT

As one of the tellers comes into scene. Matt examines the 
cashbook.

MATT
You're carrying too much money on 
you, Hank. You better turn some in 
tonight.

TELLER
(as he goes)
Okay, Matt.

He exits out of scene.

MATT
How are you fixed?

TELLER
I'm okay, Matt.

MATT
(to another teller)
You've got enough?

2ND TELLER
I'll be all right.

Charlie, the last man, comes up.

CHARLIE
Say Matt, I'll have to have some 
money for those Manville payrolls.

MATT
How much?

CHARLIE
About twenty-four thousand.

MATT
(counting out money)
It was more than that last week.

CHARLIE
Yeah.

MATT
Here's twenty-five thousand.

He hands Charlie four stacks of bills. As Charlie is signing 
the cash book, Matt speaks:

MATT
Say, do me a favor, will you 
Charlie?

CHARLIE
Yeah.

MATT
Let me have ten bucks?

CHARLIE
(aghast)
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, 
I'd quit.

MATT
Charlie!

CHARLIE
Yeah?

Charlie starts out. Matt follows him.

13. OUTSIDE OF VAULT - MED. CLOSE SHOT

As Charlie comes out, followed by Matt. CAMERA TRUCKS ALONG 
WITH THEM as they walk.

MATT
(as they walk)
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - 
on the level I will. Give a guy a 
break, will you? I've got to get 
it back in my account. If Helen 
ever finds out that I 

CHARLIE
(unsympathetically)
Baby, I can't give you anything 
but love...

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MAIN FLOOR OF BANK - BACKSTAGE

CAMERA TRUCKS with them as Charlie pushes his truck forward 
and Matt walks alongside of him. En route, CAMERA TAKES IN 
ATMOSPHERIC SHOTS of the general activity backstage of the 
bank.

Male and female clerks stand around at various angles, 
checking away at adding machines. Several are assisted by 
someone who calls off figures to them as they record it on 
machines. We hear these figures read in a monotone as we 
pass them.

Matt is still trying to pry the ten dollars loose from 
Charlie.

MATT
Now listen Charlie. I'll give you 
an I.O.U. I'll give you a note, 
I'll pay your mortgage, it's a 
matter of life and death 

Ad-lib conversations from the other clerks distract his 
attention.

CHARLIE
Whose death?

MATT
It'll be yours if you don't kick 
in with that ten bucks.

CHARLIE
Say pal, did you ever hear of a 
Depression?

MATT
Aw, nerts!

Charlie arrives at his cage. CAMERA STOPS with them.

CHARLIE
Come over and see us sometime.

CAMERA CONTINUES TO FOLLOW Matt as he continues on to his 
cage, muttering half to himself.

MATT
I'm not asking you to pay off the 
Depression. I'm only asking you 
for ten bucks!

Another teller is busy in the cage next to him. Matt 
addresses him, referring to Charlie.

MATT
That mug reminds me of a guy with 
his second dollar.

TELLER
Yeah, what did he do with his first 
one?

MATT
Bought himself a pocketbook!

The teller laughs heartily.

15. MED. SHOT

THE CAMERA PICKS UP Helen as she crosses the main floor of 
the bank, reaches Matt's teller window and pushes it open.

MATT
Hello, Helen!

HELEN
(conspiratorially)
Matt, come here!

MATT
Why?

HELEN
Come here, honey!

He leans over, and she gives him a quick kiss.

MATT
Hey, look out, somebody's likely 
to see us!

HELEN
(already walking 
away)
Oh, is that so?

She quickly kisses him again, crosses back, and takes the 
grand stairs up to the outer office of the bank president 
as Matt watches with a grin.

INT. MAIN FLOOR OF BANK - FULL SHOT

Just then, a group of five or six important-looking men 
enter scene on the way to the conference room. One of the 
men looks towards Helen's desk.

17. MED. SHOT

On Helen and a secretary standing next to her.

SECRETARY
(to Helen)
Oh, oh. Look who's here.

18. MED. SHOT

The other clerks and tellers, noticing the newcomers as 
they file past.

TELLER
Hey, psst!

OSCAR
Oh, oh. Five ill winds.

TELLER
(standing next to 
Oscar)
And blowing no good for the old 
man, either.

19. CLOSER SHOT ON HELEN'S DESK

Shooting toward Helen.

HELEN
(acidly)
The four-and-a-half horsemen.

GIRL
What are they doing here? There's 
no board meeting today.

HELEN
Search me.

By this time, the important group of men have reached Helen, 
and are passing her by, with perfunctory nods.

CLARK
(the most important 
of the important-
looking men; to 
Helen)
Mr. Dickson in yet?

HELEN
Not yet, Mr. Clark.

CLARK
When he comes in, tell him we're 
waiting for him in the board room.

HELEN
Yes, sir.

CLARK
And tell him not to delay.

HELEN
Yes, sir.

The group of men file through the board room door, and out 
of sight.

GIRL
(to Helen)
Looks like trouble for your boss.

HELEN
Takes more than two tons of 
directors to make trouble for my 
boss.

GIRL
(as she turns to go)
Sez you!

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MED. SHOT

Taking in all of room. The directors are all here, and 
some sit around a long, narrow mahogany table. Clark, the 
sour-faced old bird we saw previously talking to Helen, 
paces back and forth agitatedly.

CLARK
I've sent for the cashier, 
gentlemen. He has a list of the 
loans that Dickson made last month.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - CLARK

As he stops in his pacing a moment and addresses the 
directors further:

CLARK
And as I told you at breakfast, it 
is time we did something about it.

CLOSE SHOT - SCHULTZ

In thorough accord with Clark's violent attitude is Schultz, 
a German, whose instinctive conservatism rebels against 
Dickson's liberal banking methods.

SCHULTZ
Mr. Clark's right. Dickson will 
ruin this bank if we don't stop 
him.

AMES
(another conservative 
stalwart)
Looks to me as if we're in hot 
water already.

A very dignified but meek little old man, Jonathan Ives, 
tries horning in:

IVES
(feeble-voiced)
Gentlemen, I was just wondering 

23. MED. SHOT

As another of the directors, O'Brien, a large, bull-faced, 
thunderous-voiced contractor, rises to Dickson's defense. 
(O'Brien is always filing his nails, even while he talks.)

O'BRIEN
Personally, I think you're getting 
panic-stricken about nothing. 
Dickson's all right.

CLARK
(interrupting)
Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured 
paper than any other institution 
in the city. We're fools to tolerate 
it.

SCHULTZ
That's what I say. And the only 
way to end it is to get Dickson 
out.

CLOSE SHOT - O'BRIEN

He looks toward Schultz.

O'BRIEN
Don't make me laugh, Schultz!

MED. CLOSE SHOT - CLARK

CLARK
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he 
must agree to this merger with New 
York Trust 

O'BRIEN
What good will that do?

CLARK
What good will that do?  Why, it 
will take control away from him. 
We'll put somebody else in charge, 
call in all doubtful loans, and be 
on safe ground again. That's what 
good it will do!

MED. CLOSE SHOT

Including Ives in scene with Clark and O'Brien. Ives is 
seated, O'Brien and Clark standing by table. Ives tries to 
speak again.

IVES
It has just occurred to me 

O'BRIEN
(interrupting)
You're wasting your time, I tell 
you. Dickson won't stand for it.

CLARK
He'll stand for it, if I have 
anything to say about it.

Just then they hear door open, and they all look towards 
door leading thru to main floor.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - CLUETT

As he shuts the door behind him. He is immaculately groomed, 
obviously cuts quite a dash with the women. He looks off 
toward the men as Clark's voice comes in:

CLARK'S VOICE
Ah - come in, Cluett.

CAMERA PANS WITH CLUETT as he comes forward and puts a 
paper on the table before Clark.

CLUETT
Here's the list.

CLARK
Yes, thank you.

CLUETT
Anything else?

CLARK
No. Nothing.

Cluett exits toward door again. Clark picks up the list 
and looks at it. Then he addresses the other men:

CLARK
Look at this. Just look at this. 
It's outrageous. Henry Moore - 
thirty-six thousand. Manny Goldberg -
eighty-five hundred. Tony Consero -
fifty-six thousand dollars. Joseph 
McDonald - eighteen thousand. Alvin 
Jones - sixty-six thousand dollars 
to a hotel that's on its last legs. 
I tell you, people get loans in 
this bank that couldn't borrow 
five cents anywhere else.

28. WIDER ANGLE

As the other men group around the loan list, which Clark 
has put back down on the table. They all scrutinize it 
carefully.

SCHULTZ
(to the men at large)
And on what? "Hunches," he calls 
it.

AMES
Some day he'll get a "hunch" about 
a man and give the bank away.

CLARK
He's almost done that already. Our 
chief teller, Matt Brown, is an 
example of that. He breaks into 
Dickson's house, holds him up, and 
the next day gets a job in the 
bank.

IVES
Well, as far as I'm concerned 

SCHULTZ
A boy who should be in jail, 
handling a bank's cash!

CUT TO:

INT. MAIN FLOOR OF BANK - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Shooting toward Matt, inside the teller's cage, busily 
counting the money he is getting ready for Charlie.

Helen is outside the cage.

30. CLOSE SHOT

Shooting toward Helen.

HELEN
(skeptically)
What did you do with it?

MATT
With what?

HELEN
The ten dollars.

MATT
(quickly)
Oh, ten dollars 

HELEN
Yes.

MATT
(catches himself in 
time)
A friend of mine - yeah, really - 
his mother was terribly sick and 
she was dying, would you believe 
it?

31. CLOSE SHOT

Shooting toward Matt.

AS SHE INTERRUPTS HIM:

HELEN
No.

MATT
Oh, you think I'm lying?

HELEN
Yes.

MATT
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget 
you called me a liar.

HELEN
Oh, Matt.

He reaches forward and takes her hands.

MATT
Oh honey, why don't we get married? 
Then you can handle it all.

Just then Oscar enters the scene, en route somewhere. He 
stops beside Matt, notices he and Helen are holding hands.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

As Helen and Matt separate guiltily.

OSCAR
Say, Matt! Matt! Did you hear the 
news?

MATT
No, what?

OSCAR
Pardon me. All the big shots are 
in a huddle, and it looks like 
Dickson's out on his ear.

Helen and Matt react to this piece of news. They look at 
one another. Apparently, it will have a definite effect on 
their lives.

MATT
(to Oscar)
Oh, you're kidding me, aren't you?

OSCAR
No, I'm not kidding. Everybody's 
talking about it. Ask her.

HELEN
I haven't heard about it.

OSCAR
Sure, everybody's talking about 
it.

CLOSE UP - MATT

As he speaks sadly.

MATT
If that's on the level, there goes 
my assistant cashier's job.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

Taking the three in.

OSCAR
Well, I just thought I'd drop by 
and cheer you up a bit.

As he turns to go out of scene, he looks at Matt.

OSCAR
I'll be seeing you, Matt - in the 
breadline.

CUT TO:

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM MED. - SHOT

The men are all gathered around the table now. Apparently, 
they have been discussing ways and means of ousting Dickson.

As we cut to this scene, Ives is pouring himself a glass 
of water.

IVES
That ham I had this morning was 
very salty 

CLOSER SHOT ON THE GROUP

CLARK
Gentlemen, let's get organized 
before Dickson gets here. Schultz, 
can I count on you?

37. CLOSE SHOT
On Schultz, who is seated next to 
Clark.

SCHULTZ
Absolutely.

CLARK
What about you, Ames?

38. CLOSE SHOT

On Ames, who is seated next to Schultz.

AMES
That's the way I feel about it.

CLARK
Ives, how about you?

39. CLOSE SHOT

IVES
Well, the way I look at it, it 
seems that 

CLARK
(interrupting)
All right. O'Brien?

40. CLOSE SHOT
At other end of table, where O'Brien 
is.

O'BRIEN
Well, you've got an awful fight on 
your hands. That's all I've got to 
say.

41. CLOSE SHOT

On Clark, determined.

CLARK
Gentlemen, I think it's time that 
we do fight.

CUT TO:

INT. MAIN FLOOR OF BANK - FULL SHOT

The outer offices of the bank are in this shot. A spacious 
stretch of desks occupied by clerks and junior officers, 
all busily at work.

A wizened old doorman is greeting clerks as they arrive.

CLERK
(passing by)
Hello, Gardiner.

GARDINER
Good morning. You're on time this 
morning. It's about time.

We see Dickson, looming in the doorway, for the first time.

43. CLOSE SHOT

As Dickson stops to speak to the doorman. Dickson is a man 
of about fifty, whose looks belie his years. There is a 
robustness and virility about him that is compelling. His 
very walk radiates power.

He now puts his hand on the old man's shoulder.

GARDINER
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.

DICKSON
John, how's your wife this morning?

GARDINER
(looking up, worship 
in his eyes)
Much better this morning, thank 
you.

DICKSON
Got a handkerchief?

Gardiner hurriedly produces a handkerchief, and starts to 
blow his nose.

GARDINER
Excuse me 

DICKSON
Wait a minute.
(he takes the 
handkerchief, and 
polishes the brass 
on Gardiner's 
uniform)
How do you feel this morning?

GARDINER
I'm feeling fine this morning.

DICKSON
That makes it unanimous. I feel 
all right too.

GARDINER
Thank you!

AS DICKSON EXITS FROM SCENE:

CUT TO:

TRUCKING SHOT WITH DICKSON

The smile on his face disappears as he sees something which 
annoys him.

DICKSON
(sternly)
Oh, Carter!

A young man looks up quickly. He is smoking a cigarette.

CARTER
Yes sir?

DICKSON
You know the rules about smoking...

Carter quickly crushes out the cigarette. Even as he does 
so, Dickson reaches into his pocket and flips Carter a 
fresh one, which Carter pockets for later.

CARTER
Thank you, sir.

Now Dickson passes Matt's cage.

DICKSON
(catching Matt's 
attention)
Oh, Matt!

Matt looks up. Dickson tosses him a wink, and Matt winks 
back.

Dickson walks on towards his office. CAMERA TRUCKS AHEAD 
OF HIM. On the way he is greeted by his employees.

AD-LIB FROM EMPLOYEES
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. Etc., 
etc.

DICKSON
(pleasantly)
Morning. Good morning 

He is joined by Bill Saunders, a friend of his. Bill walks 
along with Dickson.

BILL
Hello, Tom.

DICKSON
(firmly, but 
pleasantly)
You here again? What do you want?

He does not stop. Continues his walk toward his office. 
Bill along-side of him.

BILL
(smiling)
What do you suppose anybody wants? 
Money, money, money!

DICKSON
Listen, I told you I wasn't 
interested in that deal, didn't I?

BILL
I want to know why .

Dickson notices a man, a janitor without a uniform, passing 
by.

DICKSON
(to the man)
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?

JANITOR
I haven't any.

DICKSON
You haven't got a uniform?

JANITOR
No, sir.

DICKSON
My goodness, you ought to have a 
uniform. How much does one cost?

JANITOR
Why, I don't know.

DICKSON
You see Sampson. Tell him I sent 
you. You've got to have a uniform.

The man exits scene. Bill picks up the conversation where 
he left off.

BILL
Tom, I never had trouble getting 
credit from you before. When I was 
flat broke you gave me all the 
money I wanted. Now I come to you 
with a swell deal, and the greatest 

DICKSON
(interrupting)
I'll tell you why. I don't like 
the crowd you're mixed up with.
(softening)
Personally, you can have all the 
credit you want. But for that deal - 
not a cent.

BILL
But listen, Tom, I 

They have now reached the anteroom of Dickson's private 
chamber, where Helen sits at her desk.

INT. DICKSON'S OUTER OFFICE - MED. CLOSE SHOT

As Dickson comes up to Helen at her desk. A lady sits 
nearby. Dickson notices her.

DICKSON
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.

MRS. PEMBROKE
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.

DICKSON
Got my letter?

MRS. PEMBROKE
Yes, thank you.

DICKSON
Hello, Helen.

HELEN
Good morning.

DICKSON
Helen, you're becoming more 
beautiful every day. What are we 
going to do about it?

HELEN
I don't know.

DICKSON
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice 
the bank. When are you and Matt 
going to get married?

HELEN
(awkwardly)
Why - well, I 

DICKSON
Ummm. Stalling, eh?
(changing tone, 
professionally)
Anything new?

HELEN
Why, the directors are waiting for 
you in the board room.

DICKSON
Directors, eh? Long faces?

He gestures accordingly.

HELEN
(she trumps his 
gesture)
Longer.

DICKSON
(half-under his 
breath)
I haven't got any new stories for 
them this morning, either.

Mrs. Pembroke has been standing by, waiting to get a word 
in edgewise. CAMERA PANS SLIGHTLY with him to take in the 
lady:

MRS. PEMBROKE
Mr. Dickson?

DICKSON
Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. 
Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's 
going to take care of that mortgage 
for you . . .

During this speech the phone bell rings.

46. MEDIUM SHOT

As Helen picks up the phone and quietly answers it. Bill 
Saunders is standing nearby, still waiting to talk to 
Dickson again.

HELEN
(into phone)
Hello . . .
(she turns to Dickson)
Mrs. Dickson on the phone.

Dickson comes over to the desk and as he picks up the 
receiver, he looks toward Mrs. Pembroke.

DICKSON
(to Mrs. Pembroke)
You'd better hurry over there. 
He's waiting for you.
(then into phone)
Hello, dear . . .

CLOSE SHOT - DICKSON

AS HE CONTINUES, INTO PHONE:

DICKSON
Where are you? . . . Sure, well, 
come on down right away. Huh? . . 
. Yes, of course I remember. It's 
tonight.
(smiles)
See what a social hound I'm 
becoming! . . . All right, goodbye, 
dear.

He hangs up. Mrs. Pembroke is waiting for him to finish. 
She has apparently been disappointed in the news he has 
for her.

MRS. PEMBROKE
But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you 
were going to take care of the 
mortgage. I only want ten thousand. 
The property is worth sixty.

DICKSON
(ill-at-ease)
Mr. Schaffer will take good care 
of you. He'll give you fifteen - 
maybe twenty . . .

MED. CLOSE SHOT

He continues talking to the lady, trying to get rid of 
her.

DICKSON
Better hurry now. Goodbye. Good 
luck to you!

Mrs. Pembroke, bewildered, starts to leave.

MRS. PEMBROKE
(muttering)
Thank you.

CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as Mrs. Pembroke leaves.

DICKSON
(to Helen)
Oh, if Mrs. Dickson comes in, will 
you tell her to see Cluett if she 
needs any money?

Bill Saunders is still waiting. He corners Dickson.

BILL
What's the idea of turning her 
down? It sounds like a perfectly 
safe investment.

DICKSON
She's a widow. I don't like taking 
mortgages from widows.

BILL
(puzzled)
Why not?

CLOSE SHOT OF THE TWO

Shooting toward Dickson.

DICKSON
If she can't pay, I'll have to 
foreclose, won't I?

BILL
(dumbly)
Yes - sure 

DICKSON
(mimicking him)
Yeah - sure!

He turns to address a man below - the janitor without a 
uniform.

DICKSON
Oh, make that uniform blue.

JANITOR
Yes, sir.

Abruptly, he heads for the board room. Bill is still baffled 
by Dickson's queer reasoning. Suddenly, it dawns on him. 
He shakes his head admiringly.

CUT TO:

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MED. SHOT

Dickson enters.

DICKSON
(blithely; as he 
counts the board 
members present)
One - two - three - four - five. 
Seven more and you'd have a jury!

He grabs a walking cane and wields it like a golf putter.

DICKSON
Well, it's a nice morning, 
gentlemen. How about two foursomes 
of golf?

IVES
(eagerly)
Oh, I say, that would be . . .

Ives's voice trails off as he realizes Clark is scowling 
at him.

DICKSON
(undeterred; still 
practicing his 
golf swing)
Say, you know, I found out something 
yesterday about hitting a golf 
ball. You've got to hit with the 
left hand, and from the inside 
out, it's the only way you can hit 
anything 

CLARK
(huffy)
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would 
like to have a little of your very 
valuable time here at the bank 
this morning, if you don't mind.

DICKSON
Oh, you would, eh?  All right. If 
it's more important than golf, go 
ahead. What's on your mind?

CUT TO:

INT. LOBBY OF BANK - LONG SHOT

Shooting from one end of the lobby toward the front door. 
Depositors are scattered all over the place. Some at the 
windows. Some at the writing tables. Others sitting inside 
the railing, talking to junior executives. The scene is 
peaceful, though very active.

CAMERA STARTS TRUCKING FORWARD, passing en route, the 
different types of individuals who frequent the bank. People 
from all walks of life. CAMERA TRAVELS SLOWLY, picking up 
following little scenes.

TELLER
(at window)
The check is no good.

SADIE (A FEMALE CUSTOMER)
What?

CLERK
The check is no good. The man has 
no account here.

SADIE
Holy mackerel! I've been robbed.

CLERK
I'm sorry, madam.

SADIE
So am I. And don't call me madam!

CAMERA NEXT PICKS UP an elderly lady talking to a bank 
guard.

GUARD
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your 
money here.

LADY
Is it safe?

GUARD
Absolutely.

LADY
It's his life insurance money, you 
know.

BANK GUARD
That's all right. You come with 
me, and I'll show you where to 
deposit your money.

CAMERA GOES PAST and now singles out three men who are 
coming forward. One glance and we know they are here for 
no kosher reason.

They are typical gangster types. One of them, the leader, 
is dressed in everything but the kitchen sink.  Light 
fedora, stiff shirt and collar with stripes running 
perpendicularly. Flashy gray suit - spats - and walking 
stick. The other two are just tough hombres, but dressed 
to kill.

As they walk toward camera, they glance around the bank 
with a professional casualness, but obviously very much 
impressed. Their eyes rove around the place and finally 
land on some object where they stop.

CUT TO:

CLOSEUP - CHARLIE

As he quickly counts out several thousand dollars in bills.

CUT TO:

53. CLOSE SHOT - THREE RACKETEERS

Their eyes glisten. Their mouths water, as they watch 
Charlie off scene.

CUT TO:

54. MEDIUM SHOT

Inside the railing. Cluett emerges from his office and 
starts forward, business-like, when he suddenly stops in 
his tracks.

CLOSEUP - CLUETT

He stares off at the racketeers. A look of fright comes 
into his eyes. His impulse is to turn back.

CLOSE GROUP SHOT

The three gangsters. A quick flash. Their eyes light on 
Cluett off scene, and they glare menacingly at him.

LEADER
There he is! Good morning!

MED. CLOSE SHOT - CLUETT

He changes his mind about avoiding them. His face breaks 
into a feeble smile of affability as he walks toward them. 
CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he approaches the three men, his 
hand outstretched in forced amiability.

CLUETT
(shaking)
Good morning! Who do you want to 
see?

The gangsters shake hands with him, their expressions 
remaining unchanged, which adds immeasurably to Cluett's 
discomfort.

LEADER
(flatly)
You.

1ST GANGSTER
(drawling)
Yeah. We wanna talk to you about a 
big deal.

There is a sinister significance in the manner in which he 
emphasizes "a big deal." Cluett is perceptibly ill-at-ease.

CLUETT
(uncertainly - sickly 
smile)
Oh, yes. Well, come right this 
way.

He opens the swinging gate in front of him, permitting the 
three racketeers to enter. They start for Cluett's office.

INT. ANTE ROOM DICKSON'S OFFICE - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Helen sits at her typewriter near a railing, overlooking 
the bank below. Another girl stands by her, both are staring 
off scene.

Cluett and the three gangsters going into Cluett's office.

INT. ANTE ROOM OF DICKSON'S OFFICE - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Helen and other secretary.

HELEN
Hey Pat, come here! Look!

SECRETARY
(to Helen)
That's Dude Finlay, all right - 
I've seen his picture in the papers 
hundreds of times.

HELEN
I wonder what he's doing with Mr. 
Cluett.

SECRETARY
(still staring - 
thrilled - 
shuddering)
Gee, I'm scared. He's one of the 
toughest gangsters in town.

CUT TO:

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MED. LONG SHOT

Shooting down the length of the table. The men are all 
sitting around the large table. Dickson is on his feet.

DICKSON
(firmly)
Gentlemen, you're only wasting 
your time. There'll be no merger.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

As Dickson continues.

DICKSON
(the injustice kills 
him)
Why should I turn this bank over 
to anybody else?  I've worked twenty-
five years night and day to build 
it up, and now you're asking me to 
dump it into somebody's lap 
(with finality)
Nothing doing!

Schultz, who is seated near Dickson, looks up at him:

SCHULTZ
You can make a handsome profit on 
your stock.

DICKSON
I'm not interested in profits. I'm 
interested in the bank. In the 
depositors. They're my friends. 
They're looking to me for 
protection, and I'm not walking 
out on them.

Clark and O'Brien, also seated around close to Dickson.

CLARK
How are you protecting your 
depositors? By making a lot of 
idiotic loans!

O'BRIEN
(admonishing him)
Take it easy, Clark.

Ives, seated next to Schultz, becomes alarmed.

IVES
(still trying)
My dear friends . . .

DICKSON
(unruffled, paying 
no attention to 
Ives)
It's all right. Let him go ahead. 
Let him speak his piece. I like 
it. Go on.

CLARK
All right. I'll speak my piece. 
Dickson, you've got to change your 
policy.

63. CLOSER SHOT

As Dickson retorts:

DICKSON
What's the matter with my policy? 
How many losses has this bank taken 
in the last twenty-five years?
(he looks around - 
silence)
I'll tell you. Not a single one!
(defiantly)
What's wrong with that kind of 
banking?

CLARK
(mumbles disdainfully)
Just pure luck!

64. CLOSE SHOT
Ames, seated beyond Ives, now speaks 
up:

AMES
Conditions have changed. These are 
precarious times. Banks today have 
got to be careful. And you've been 
more liberal than ever.

Dickson's voice comes in over scene:

DICKSON'S VOICE
Yes, and I'm going to continue to 
be liberal . . .

CLOSEUP - DICKSON

AS HE CONTINUES:

DICKSON
The trouble with this country today 
is there's too much hoarded cash. 
Idle money is no good to industry. 
Where is all the money today?  In 
the banks, vaults, socks, old tin 
cans, buried in the ground! I tell 
you, we've got to get the money in 
circulation before you'll get this 
country back to prosperity.

CLOSE SHOT - CLARK

CLARK
Who are we going to give it to? 
Men like Jones?  Last week you 
made him an extra loan of fifty 
thousand dollars. Do you call that 
intelligent banking?

67. CLOSE SHOT - SCHULTZ AND DICKSON

SCHULTZ
He can't pay his bills. How do you 
expect him to pay us?

DICKSON
That's a fair question, Schultz. 
Now let's see how bad a risk Jones 
is. What's his history? He's been 
a successful business man for thirty-
five years. Two years ago business 
started falling off. Today Jones 
needs money, and if he doesn't get 
it, he goes into bankruptcy and 
throws nine hundred men out of 
work. Answer - unemployment.

CLOSEUP - O'BRIEN

As he listens intently, Dickson's voice coming in:

DICKSON'S VOICE
It also means his creditors aren't 
paid. They're in trouble. They go 
to banks and are turned down . . . 
more bankruptcies . . .

CLOSEUP - DICKSON

AS HE CONTINUES:

DICKSON
It's a vicious circle, my friends, 
and the only place to cure it is 
right here at the source. Help 
Jones and you help the whole circle. 
Now, when Jones comes to me, I ask 
myself two questions. First - is 
he honest? Yes. Second - is he as 
good a business man as he was 
before? And the answer is - he's 
better .

CLOSEUP - CLARK

Showing his reaction, as part of Dickson's speech comes 
over scene:

DICKSON'S VOICE
He is not only older and wiser, 
but his present trouble has taught 
him precaution. In my estimation, 
gentlemen, Jones is no risk. Neither 
are the thousands of other Joneses 
throughout the country . . .

CLOSEUP - SCHULTZ

To intercut with Dickson's speech.

CLOSEUP - AMES

To intercut with Dickson's speech.

CLOSEUP - IVES

To intercut with Dickson's speech.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

The group, as Dickson concludes his speech.

DICKSON
It's they who built this nation up 
to the richest in the world, and 
it's up to the banks to give them 
a break. Disraeli said security is 
the prosperity of the nation [4]

AMES
(cutting him off)
Why, Disraeli didn't say anything 
of the kind.

DICKSON
Well, he should have said it. It's 
as true now as it was then. And 
let us get the right kind of 
security. Not stocks and bonds 
that zig-zag up and down, not 
collateral on paper, but character!

CLARK
(indignantly)
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?

DICKSON
Not at all. That's Alexander 
Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest 
banking mind this country has ever 
known. Those are his exact words, 
gentlemen. Character!  It's the 
only thing you can bank on, and 
it's the only thing that will pull 
this country out of the doldrums.

CUT TO:

INT. CLUETT'S PRIVATE OFFICE - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Cluett sits at his desk, his face drawn, panic-stricken. 
He is like an animal at bay. The leader of the trio, Dude 
Finlay, sits in a chair directly in front of Cluett. The 
other two men stand on either side of the desk.

DUDE
(menacingly)
You know what we do to welchers, 
Cluett, don't you?

CLUETT
(trembling)
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must 
have been crazy! I lost my head 
completely!

DUDE
That's your funeral. We've got 
fifty thousand dollars comin' to 
us.

CLUETT
(helplessly)
I haven't got it.

CLOSE SHOT - DUDE

Shooting past Cluett.

DUDE
(barking)
Then what did you want to gamble 
for? If you'd have beat us out of 
fifty G's, you'd have been paid, 
wouldn't you? Well, we want our 
dough.

CLUETT
I'm sorry, Dude, but I 

DUDE
That don't do us any good.

CLUETT
But after all, you can't take blood 
from a stone.

DUDE
(threateningly - 
quietly)
We can take blood from anything  
(pauses)
If it's comin' to us.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

Shooting toward Cluett. Dude on opposite side of desk, the 
other two men still standing by the desk.

A look of alarm spreads over Cluett's face. There is nothing 
hidden in this threat.

CLUETT
(wants time to think)
Perhaps if you'll wait a little 
while, I might be able 

ONE OF THE MEN
(snappily)
We waited long enough!

DUDE
(shrewdly - to the 
men)
Nix. Lay off.
(to Cluett)
Now - what's the use of getting 
excited, Cluett?  It oughta be 
easy for you to lay your mitts on 
that kind of dough . . .

CLOSE SHOT - CLUETT

Shooting past Dude, as Dude continues, slowly, deliberately:

DUDE
There's plenty of it in this bank - 
laying around loose.

Cluett looks up - horror-stricken.

CLUETT
(pop-eyed, choked 
voice)
Good heavens, man! You're not 
suggesting that I 

DUDE
Why not?

CLUETT
(perspiring freely)
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !

DUDE
(flatly)
You don't have to do nothing.

Cluett looks up toward the men - then at Dude.

CLUETT
(slowly)
What do you mean?

DUDE
All you gotta do is fix a few things 
for us , and we'll do the rest, 
see?

There is a pause while Cluett stares at them, horrified, 
his confused mind trying to assimilate the ghastliness of 
their proposal. Suddenly he starts to rise.

79. MEDIUM SHOT

As Cluett gets to his feet and faces Dude across the desk.

CLUETT

NO, NO, I COULDN'T - I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT. I 

Smack! The rest of his speech dies in his throat. The man 
to his right has slapped him across the face with his open 
palm. Taken unaware, Cluett's hand goes to his cheek. He 
stares at them, bewildered and frightened.

Cluett, feeling himself trapped and helpless, slowly sinks 
into his chair.

CUT TO:

INT. ANTEROOM DICKSON'S OFFICE - MED. SHOT

Helen sits at her typewriter. A very dignified, beautiful 
woman of thirty approaches her. She is Phyllis Dickson, 
Dickson's wife. She radiates refinement and culture.

MRS. DICKSON
(pleasantly)
Good morning, Helen.

81. CLOSER SHOT
At Helen's desk, as Helen looks up 
at Mrs. Dickson.

HELEN
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.

MRS. DICKSON
Is that busy husband of mine busy?

HELEN
(indicating 
conference room)
He's at a board meeting.

MRS. DICKSON
(not unexpected)
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, 
I suppose.

HELEN
I'm afraid so.

MRS. DICKSON
Helen, did you ever try competing 
with a bank?

HELEN
No.

MRS. DICKSON
Well, take my word for it, and 
don't try it. It's useless!  If it 
were some other woman, I could 
handle her, but after all, you 
can't scratch a bank's eyes out 
now, can you?

HELEN
Hardly.

CLOSE SHOT - MRS. DICKSON

Shooting past Helen.

MRS. DICKSON
Oh, well. I guess the only other 
thing for me to do is to go out 
and buy myself a few sticks of 
dynamite. When he comes out, you 
tell him I'll be back. He hasn't 
gotten rid of me!

HELEN
All right.

83. MEDIUM SHOT

Helen laughs as Mrs. Dickson leaves in the direction of 
Cluett's office.

CUT TO:

INT. CYRIL CLUETT'S OFFICE - MED. CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR

The three racketeers are preparing to leave. Dude has his 
hand on the doorknob.

CLUETT
(nervously)
Dude - there's not any chance of 
my becoming involved in this, is 
there?

DUDE
You? No, you'll be all right, so 
long as you establish an alibi for 
tonight.

CLUETT
know, but 

DUDE
Be sure you're with somebody 
responsible in case any questions 
are asked. Understand?

CLUETT
But Dude, listen - couldn't we 
make this some other time?

DUDE
(positively)
Listen, buddy, you're getting by 
pretty easy. Quit squawking!

Cluett looks at Dude, then at the others, and realizes he 
is helpless.

He opens the door and the men file out, silently. Cluett 
shuts the door and CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he crosses back 
to his desk, shaking perceptibly. He reaches into a desk 
drawer and extracts a bottle of liquor.

As he takes a drink, Mrs. Dickson enters unannounced.

CUT TO:

MED. CLOSE SHOT

As Mrs. Dickson stands watching Cluett.

MRS. DICKSON
(playful reproach)
Oh, oh!

Cluett turns quickly. Upon seeing her, he makes an attempt 
to conceal the terror he feels.

CLUETT
(smiling feebly)
Oh, hello, Phyllis.

She advances toward him as he rises.

MRS. DICKSON
(shaking her head)
This won't do. Not during business 
hours . . .

CLUETT
Why, I needed a 

(OFFERING HER DRINK)
Want one?

MRS. DICKSON
(screwing up her 
face)
Heavens, no! Do you mind putting 
up with me until the financial 
genius gets thru genius-ing?

CLUETT
No, no, of course not. Not at all. 
Oh, here.

As she takes out a cigarette, he offers her a light. Mrs. 
Dickson notices that he is rather nervous.

MRS. DICKSON
What is the matter with you? You're 
trembling?

CLOSE SHOT - CLUETT

CLUETT
(trying to be light)
Am I? Why, I - I don't know any 
reason why I should be, unless of 
course it's you . . .

CLOSE TWO SHOT

MRS. DICKSON
Me?

CLUETT
Being alone with you has always 
done this to me. You know that.

MRS. DICKSON
For a celebrated bounder, that is 
an awful admission. Besides, I 
never knew that any female could 
do this to you .

CLUETT
Well, you can. You always could.

MRS. DICKSON
(smiling)
Liar! You're just suffering from 
lack of sleep.

He takes this as premature defeat, and heads back toward 
his desk.

MRS. DICKSON
(good-natured 
admonishment)
Here, here, here, now! Don't you 
go back to work on me, too. I'm 
getting tired of this. Besides, 
it's beginning to affect your looks 

CLUETT
(not understanding)
What is?

MRS. DICKSON
(finishing her little 
joke)
running around. Not your work.
(Cluett laughs in 
relief)
You'd better start reforming, Cyril!

CLUETT
If I thought you were the slightest 
bit interested, I would.

MRS. DICKSON
Not bad, not bad at all. Do you 
know something? I've always been 
curious about your line.

CLUETT
Line?

MRS. DICKSON
Whatever it is that makes you such 
a riot with women.

He shrugs off the compliment.

MRS. DICKSON
(continuing)
Come on Cyril, try a little bit of 
it out on me. I haven't had any 
first-class blarney thrown at me 
since the day I was married.

CLUETT
(trying hard)
But you see, it isn't blarney where 
you're concerned.

MRS. DICKSON
(laughs)
Now let me see, what comes next?
(a mocking tone)
Oh yes, I know - what are you doing 
tonight, Phyllis?

CLOSEUP - CLUETT

He is suddenly reminded of his pact with Dude Finlay. Terror 
returns to his face.

CLUETT
Tonight?

He suddenly gets an idea. He was told to be with someone 
around midnight. Someone who would be an alibi for him. He 
stares off at Phyllis Dickson. Why not?

MRS. DICKSON
(continuing)
Doesn't that come next?

MED. CLOSE SHOT

CLUETT
Yes, yes, it does. What are you 
doing tonight, Phyllis?

MRS. DICKSON
See, we're getting along famously!

CUT TO:

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MEDIUM SHOT

Clark is in a state of agitation. The other directors seem 
worn by the ordeal. Dickson remains adamant.

DICKSON
Most of the creditors I know 
personally. I've seen them grow up 
in the community. I knew their 
fathers and mothers before them.

CLARK
I know, Dickson. That's all very 
well. But you're taking too many 
chances. In these times a bank 
should keep liquid in case of 
trouble. In case of emergency!

CLOSER SHOT AT THE TABLE

All the men in the scene.

DICKSON
I know what you mean by that. You 
want me to hang on to our cash. 
Well, I don't believe in it. The 
law demands that I carry a certain 
legal reserve, and I'm doing it. 
The rest of our money is out working 
. . . working to help industry . . 
. to help build up business . . .

CLOSEUP - CLARK

As he almost shouts at Dickson.

CLARK
In the meantime, you're jeopardizing 
the safety of the bank. Well, we 
won't stand for it!

MED. CLOSE SHOT

Of the group, as Dickson turns to Clark.

DICKSON
You have to stand for it.

Meek little Ives once again tries to say something:

IVES
(exhausted)
But my dear friends . . .

SCHULTZ
(interrupting)
You're forcing us to take action 
against you, Dickson.

DICKSON LOOKS AT HIM:

DICKSON
Go ahead - take all the action you 
want!

He looks about at the others as he continues:

DICKSON
I'm running this bank my way. Get 
that clear!

CLARK
Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson 
refuses to consider our wishes. He 
refuses an offer to merge with the 
New York Trust - the only thing 
that will put this bank on safe 
ground. He insists upon running a 
bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . 
as faith!

DICKSON
Yes! You said it, Clark. That's 
the only thing that means anything 
to me.

CLOSEUP - CLARK

As Dickson's voice continues. Clark reacts appropriately.

DICKSON'S VOICE
Before I take a man into this bank, 
and before I extend credit to 
anyone, I satisfy myself on one 
thing - do I believe in him?

CLOSE PAN SHOT

On the other men - CAMERA PANNING from one to the other as 
Dickson's voice comes over the shot - finally CAMERA STOPS 
on Dickson.

DICKSON
So far, my judgement has been right 
one hundred per cent. One hundred 
per cent! When I start going wrong, 
you won't have to take any action. 
I'll turn the bank over to you. 
Then you can merge all you want 
to. I won't be the fellow to run 
it then. Good day, gentlemen!

He exits scene.

CAMERA TRUCKS AHEAD OF HIM as Dickson passes briskly through 
his outer office, stopping only to speak to Helen at her 
desk:

DICKSON
(cheerfully)
Helen, tell Matt I want to see 
him.

HELEN
Yes, sir.

CUT TO:

CLUETT
(mid-stream)
and after dinner, we could go 

MRS. DICKSON
(not at all angry)
Oh! Oh, no!  I think I've done 
enough experimenting for one day. 
Congratulations, Cyril. You've 
convinced me that you're a 
philanderer of the very first order. 
I shall recommend you highly.

CLUETT
(simply)
Please, please don't laugh at me, 
Phyllis. I must see you tonight!

CLOSER SHOT OF THE TWO

Favoring Mrs. Dickson.

MRS. DICKSON
Tonight, Oh, never! Tonight I have 
reserved for a very special 
occasion. Believe it or not, it's 
our wedding anniversary. Tom doesn't 
probably even remember it. But 
then, they never do, do they?

CLUETT'S VOICE

NO, THEY DON'T 

She shakes her head.

MRS. DICKSON
But I'm giving a party for him - a 
real, old-fashioned surprise party. 
Caps, bells, whistles, and 
everything. I'm really terribly 
excited about it. I've been planning 
it for months.

CLUETT
(after a pause)
Well 

MRS. DICKSON
(smiling)
Well, what?

CLUETT
(he won't give up)
Well, aren't you going to invite 
me?

MRS. DICKSON
(surprised)
You? No can do. It's all set. Just 
a few of Tom's closest friends.

CLUETT
Now Phyllis, if you don't invite 
me, I'm coming anyway.

MRS. DICKSON
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are 
respectable people. They'd probably 
bore you to death.

CLUETT
(desperate-sounding)
No, they won't. Not when you are 
there. Oh, please, be a sport. 
Please ask me.

MRS. DICKSON
(flattered, but a 
little suspicious)
Why are you so anxious?

CLUETT
(intense sincerity)
Don't you know?

MRS. DICKSON
No.

CLUETT
I want to be near you!

He steps closer to her.

MRS. DICKSON
What?

CLUETT
Don't you know I've been crazy 
about you for years?

MRS. DICKSON
(still flattered, 
lightly)
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...

CLUETT
I've loved you ever since I can 
remember, long before you married 
Tom Dickson.

MRS. DICKSON
(still only half-
believing)
Why, Cyril, you're insane 

CLUETT
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately 
avoided you. I was afraid of making 
a fool of myself. But I won't stand 
it any longer 

MRS. DICKSON
Cyril!

Before she realizes what has happened, he has swept her 
into his arms and crushes her to him. CAMERA PANS AWAY 
from them to the door to the outer office. The door opens 
and Matt steps in. He stops, suddenly, transfixed by what 
he sees off scene.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Phyllis Dickson in Cluett's arms (from Matt's angle). They 
suddenly become conscious of someone in the room and Phyllis 
struggles free, looking off scene toward Matt:

CUT TO:

CLOSE SHOT - MATT

From Cluett and Mrs. Dickson's angle.

He stares unbelievingly for a moment, and then collecting 
himself, turns and leaves the room, closing the door after 
him. CAMERA PANS BACK to Cluett and Mrs. Dickson. For a 
moment she is terribly upset.

CLUETT
Please forgive me, Phyllis. I lost 
my head for a minute. But I couldn't 
help it, Phyllis.

As she starts for the door, CAMERA PANS WITH HER. Cluett 
walks with her.

MRS. DICKSON
Please stop apologizing so much. 
You're making it far too important.

As they reach the door.

CUT TO:

INT. ANTE ROOM OF CLUETT'S OFFICE - MED. SHOT

Matt stands there, in a daze. Cluett's secretary is not 
there. He starts slowly forward, hardly knowing where he 
is going - CAMERA TRUCKING AHEAD OF HIM - there is a far-
away look in his eyes. His hand clutches the list of 
payrolls but as far as he is concerned, it is entirely 
forgotten. Several people talk to him, but Matt walks on 
heedlessly. He can't get over the shock of what he just 
saw. He always had been under the impression that Dickson's 
home life was a happy one. He never dreamed that Phyllis 
Dickson represented anything but the height of 
circumspection. And now - Cyril Cluett, of all people!

Helen comes running into scene, all excited.

HELEN
(happily)
Matt, where have you been? Mr. 
Dickson wants to see you right 
away. Hurry up!

He turns around mechanically and continues to walk in the 
direction of Dickson's office - CAMERA TRUCKING AFTER HIM. 
Helen falls into step with him.

HELEN
Say, I just heard the merger isn't 
going thru. Isn't that grand?

MATT
(tonelessly)
Yeah, swell.

They reach Dickson's outer office. Matt crosses it and 
exits into the private office. Helen looks after him - her 
face falls in disappointment. Matt is acting very strangely.  
She thought he'd be elated. She stares unhappily at his 
forlorn figure as it disappears thru the door.

CUT TO:

INT. DICKSON'S PRIVATE OFFICE - MED. SHOT

Dickson sits at his desk when Matt enters. When he sees 
Matt, his face breaks into a broad, pleasant smile.

DICKSON
(grandly)
Well, Matt, get ready for the big 
moment. Starting tomorrow you become 
assistant cashier. How's that?

Matt crosses to the desk as Dickson is speaking.

CLOSE SHOT AT DESK

As Matt stops in front of Dickson. Matt cannot share 
Dickson's enthusiasm. The scene he just witnessed has taken 
the joy out of everything.

MATT
It's all right. Thanks.

DICKSON
And what's more, keep up the good 
work and who knows - some day you'll 
be the fellow sitting behind that 
desk . . .
(the idea pleases 
him)
Not a bad thought, eh?

He suddenly notices Matt's lack of enthusiasm.

CLOSE SHOT OF THE TWO

Shooting toward Dickson.

He leans forward to look at Matt closely:

DICKSON
What's the matter? You don't seem 
very excited about it.

MATT
(feebly)
Sure, I think it's swell.

DICKSON
(scrutinizing him 
closely, very much 
hurt)
Say, come on. Show a little 
enthusiasm. What's the matter? Are 
you sick or something? Go on, fake 
it - even if it isn't real.

CLOSE SHOT - MATT

Shooting past Dickson.

Matt makes an attempt to snap out of it - and answers 
quickly.

MATT
Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's 
just kind of sudden, that's all.
(working up a little 
enthusiasm)
Sure, I'm excited. I think it's 
great. Only, well, you've done so 
much for me already . . . I'll 
never be able to thank you enough.

105. MEDIUM SHOT

DICKSON
Aw, go on, forget it. You came 
through, didn't you? That's all I 
wanted. A lot of them didn't think 
you would. You don't know how much 
satisfaction it's been to me. It's 
been swell. Well, when are you and 
Helen going to get married?

MATT
Well, I 

DICKSON
I suppose you want me to fix that 
up for you too, eh?

They are interrupted by the sudden appearance of Phyllis 
Dickson. Both men look up as she appears in the door.

CLOSE SHOT - MRS. DICKSON

As she stops in doorway. She glances fearfully, first at 
Matt and then at her husband, trying to sense whether Matt 
has said anything. She is quickly assured by Dickson's 
affable greeting.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

As Dickson comes toward her, arms extended:

DICKSON
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.

MRS. DICKSON
Hello, darling.

He kisses her. Then throws his arms around her for an 
exaggerated "teddybear" hug. Over Dickson's shoulder, 
Phyllis looks gratefully at Matt.

CLOSE SHOT - MATT

He returns her glance. His eyes are unable to disguise his 
contempt.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

Dickson and Phyllis. He releases her.

DICKSON
If this isn't a red-letter day for 
Tom Dickson! First I trample on 
the Board of Directors, then I 
promote Matt here to assistant 
cashier, and now to complete the 
day I have a visit from my sweet 
and lovely and gorgeous wife. What 
a man, what a man!

MRS. DICKSON
(with a half-smile)
It's amazing that your sweet, 
lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get 
to see you.

DICKSON
Oooh! That has the earmarks!

He notices Matt, still standing there, uncomfortably.

DICKSON
(good-naturedly)
Are you still here? Go on - go to 
work! What do you think I pay you 
for?

Matt exits.

CUT TO:

INT. ANTE ROOM OF DICKSON'S PRIVATE OFFICE - MEDIUM SHOT

As Matt comes out and moves quickly forward as if anxious 
to get away from the embarrassing situation he found himself 
in. Helen, upon seeing him, jumps up.

HELEN
(excitedly)
What happened? What did he say? 
Did you get the job?

MATT
(dolefully)
Yeah.

CLOSE TWO SHOT

She is perplexed by his unenthusiastic attitude.

HELEN
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I 
thought you'd be thrilled to death.

MATT
Come here.
(he takes her aside)
You know, a few minutes ago I was 
in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson 
was there.

HELEN
Well . . . ?

MATT
Well, he was making love to her.

Helen, although she had a vague suspicion, is shocked.

HELEN
(after a pause)
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.

MATT
I tell you, I saw them!

Helen stares at him, horrified.

HELEN
In Cluett's office?

MATT
Yes, right in his office, the rat. 
I'd like to take a crack at that 
guy.

A telephone rings.

HELEN
(as she goes to 
answer the phone)
Wait a minute. Now don't go away...

CUT TO:

INT. DICKSON'S PRIVATE OFFICE - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Dickson is seated with Mrs. Dickson on the arm of the chair.

DICKSON
(talking on the 
phone, as Mrs 
Dickson waits 
patiently)
Yes George . . . yes, sure . . . 
Oh, that's for tonight, eh? . . . 
Yes, certainly, I'll be there . . 
. Yes, we'll go down together and 
have dinner in Philadelphia . . . 
Mrs. Dickson gets so upset . . .  
That's right. . . . Yeah. . . . 
Just as soon as the bank closes. . 
. . Right. . . . Goodbye. . . .

He punches the intercom, speaks to Helen in the outer 
office.

HELEN'S VOICE
Yes?

DICKSON
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, 
just as soon as the bank closes. 
Make all the arrangements, will 
you?

HELEN'S VOICE
Yes, sir.

Mrs. Dickson looks visibly upset. Dickson can't help but 
notice.

DICKSON
What's the matter dear? What have 
I done now?

MRS. DICKSON
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were 
going out with me tonight.

DICKSON
Oh, I did have a date with you 
tonight, didn't I?

MRS. DICKSON
Yes.

DICKSON
I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten 
all about you. I'm so sorry, dear.

CLOSE SHOT OF THE TWO

Favoring Phyllis Dickson.

MRS. DICKSON
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to 
Philadelphia tonight. That's all 
there is to it.

DICKSON
But I have to go, dear. It's a 
very important banker's meeting.

MRS. DICKSON
(interrupting)
I don't care whether it's important 
or not. You said you were going 
out with me, and if you hadn't 
promised so faithfully, I wouldn't 
have gone and planned the whole 
thing.

DICKSON
Listen, it isn't so terribly 
important. We can go to the theatre 
any time.

MRS. DICKSON
The theatre?

MED. CLOSE SHOT

DICKSON
That's what it was you planned, 
wasn't it?

MRS. DICKSON
(after a slight 
hesitation)
Yes, of course.

DICKSON
You can take some of the girls. 
You can take Mildred - or Gwynn 

MRS. DICKSON
The girls!  I don't suppose it 
ever occurred to you that I might 
go out and find myself an attractive 
young man . . .

CLOSE SHOT OF THE TWO

Shooting toward Dickson, as he laughs boisterously.

DICKSON
Ho! Ho! Ho!

MRS. DICKSON
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't 
laugh if I were you. You may not 
suspect it, but I'm still attractive - 
to some.

DICKSON
Listen, don't go around being 
attractive to anyone but me . . .

MRS. DICKSON
Well . . .

DICKSON
Don't you forget that I'm still 
the head man around here too. Now 
we'll get the tickets changed for 
tomorrow night. You and I are going 
out together. How's that?

MRS. DICKSON
Tomorrow night?

A buzzer sounds, and a visitor is announced on the intercom.

DICKSON
Yes?

VOICE
Mr. Gardner's here.

DICKSON
(answering the 
intercom)
Oh, yes. That's that lawyer. All 
right, let him have nine thousand.
(returning attention 
to his wife)
Yes sir, I'll step you around this 
town like you've never stepped 
before. We will have dinner at the 
St. Regis - then we'll go to a 
nice, snappy show - then a nightclub - 
we'll listen to soft music, and 
who knows? Ha! - I might break 
down and dance with you!

MRS. DICKSON
(still skeptical)
All right. I'll postpone the whole 
thing until tomorrow night.

DICKSON
(assuringly)
Happy now?

MRS. DICKSON
(mock-pouting)
No.

116. MEDIUM SHOT
He takes her in his arms and kisses 
her.

DICKSON
(tenderly)
Poor kid, you know, I have been 
neglecting you.

MRS. DICKSON
Oh, I don't care, darling. I love 
you, anyway.

A buzzer sounds again, and Dickson answers the intercom.

DICKSON
Yes?

HELEN'S VOICE
Mr. Sampson . . .

DICKSON
All right. Send him in.

There is a knock on the door. Dickson moves away from his 
wife. He looks toward the door.

CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR

Sampson, an executive in the bank, enters. Sampson goes to 
Dickson with some papers in his hand. He lays the papers 
on the desk before Dickson.

DICKSON
Well, Sampson, what is it?

SAMPSON
Here's the data on the Clyde deal.

CLOSE SHOT AT DESK

Dickson is all absorbed.

DICKSON
Good. I'll take this along with 
me. Tell Clyde I'll see him 
tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of 
the delay.

SAMPSON
I'm afraid he's been stalling.

DICKSON
That's just exactly what he has 
been doing. This deal should have 
been closed weeks ago. Tell him to 
keep tomorrow open . . .

SAMPSON
He says he can't get away in the 
daytime.

DICKSON
How about his nights? He's too 
busy running around. Tell him to 
keep tomorrow night open, come in 
and sign this thing, or I'll call 
this whole deal off.

SAMPSON
Yes, sir.

CLOSEUP - PHYLLIS DICKSON

She stands by a window, listening. There is despair in her 
look as she hears him making arrangements for tomorrow 
night. Dickson's voice comes over this shot:

DICKSON'S VOICE
I'm sick and tired of these people 
dilly-dallying. People who can't 
make up their minds . . .

Mrs. Dickson's eyes close hopelessly, and she feels 
defeated. Again shut out from his scheme of things, she 
realizes he is incurable. On this picture of resignation:

FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

INSERT: CLOCK OVER THE VAULT, reading 5:07 CAMERA PANS 
DOWN to open vault.

INT. VAULT - MED. SHOT

Inside, several of the tellers are putting their cash away. 
One of them is just entering with his truck.

MATT
Everybody in?

TELLER
I guess so.

MATT
Where's Charlie?

TELLER
(amused)
Charlie's upstairs as sore as a 
pup. He's out fourteen cents, and 
he can't find it.

AD-LIB VOICES
Good night. Good night, Matt.

CUT TO:

122. OUTSIDE OF VAULT - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Cyril Cluett is standing at the bottom of a spiral staircase 
from which he has just descended. He stops a second and 
watches Matt, off scene. Cluett has gloves on, his hat in 
his hand, preparatory to going home. Matt does not see 
Charlie.

CUT TO:

123. OUTSIDE OF THE VAULT - CLOSE SHOT

Matt and Helen standing near the vault door.

HELEN
What's keeping you?

MATT
Oh, Charlie again.

HELEN
Say Matt, you haven't done anything 
about what you saw today, have 
you?

MATT
(still upset)
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd 
like to take a crack at that stiff-
necked, horse dollar.[6]

HELEN
Oh now, don't be silly.

MATT
(disgusted)
Can you imagine that guy? He was 
kissing her.

HELEN
Now you've got me worried, dear.
(she kisses him)
Promise me you won't butt in.

MATT
Okay, honey - but just the same 
I'd like to take a crack at that 

She puts her hand over her mouth:

HELEN
Shh . . . !
(whispering)
I'll wait for you upstairs.

MATT
All right, dear.

She leaves. Matt remains standing, a far-away look in his 
eyes. It is obvious he is thinking about the thing 
seriously.

124. MEDIUM SHOT

The boys who were inside the vault now file out, having 
properly locked away their cash. At the same time, Charlie 
wheels in his truck.

MATT
(kidding him)
Where you been?

CHARLIE
(annoyed)
Where do you think I've been?
(pointing to truck)
I took the baby for a stroll in 
the park.

The men hurry out of sight, laughing. Charlie disappears 
into the vault. Matt enters the vault, his mind still 
preoccupied.

INTERIOR VAULT MED. SHOT

As Matt goes directly to the burglar alarm.

INSERT: BURGLAR ALARM

As Matt's hand comes into scene and throws the switch down 
toward sign reading ON.

BACK TO SCENE:

MATT STARTS TO THE VAULT DOOR:

MATT
What's the matter, Charlie?

CHARLIE
I'm fourteen cents out, and it 
took me half an hour to find the 
mistake. And me with a date, too.

MATT
I remember once when your account 
checked.

CHARLIE
Yeah.

Matt goes to the time clock to check it up. He tinkers 
with it a moment.

CUT TO:

126. OUTSIDE OF VAULT - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Matt has just finished adjusting the time clock as Charlie 
comes out of the vault.

MATT
(pointing to time 
clock)
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting 
friend time clock for exactly nine 
o'clock, so no squawks out of you 
guys in the morning.

CHARLIE
(as he exits)
Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles 
of my own.

Matt smiles. He starts to shut the vault. He has it swinging 
half-way around when Cluett enters. When Matt sees Cluett, 
the smile dies on his lips.

CLUETT
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?

MATT
Yes, sir.

CLUETT
(peremptorily)
Let me see your cash book, will 
you?

MATT
Now?

CLUETT
Yes, now.

Matt looks at him a moment antagonistically. He has half a 
mind to talk to him right now, but he recalls Helen's 
admonitions and thinks better of it.

MATT
All right, sir.

He exits into vault. The moment he is gone, Cluett crosses 
quickly to the time clock.

INSERT: TIME CLOCK

As Cluett's gloved hand comes in and turns the indicator 
back to 12 o'clock.

127. INTERIOR VAULT - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Matt has opened a compartment and has brought out several 
sheets of paper. He goes thru them to find the one he wants.

INSERT: TIME CLOCK

Cluett's hand is seen throwing the switch up to indicator 
reading OFF.

BACK TO SCENE:

As Matt comes up to Cluett with a cash report. Cluett 
glances over it.

CLUETT
(returning sheet)
That's all right. But it seems to 
me you're carrying too much cash.

He exits. Matt glares belligerently at him.

CAMERA PANS with him as he returns the paper to compartment. 
He locks the compartment door, switches off the light in 
vault and CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he starts out of the

INT. TAXICAB - CLOSE SHOT - CLUETT AND MRS. DICKSON

They are in evening clothes, apparently they had some

CLUETT

Driver?

DRIVER'S VOICE
Yes.

CLUETT
Have you the correct time?

DRIVER'S VOICE
12:05.

CLUETT
12:05. Fine.

MRS. DICKSON
(looking out)
What's this?

CLUETT
My apartment.

MRS. DICKSON
(mock-melodramatic)
I knew I couldn't trust you. You 
told me you were taking me home.

CLUETT
Come on up for just a few minutes. 
We'll have just one drink, then 
we'll go.

MRS. DICKSON
(definitely)
No. I know the answer to that one.
(shaking her head)
I think you'd better take me home.

CLUETT
What's the matter? Afraid papa 
will spank?

CLOSER SHOT ON THE TWO

MRS. DICKSON
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that 
much interested. He's too busy 
rushing off to Philadelphia to 
make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, 
old bankers' meetings. Too busy 
closing big, important deals 
(on second thought)
I think I will have a drink.

CLUETT
Good for you. Come on.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE CLUETT'S APT. - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Cluett and Mrs. Dickson emerge from the elevator and cross 
to his apartment, CAMERA FOLLOWING THEM. Cluett fumbles in 
his pocket for the key.

MRS. DICKSON
You know, there ought to be a 
Congressional Medal for men like 
you. America's comfort to 
misunderstood wives. I never thought 
I would find myself in that class.

CLUETT
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's 
something much worse than being a 
misunderstood wife.

MRS. DICKSON
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]

CLUETT
A misunderstood bachelor.

Cluett smiles. He has the door open by now and stands aside 
to permit her to enter.

CUT TO:

INT. CLUETT'S APARTMENT - MED. CLOSE SHOT

At door. Phyllis Dickson has just stepped in, and Cluett 
follows. He closes the door and locks it.

CLUETT
(mock-melodramatic)
And now fair woman, I have you in 
my power.

MRS. DICKSON
(playing along)
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't 
got a moustache!

CLUETT
I'll grow a moustache by the time 
you get out of here.

CAMERA TRUCKS WITH THEM as he chases her into the next 
room. She alights on a piano bench, and runs her fingers 
up and down the scales. Suddenly Cluett stops. He stares 
off, a look of amazement in his face. Mrs. Dickson turns 
and follows his gaze and she, too, is startled.

CAMERA PANS QUICKLY over to the other side of the room. 
Matt sits on the edge of a chair waiting for them. He rises, 
looks off toward Cluett and Mrs. Dickson. As he starts 
forward, CAMERA PANS BACK to Cluett and Phyllis.

MRS. DICKSON
Why, Matt!

CLUETT
(when he recovers 
from his surprise)
What are you doing here?

Matt enters the scene.

MATT
The butler said I could stay. I 
told him it was important.

CLUETT
Oh, yeah?

Cluett steps over to a bell cord and pulls it.

MATT
He's not here. He left at nine 
o'clock. He said you gave him the 
night off.

Cluett wheels around, infuriated.

CLUETT
What do you want?

CLOSE SHOT OF THE TWO

Favoring Matt.

MATT
(uncomfortably)
Well, I thought I'd like to have a 
little talk with you.

CLUETT
(sharply)
I'm listening.

MATT
(hesitatingly)
It's funny - now that I'm here, I 
don't know just how to go about 
it.
(a glance toward 
Mrs. Dickson)
You see, I kind of expected to 
find you here alone.

AS CLUETT STARTS AWAY:

MATT
Do you mind stepping outside? We 
could talk 

134. MEDIUM SHOT

Cluett crosses to the door, where he stands, ready to open 
it. Mrs. Dickson stands by helplessly.

CLUETT
(a tone of dismissal)
Anything you have to say to me, 
you can say in the morning.

MATT
Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the 
same to you, I'd rather not wait. 
It's about you and Mrs. Dickson.

Cluett releases his hold on the doorknob. Mrs. Dickson 
looks at Matt uneasily - she is quickly sobering.

CLUETT
(aghast)
About me and . . .

He crosses slowly toward Matt.

PHYLLIS
Why Matt, what are you talking 
about?

CLOSER SHOT OF THE THREE

MATT
(quickly)
I know I've got a lot of nerve 
butting in like this, but I just 
couldn't help it. I thought I could 
stop two people from doing something 
they'd be sorry for.

CLUETT
(livid)
I'm not interested in what you 
think.

MATT
You've no right to do this to her, 
Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it 
over? It's only gonna get you into 
a lot of trouble.

CLUETT
I tell you, I'm not interested in 
your opinion.

MATT
(turns to Phyllis)
No?  Then maybe you'll understand, 
Mrs. Dickson. Oh, gee, he's crazy 
about you. Nobody knows it better 
than you. If he ever finds out, 
it'll kill him.

MRS. DICKSON
But Matt, you're mistaken about 
the whole thing. There isn't 
anything wrong. Mr. Cluett and I 
simply came here 

136. CLOSE SHOT - MATT & CLUETT

Shooting toward Matt.

CLUETT
(to Phyllis)
Phyllis, you don't have to explain 
anything.
(snappily, to Matt)
You'd do well to mind your own 
business.

MATT
(wheeling on him)
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's 
been like a father to me.
(his voice rising)
What has he ever done to you to 
deserve a deal like this?

CLUETT
(livid)
That will be just about enough! 
Now get out of here!

MATT
I guess I have said enough
(bitterly)
I'm just wasting my breath talking 
to you.

137. WIDER ANGLE
Taking in Mrs. Dickson, who stands 
slightly apart from the two men.

CLUETT
You're right for the first time. 
Now get out!

Matt ignores Cluett and looks toward phyllis Dickson.

MATT
I'm appealing to you, Mrs. Dickson. 
Think what you're doing to him. 
You're passing up the whitest man 
on earth 
(flaring up)
for a dirty, no-good.

Before he finishes the sentence, Cluett punches him. Matt, 
caught unawares, is thrown off balance and sent reeling. 
He drops between two chairs. Now, livid with rage, he pulls 
himself up, murder in his eyes. Cluett crosses quickly to 
a desk near the door, opens a drawer and extracts a 
revolver.

MRS. DICKSON
(frightened - cries 
out)
Cyril!

Matt, who was started toward Cluett, stops in his tracks 
upon seeing the gun.

138. CLOSE SHOT

Shooting toward Cluett.

CLUETT
(under his breath)
Now get out of here!

CAMERA PANS WITH MATT to the door.

MRS. DICKSON'S VOICE
Wait a minute, Matt!

Matt turns as she enters the scene.

MRS. DICKSON
I'll go with you.

CLUETT'S VOICE
But phyllis!

Mrs. Dickson steps closer to Matt's side. Cluett comes up 
to them.

CLUETT
You needn't go on account of this 
idiot.

Matt has opened the door.

MATT
(quietly)
You better carry that around with 
you all the time - you're going to 
need it.

Matt follows Mrs. Dickson out, leaving Cluett glaring after 
them.

INT. OF BANK - NIGHT

SERIES OF QUICK VIGNETTES:

Cluett's watch, showing 12:07.

A wall clock, showing 12:07.

A night watchman, alerted by suspicious noise, creeping up 
to the vault.

The night watchman, shot by figures in the shadows.

A small number of men rush out of the vault, clutching 
money bags and toting guns.

The night watchman, getting off a shot, before he crumples

INT. VAULT ROOM OF BANK - CLOSEUP ON DOOR

The vault door, partly opened. Over the shot we hear excited 
murmurs.

CAMERA STARTS TRUCKING BACK SLOWLY, until it takes in the 
full room. A fingerprint expert is working on the time 
clock for finger-print impressions. The medical examiner 
bends over the body of the watchman, whose face is covered 
with a cloth. A detective in charge of the proceedings 
stands around, looking very officious.

DETECTIVE
What do you say, Doc?

DOCTOR
Oh, I'd say about eight or nine 
hours.

DETECTIVE
Well, you'd better call the coroner.

CAMERA CONTINUES TRUCKING BACK, until it passes a group of 
tellers and clerks in a huddle. They listen breathlessly 
as Oscar, the youngest of the tellers, relates his story. 
For the moment he is the center of attraction, and he revels 
in it.

OSCAR
(breathlessly)
I was the first one to see it. I 
was coming down the stairs, and 
there was the dead watchman at my 
feet. You coulda knocked me over 
with a pin.

AD-LIB FROM LISTENERS
(murmuring)
Gee . . . Can you imagine . . .

OSCAR
Do you see that clock? Right there. 
That's where the bullet hit. When 
I saw that, you coulda knocked me 
over with a pin.

CLERK
Was there much blood?

OSCAR
Blood!
(gesturing toward 
body)
Come on over fellas. I'll show 
you.

The clerks head toward the dead body, but are intercepted 
by the officious detective.

DETECTIVE
(officiously)
Get back there . I don't want 
anything touched until the Inspector 
gets here.

The clerks, awe-stricken, retreat.

CHARLIE
(running up)
Oscar, what's the matter?

OSCAR
I was the first one to see it. I 
was coming down the stairs, and 
there was the watchman lying dead 
at my feet.

CHARLIE
No kidding?

OSCAR
No kidding. When I saw it, you 
could'a knocked me over with a 
pin.

CHARLIE
Where's Matt?

OSCAR
Matt?

CHARLIE
Yeah. He'll have a tough time 
thinking up a wise-crack for this 
one . . .

OSCAR
The detectives got Matt up there 
in Sampson's office.

CHARLIE
He has?

OSCAR
Yeah.

CLERK
Say, did Matt do it?

OSCAR
Don't look at me. I don't know.

TELLER
Say, he did look kind'a funny 
yesterday, didn't you notice it?

OTHERS
Yeah, he did. I noticed it too.

OSCAR
You could'a knocked me over with a 
pin!

CUT TO:

INT. SAMPSON'S OFFICE - CLOSEUP - MATT'S FRIGHTENED FACE

He sits in a chair. The side of his face is swollen from 
Cyril Cluett's punch of the night before.

INSPECTOR'S VOICE
(like a tri-hammer)
Come on, come on. You might as 
well tell me the truth. What did 
you do with the money?

MATT
I didn't do it. I told you all I 
know, Inspector.

CAMERA TRUCKS BACK revealing the other occupants of the 
room. The Inspector leans over Matt, firing questions at 
him. Two detectives are also there, one at the door, the 
other near Matt. Helen stands in a corner, pale and fearful, 
looking on.

INSPECTOR
You turned off the burglar alarm, 
you set the time clock, came back 
at twelve and emptied the boxes, 
didn't you?

MATT
(rises in indignation)
wasn't anywhere near this place 

INSPECTOR
(shoving him back 
down)
Sit down! When the watchman 
surprised you, you shot him - what'd 
you do with the gun?

MATT
(desperately)
I didn't do it! I haven't got a 
gun!

INSPECTOR
You used to carry a gun, didn't 
you?

142. MEDIUM SHOT
Sampson enters hesitantly.

SAMPSON
Pardon me, but I'd like to use my 
office for awhile!

INSPECTOR
(bellowing)
You use some other office!

Sampson exits scene hurriedly.

CUT TO:

INT. LOBBY OF BANK AT ENTRANCE - MED. CLOSE SHOT

The doorman, Gardiner, stands at the door, blocking a 
milling crowd, as Dickson, who apparently has already heard 
the news, enters.

PEOPLE
Come on, open up!

DICKSON
Good morning, everybody. What's 
the matter here? Open up the door. 
Come on, open this door.

GARDINER
Shall we let the people come in?

DICKSON
(snappily)
Of course, let them in! You're 
late now.

CAMERA TRUCKS WITH DICKSON as he proceeds toward interior 
of bank. Helen rushes into the scene and up to him. CAMERA 
STOPS.

HELEN
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to 
arrest Matt. They think he did it!

DICKSON
Where is he now?

HELEN
In Mr. Sampson's office.

DICKSON
Now don't you worry about it.

He crosses in that direction, followed by Helen.

CUT TO:

Cluett comes out of his office, looks around cautiously 
and satisfied he is unobserved, walks toward front door of

follows.

INT. SAMPSON'S OFFICE - MED. SHOT

Matt is still seated, with the detectives grilling him.

INSPECTOR
Then you did it and you did it 
alone 

Dickson enters.

DICKSON
(to Matt)
What's the matter? What's going on 
here?
(to the Inspector)
This is ridiculous! You can't hold 
this boy on a vague suspicion.

CLOSER SHOT OF THE GROUP

INSPECTOR
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.

DICKSON
Why pick on him ?

INSPECTOR
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. 
Whoever did it had a pretty good 
picture of the layout. Now Brown, 
here, is in charge of the vaults, 
isn't he?

DICKSON
Yes.

CLOSEUP - MATT

Over which comes Inspector's voice as he continues:

INSPECTOR'S VOICE
The burglar alarm was turned off. 
The time clock was set for 12 
o'clock. What more do you want?

DICKSON'S VOICE
Somebody else could have done it, 
couldn't they?

INSPECTOR'S VOICE
He admits that he set the clock 
himself.

Matt looks up toward inspector.

MATT
I did. I set it for nine o'clock 
this morning.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - GROUP

As the Inspector turns to Matt:

INSPECTOR
Then who changed it?

MATT
(helplessly)
I don't know.

DICKSON
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

The Inspector turns back to Dickson.

DICKSON
What time did this thing happen?

INSPECTOR
The clock opposite the vault was 
stopped by a bullet at 12:09.

DICKSON
All right. If the boy proves an 
alibi, he's all right, isn't he?

INSPECTOR
If he can do it, yes.

DICKSON
Why, certainly he can.
(to Matt)
Matt, now all you've got to do is 
tell them where you were last night, 
between twelve and twelve-thirty, 
and everything will be all right.

MATT
(averting Dickson's 
gaze)
I already told him I was home.

DICKSON
(to Inspector)
There you are.

INSPECTOR
That's what he says. I got a man 
from headquarters checking up on 
it now.

DICKSON
(confidently)
Good.
(to Matt, smiling)
You've got nothing to worry about. 
Soon as the report comes in, you'll 
be released.
(to Inspector)
And listen, don't talk so loud. 
Take it easy. Coast a little.

He exits scene.

operator at the switchboard. Oscar, the young teller, is 
relating his story for the hundredth time.

OSCAR
Gee, what do you think?  There was 
that watchman, that poor watchman, 
lying on the floor right in front 
of me. Oh, you could'a knocked me 
over with a pin!

OPERATOR
(wide-eyed)
You don't say! Dead?

OSCAR
Dead? He was lifeless! You know, I 
was the first one to see him. I 
was coming down the stairs, and 
there was the watchman lying on 
the floor, right in front of me. 
Dead! I tell you, you could'a 
knocked 

OPERATOR
(interrupting)
Yeah, I could'a knocked you over 
with a pin.

OSCAR
Yeah, you could'a 
(realizes he is 
getting the brush-
off)
Oh - almonds to you! Almonds!

Oscar exits scene. The operator turns her attention to the 
switch-board, apparently Oscar has interrupted a 
conversation she has been having.

OPERATOR
Hello, Mame. This is Gert, again 

(PAUSE)
Say, listen - I just heard something 
that'll make your head swim . . . 
Listen to this . . . Yeah, the 
bank was robbed last night. Yeah,

Who did it?

I don't know who did it, but the 
chief teller's in an awful jam.

MAME
Call me up later. I'm going to 
call up Lou now.

She pulls the plug, plugs in another wire.

MAME
Hello, Lou. Did you hear what 
happened over at the Union National 
Bank?
(a light flashes)
Wait a minute, Lou.

Hello?  Yes, sir. I'm trying to 
get them.

pretty solid.

At the mention of the Union National, the old lady looks 
up, startled.

4TH MAN
I did too.

3RD MAN
Half a million is a lot of money. 
I wouldn't be surprised if they 
had to close their doors.

The first man drops a coin in the old lady's palm and they 
leave. The beggar woman, oblivious of the coin in her hand, 
stares unbelieving, at the departing men. Suddenly her

you can just kiss it goodbye.

3RD MAN

Naw, you're kidding 

MAN
No, I'm not.

3RD MAN
Holy smoke!

He rushes out of the scene. The other two stare after him.

2ND MAN
(over-his-shoulder, 
to third man)
If you've got any friends, you'd 
better call them up too.

MAN
That's a good idea. I have friends 
of my own.

He dashes out of scene.

2ND MAN
(turning to 
bartender, who has

Will you loan me that pen of yours? 
I'm in an awful hurry.

CAMERA MOVES ON to a CLOSE SHOT of a teller frantically

Inspector is still holding his ground. Matt sits dejectedly 
in the same place as before.

INSPECTOR
(to Dickson)
All I know is the bank's been robbed 
and a murder's been committed. The 
way I see it, Brown here looks 
guilty.

CLOSER SHOT ON GROUP

DICKSON
What are you talking about? He had 
no more to do with it than you 
did.

INSPECTOR
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.
(emphatically)
Why, this kid's got a record.

DICKSON
So have you. So have I. So's 
everybody got a record. What 
difference does that make? You 
can't go around pinning crimes on 
people just because they 

He is interrupted by the sound of the door opening. He

SAMPSON
Mr. Dickson! Can I see you for a 
minute?

No, I'm busy. See me later.

SAMPSON
But this is important, Mr. Dickson. 
Looks like there's a run on the 
bank.

unbelievingly:

DICKSON
What? A run on the bank!

CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he rushes over to the door to

164. OUTER OFFICES OF BANK - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Sampson and Dickson. Dickson's face clouds.

SAMPSON
They've been coming in steady all 
morning. I have called for some 
extra police.

DICKSON
(his eyes glued on 
the crowd)
All right. Send down to the vaults 
and have our reserve cash sent up 
here right away.

SAMPSON
We haven't much on hand, you know. 
If it gets any worse, I hope we 
don't have to close the doors.

165. CLOSE SHOT

Favoring Dickson.

He turns to Sampson.

DICKSON
(flaring up)
The bank's reputation wouldn't be 
worth a nickel after that. This is 
just a flurry, that's all. They've 
heard about the robbery and got 
panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold 
of our available securities and 
have them turned into cash. Wait a 
minute. Get my personal stuff and 
have that turned into cash too. 
Tell the boys anyone caught arguing 
with a depositor will be fired on 
the spot.

SAMPSON
Yes, sir.

166. MEDIUM SHOT

As Sampson leaves. Dickson starts out in the direction of

Dickson turns. Clark and several directors appear.

CLARK
(grimly)
We want to talk to you.

DICKSON
What about?

CLARK
We'll discuss that in the board 
room.

He turns to follow, then is stopped by another voice.

DETECTIVE
Oh, Mr. Dickson! We got a check on 
Brown's alibi. Do you want to hear 
it?

DICKSON
(only a slight 
hesitation)
All right.
(to Clark)
I'll be with you in a minute, Clark.

ask you, that's all.

CAMERA PANS TO THE DOOR as it opens and a detective enters, 
beckons to the Inspector off scene.

168. MEDIUM SHOT

MED. CLOSE SHOT

As the Inspector comes up to the group around Matt.

INSPECTOR
(carelessly)
So you were home last night?

MATT
(averting his gaze)
Yes.

INSPECTOR
What time did you get in?

MATT
(haltingly)
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.

INSPECTOR
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure 
it was that?

MATT
Yes.

The Inspector turns away and CAMERA PANS WITH the Inspector 
as he crosses quickly to the door and beckons to the 
detective outside.

INSPECTOR
All right, Kelley.

Kelley returns to the room accompanied by a little old 
Irish woman. She looks around the room nervously. Inspector 
leads her toward Matt.

MED. SHOT OF GROUP

As everyone stares at her curiously.

INSPECTOR
(indicating Matt)
Do you know this young man, Mrs. 
Halligan?

MRS. HALLIGAN
Sure I do. He has the best room in 
me house. The one with the fancy 
wallpaper.

CLOSEUP - MATT

He feels himself cornered. The Inspector's voice comes 
over the shot.

INSPECTOR'S VOICE
Did you happen to be awake when he 
came in last night?

MRS. HALLIGAN
Yes, sir. I was having me hot 
mustard bath.

INSPECTOR
What time was it?

MED. CLOSEUP - GROUP

As Mrs. Halligan continues.

MRS. HALLIGAN
for the rheumatism, you know.

INSPECTOR
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?

MRS. HALLIGAN
It was late, I know. The Dooley 
sisters was already in. They work 
at a show, you know.

The Inspector is getting impatient.

INSPECTOR
What time was it?

MRS. HALLIGAN
Huh?

INSPECTOR
What time did Matt Brown get in?

MRS. HALLIGAN
Now, let me see - a half hour after 
the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley 
sisters never get home until after 

INSPECTOR
(snappily)
I don't care about the Dooley 
sisters - what time did he get in?

MRS. HALLIGAN
That's just what I'm trying to 
tell you, sir. It was a half hour 
after the Dooley sisters . . .

INSPECTOR
Was it twelve o'clock?

MED. CLOSE SHOT

Dickson, Matt, and the rest of the group. Some show their 
amusement. Dickson and Matt, however, are serious. Mrs. 
Halligan's voice comes into scene.

MRS. HALLIGAN
No, it wasn't twelve - 'cause the 
Dooley sisters . . .

INSPECTOR'S VOICE
(interrupting her 
quickly)
Was it one o'clock?

174. CLOSE SHOT

Inspector and Mrs. Halligan.

MRS. HALLIGAN
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...

INSPECTOR
(jumping her)
It couldn't have been earlier?

MRS. HALLIGAN
No. It wasn't earlier because...

INSPECTOR
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley 
sisters weren't in yet.

MRS. HALLIGAN
(firmly)
No - because me clock struck four, 
and when it strikes four, it's 
one.

INSPECTOR
(exasperated)
There you are!

175. MEDIUM SHOT

Matt speaks:

MATT
Aw, she doesn't know what she's 
talking about.

Mrs. Halligan looks at him, offended.

MRS. HALLIGAN
Who don't know?

She comes toward him threateningly.

MRS. HALLIGAN
Listen here, young man - nobody 
ever called me a liar yet and got 
away with it 

INSPECTOR
(coming after her, 
takes her arm)
That's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks.

Inspector leads her to the door. On the way Mrs. Halligan 
continues to mumble her protest against Matt's insult.

MRS. HALLIGAN
For two nickels I'd knock his block 
off. I never told a lie in me life.

She exits out of room.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

As Dickson steps closer to Matt.

DICKSON
(heartsick)
Is that true, Matt?

Inspector comes up to them now.

INSPECTOR
Of course it's true - and he knows 
it.

DICKSON
(tenderly)
Listen, Matt. If you don't tell 
the truth, I can't help you. Where 
were you last night?

MATT
(after a pause)
Aw, she was right. I didn't get in 
till after one o'clock.

Dickson is deeply disappointed.

MATT
(quickly - 
appealingly)
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. 
Honest I wasn't . . .

THE INSPECTOR BARKS AT MATT:

INSPECTOR
Then where were you?

177. CLOSE SHOT

Favoring Dickson as he leans closer to Matt.

Matt, do you realize you're up 
against something? You're being 
charged with murder. It's serious, 
son. Now come on, I know you didn't 
do it.
(gestures toward 
Inspector)
But we've got to make them believe 
it. Come on, tell the truth, where 
were you last night?

MATT
(doggedly)
I can't tell you.

Matt maintains a determined silence.

DICKSON
(getting an idea)
Listen, if I get them out of the 
room, will you tell me ?

Matt looks at him. Dickson is the only person he cannot 
tell his secret to.

MATT
No. I won't.

DICKSON
You're protecting somebody.

MATT
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!

DICKSON
Yes, you are. You're protecting 
somebody. Now listen, it doesn't 
make any difference who it is. It 
can't be as important as this. Now 
come on, tell me. Where were you 
last night?
(a note of 
desperation)
Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, 
you trust me, don't you?

No reply from Matt. Dickson is heartsick. He turns, 
helplessly, away from Matt and walks out of Sampson's 
office.

CUT TO:

INT. THE LOBBY OF THE BANK - CLOSE SHOT

Of Gert, the telephone operator.

GERT
(all excited - into 
phone)
What a day, Mame! Everybody's coming 
in and drawing their money out.
(innocently)
Gee, Mame - I wonder what started 
it.

179. THE LOBBY OF THE BANK - LONG SHOT

Shouting from the offices. The lobby is now packed to the 
doors with frantic depositors. The low grumbling of before 
is now replaced by vociferous condemnation of the bank and 
Dickson. Individual protestations are heard above the din 
of the crowd.

Dickson enters scene, and CAMERA TRUCKS AHEAD OF HIM as he 
quickly passes several tellers, giving them instructions 
to pay the depositors without delay. Sampson catches up 
with him.

SAMPSON
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're 
going crazy.

DICKSON
Did you get the case for the 
securities?

SAMPSON
Yes, sir.

DICKSON
Mine too?

SAMPSON
Yes, sir. But soon as our money 
runs out, they'll mob the place.

Dickson looks off toward the crowd.

DICKSON
The fools! If they only knew it, 
they're making things worse for 
themselves. Somebody starts a silly 
rumor, and they lose their heads.

SAMPSON
What'll we do?

DICKSON
I'll talk to them. Listen, go back 
and tell the boys to stall as much 
as possible. Tell 'em not to pay 
any attention to what I said. Tell 
'em to verify every signature.

HE LEAVES THE SCENE AS WE

CUT TO:

180. LOBBY OF THE BANK - LONG SHOT

Taking in a greater portion of the lobby. Dickson comes 
into the scene in the b.g. and stands on the stairs, looking 
down at the crowd. He suddenly holds up his hand and shouts:

DICKSON
Take your time, folks. Don't get 
excited. Everybody stay in line. 
You'll all be taken care of. Don't 
worry about anything. Plenty of 
time for everything.

He has to raise his voice even louder.

DICKSON
Now listen, everybody! Listen to 
me!

Gradually their attention is attracted to him. All eyes 
are turned in his direction.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

Shooting toward Dickson, past the crowd.

Dickson standing on the stairs. The people looking up at 
him.

DICKSON
I want you to know that your money 
is safe. This bank is in excellent 
condition. If you've heard any 
reports to the contrary, it's based 
on malicious rumors.

AD-LIB FROM CROWD
Yeah? Maybe . . .

MAN
It's a lotta hooey! We want our 
money!

DICKSON
All right. You'll get your money - 
every penny!

AD-LIB FROM CROWD
We want it now! We don't want no 
speeches!

CLOSE SHOT - DICKSON

AS HE ADDRESSES THE CROWD:

DICKSON
Listen to me now. It takes time. 
I've got seven paying tellers 
working just as fast as they can. 
If you'll all calm down, I'm making 
arrangements to keep the doors 
open until four o'clock this 
afternoon and you can be paid today.

MEDIUM SHOT OF THE CROWD

As they cheer their approval and return to their buddies.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

As Dickson starts back toward the offices, Sampson comes 
to meet him.

SAMPSON
We can't keep open till four 
o'clock. We haven't cash enough to 
last an hour.

DICKSON
Don't you think I know it?

They both start walking toward Dickson's office - CAMERA 
TRUCKING WITH THEM. As they pass the conference room, 
Schultz comes out and stops Dickson.

SCHULTZ
We're still waiting for you, 
Dickson.

Dickson looks up, studies Schultz a moment, as if trying 
to make up his mind whether to consult the Board of 
Directors or not.

CUT TO:

INT. DIRECTORS' ROOM - MED. SHOT

The door opens and Dickson enters, followed by Schultz. 
They all look up. Dickson goes up to them.

DICKSON
Well, gentlemen, we've got about 
one more hour to go. You know what 
that means?

MED. CLOSE SHOT

Dickson and the Directors.

DICKSON
(continuing)
We'll be forced to shut the doors. 
I've worked twenty-five years night 
and day to keep this bank alive. 
You've all made money out of it. 
Are you willing to help?

CLARK
(defiantly)
What do you mean, help?

DICKSON
I know that among you, you have at 
least a million dollars in various 
banks throughout the city. Get 
that money over here and I'll stop 
this run within five minutes.

CLARK
That sounds very simple, Dickson, 
but why should we jeopardize our 
personal fortunes?

DICKSON
I have everything I own in it. 
It's your bank as well as mine, 
isn't it?

187. CLOSE SHOT

Clark and Schultz.

CLARK
(this is just what 
he's been waiting 
for)
Oh, is it? Since when? Judging 
from the way you've ignored us, 
you wouldn't think so.

SCHULTZ
We tried to reason with you, but 
you wouldn't listen to us.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

Shooting toward Dickson.

CLARK
The depositors you were protecting 
were the first ones to pounce on 
you. You thought they were your 
friends. Why don't you go out there 
now and try and get some help from 
them?

DICKSON
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't 
reason with a mob.

CLOSEUP - CLARK

CLARK
No. You can't reason with anyone 
else when you're in a jam. We 
pleaded with you to keep liquid, 
but you wouldn't listen to us. You 
preached to us about faith and a 
lot of other rubbish. Now you want 
our help. You want us to throw a 
lot of cash into a bank that you've 
wrecked. All right. There's one 
way you can get it. Give us an 
option on your stock and resign as 
president.

CLOSEUP - DICKSON

DICKSON
(quietly - tense)
So, that's it, eh? You've waited a 
long time for this chance, haven't 
you?
(his voice rising)
Well, I'm not going to resign now - 
or ever.

191. WIDER ANGLE

Taking in the others at the table.

SCHULTZ
You have no choice.

DICKSON
I haven't? I'll shut the bank first.

CLARK
(terrified)
Say, you can't do that 

DICKSON
I can't? You just wait and see. If 
that run doesn't stop within the 
next hour, I'll shut the doors. 
You know what that means? The bank 
examiner will step in tomorrow. 
You'll be forced to liquidate. 
I'll insist upon it. The depositors 
will be paid one hundred cents on 
the dollar. What's left you 
gentlemen can have. But I'll 
guarantee there won't be enough to 
pay your next month's garage bill.

With which ultimatum, he crosses to the door and exits, 
CAMERA PANNING WITH HIM.

CUT TO:

INT. OUTSIDE CONFERENCE ROOM - MED. CLOSE SHOT

As Dickson barges out. He stops in front of the door, and 
looks off toward lobby.

INT. LOBBY OF BANK - FULL SHOT

Pandemonium has broken loose. Men and women are hysterical. 
The police battle with recalcitrant depositors in a 
desperate effort to maintain order. Strong men push weak 
ones out of the lines. Wild-eyed women jostle and scramble 
to get near the paying tellers. Sex and priority rights 
are totally disregarded. Above it all the din is deafening.  
Men and women are clamoring for their life's savings, ready 
to commit murder to retrieve their little stakes.

CUT TO:

194. OUTSIDE CONFERENCE ROOM - CLOSEUP - DICKSON

His face clouds. As he stands there watching the chaos, 
slowly the deep concern vanishes from his face and his jaw 
sets in grim determination. He starts toward the stairs.

CUT TO:

195. ENTRANCE OF BANK - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Cyril Cluett enters from outside, looking guiltily around. 
Then he starts forward and exits from scene. The moment he 
is gone, Detective #3, who followed him out, appears in 
the doorway and crosses in the direction taken by Cluett.

CUT TO:

196. OUTSIDE CONFERENCE ROOM - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Dickson and Sampson.

SAMPSON
Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!

DICKSON
Get all the big bills in the place. 
Take them out and get them changed. 
Get nothing but ones and fives. 
Distribute them among the tellers.  
Tell them to take their time. Stall 
as much as possible. Count and 
recount the money.

SAMPSON
Yes, sir.

DICKSON
I hate to do this, but I've got to 
have time to dig up some help. I 
think I know where I can get some 
real cash. Snap into it, Sampson. 
We will lick this thing yet.

He starts out of scene towards his office. CAMERA TRUCKS 
AFTER HIM, as he crosses past Helen, talking without 
breaking stride.

DICKSON
Come on in here, Helen. Bring your 
book. I want some numbers to try 
to get some action. Get Parker at 
the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . 
. Winslow and old man Harris at 
the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, 
Helen. Just as quick as you can.

HELEN
Yes, sir.

Look at that mob. They're going

AMES
You know, this run isn't doing the 
reputation of this bank any good.

IVES
My dear friends 

SCHULTZ
(interrupting)
How much longer is Dickson going 
to hold out?

O'BRIEN
You know Dickson as well as we do. 
He'll shut the doors before he 
gives up control.

CLARK
All right, let him! I'm sick and 
tired of hearing about him. If he 
wants to run the bank, let him do 
it. I don't want any part of it.

IVES
My dear friends 

CLARK
Oh, shut up!

SAMPSON
Stall! Stall!

One teller faces an angry depositor.

TELLER
Er, is this your signature?

Certainly it's my signature. You've 
seen it often enough.

I'm sorry, but I'll have to verify 
it.

Hello, Parker. Listen. Listen, 
I've got to have a million dollars 
in cash, and I've got to have it 
quick.
(pause)
What?
(pause)
No, no, no. Tomorrow is no good. I

Of course it's safe. Why, the bank's

that.

DETECTIVE
(to 2nd Detective)
Is the chief's car outside?

2ND DETECTIVE
Yes, sir.

INSPECTOR
Okay. Come on son. Let's go.

Oh, Matt . . .

Sorry, sister.

MED. CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR

As Detective #3 enters the room. CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as 
he crosses to the Inspector.

INSPECTOR
What did you find out, Mike?

MIKE
I've been trailing the cashier 
like you told me. You're right 
about that guy, chief. There's 
something screwy somewhere.

INSPECTOR
Never mind all that. What did you 
find out?

MIKE
He left here about an hour ago and 
went down to Dude Finlay's joint.

INSPECTOR
Dude Finlay?

MIKE
Yes, sir.

CLOSE SHOT - MATT & HELEN

Helen slowly lifts her head from Matt's shoulder. Her eyes 
widen as she hears the name of Dude Finlay. Mike's voice 
comes over this shot.

MIKE'S VOICE
He stayed about half an hour, and 
then he came right back here. He's 
in his office now.

INSPECTOR
(slowly dawning 
realization)
That's where I must have seen that 
guy 

Helen starts out of scene.

Who was with him?

Now we're beginning to get 
somewhere.

INSPECTOR
Oh, Kelly - call me up in Cluett's 
office in about five minutes.

Good heavens, man, you're taking 
no chances. No, I'm perfectly 
willing to sign everything over to 
you. What more do you want? I need 
action. I've got to have it within 
the next half hour.
(pause)
Yeah, sure - the board of directors 
turned me down, but you know why.
(pause)
Listen. Listen, read it. It wouldn't 
be a drop in the bucket to you.
(pause)
I see. Uh-huh. All right - ask me

He slams the phone down angrily.

him.

INSPECTOR
(very suave)
I hope you don't mind me asking 
you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.

CLUETT
Of course, yes. Just what would 
you like to know, Inspector?

INSPECTOR
Where were you at twelve o'clock 
last night?

CLUETT
(much relieved)
That's very simple. I was home.

213. CLOSE SHOT - INSPECTOR AND CLUETT

Shooting toward Cluett.

INSPECTOR
That is simple, isn't it? I assume 
you can prove that if necessary.

CLUETT
(feeling very sure 
of himself)
Oh yes, of course. There was someone 
with me. A lady.

INSPECTOR
(smiling - affably)
Looks like you're going to have no 
trouble at all. What was the lady's 
name, Mr. Cluett?

CLUETT
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd 
rather not say - that is, unless 
it becomes absolutely essential. 
You see, she's married.

INSPECTOR
(a big understanding 
grimace)
Oh!

CLUETT
(smiling)
You understand?

INSPECTOR
(assuringly)
Why, of course.

The telephone rings at this point. Cluett turns to answer

It's for you, Inspector.

Cluett gets up out of his chair to permit Inspector to get 
to the phone.

INSPECTOR
Thanks.

CLUETT
(trying to be light)
Somebody must be in good humor. He 
was humming "Mother Machree."

INSPECTOR
(laughing)
It's one of the boys from 
headquarters. He always sings 
"Mother Machree" whenever he's got 
good news. Looks like this case'll 
be settled in no time.

CLOSEUP - CLUETT

His face clouds at this. He listens while Inspector's voice

Yeah. What? . . . You don't mean

He feels himself trapped. He glances around the room quickly 
to determine his chances to escape. He keeps edging closer

grabs hold of the doorknob.

Suddenly, Cluett snaps open the door and like a flash is 
out of the room.

CUT TO:

INT. MEN'S LOCKER ROOM - FULL SHOT

Metal lockers line the entire room. Cluett comes to door 
on other side of the room. Just as he gets there, he hears 
the detectives entering off scene. Quickly he changes his 
mind and springs into a space between a row of lockers and 
the wall, at the same time drawing his gun.

Inspector and detectives enter. The Inspector and one of 
the detectives advance into the room cautiously, holding 
their guns in front of them. Kelley, the other detective, 
shrewdly separates from them.

DETECTIVE
He must be here. There's only one 
door.

INSPECTOR
All right. Find him.

Cluett slips into a locker and closes the door behind him. 
They hear the noise off scene.

INSPECTOR
What was that noise?

DETECTIVE
Sounded like a locker.

INSPECTOR
A locker, eh?  Well, search every 
one of them. He must be in one of 
'em.

They search the lockers one by one, until the Inspector 
happens upon the one with Cluett inside. He leaps out, gun 
drawn.

CLOSE SHOT - CLUETT

From Inspector's angle.

CLUETT
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. 
Drop that gun.

INSPECTOR

All right, Jack, all right.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

The detective and Inspector. The detective drops his gun, 
but the Inspector keeps his levelled, toward Cluett, off

INSPECTOR
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is 
only going to make it worse for 
you.

CLUETT
Stand back, Inspector. Let me out 
of here, or I'll shoot you!

He starts slowly forward.

The Inspector ignores the warning. He takes a few more 
steps forward.

CLOSEUP - CLUETT

From Inspector's angle.

CLUETT
I warn you, Inspector - I'll shoot!

He levels his gun.

A shot is heard. The gun drops out of Cluett's hand. His 
arm goes limp. His face screws up in pain.

INSPECTOR
(rushing forward to 
grab him - to the 
detectives)
Let me see it! Let me see it! It's 
only his finger. Get me a towel.

you.

INT. DICKSON'S PRIVATE OFFICE - CLOSE SHOT - DICKSON

Still at phone. His coat is now off and flung across the

His appearance indicates he has been on the phone a long 
time.

DICKSON
(into phone - 
defeated)
You can't do a thing. You're up to 
your neck. All right.

He listens. He is being turned down. He hangs up receiver. 
Over his face slowly comes a look of deep perturbation. He 
refers to a small notebook open on his desk. His finger 
runs down the list of names as he searches for another 
prospect.

CAMERA PANS ACROSS as Inspector and other detectives, with 
Cluett in custody, enter Dickson's office, all excited.

INSPECTOR
You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown 
didn't have anything to do with 
it. Here's your man.

DICKSON
Why, you must be crazy. I've known 
this man for years.

INSPECTOR
He's just confessed. He's been 
mixed up with the toughest gangsters 
in town.

CAMERA PANS BACK to Dickson, as he stares, unbelievingly, 
at the shrunken figure of Cluett, who is trembling with 
fear.

234. CLOSER SHOT

Favoring Cluett and Dickson.

DICKSON
Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's 
name, what got into you?

CLUETT
(his voice shaking)
I don't know. It's all been like a 
crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.

DICKSON
What happened?  You're not a thief. 
How'd you get mixed up with these 
kind of people?

CLUETT
Gambling - I owed them a lot of 
money. Last week I lost over fifty 
thousand dollars!

DICKSON
(shocked)
Fifty thousand dollars!

CLUETT
(hysterically)
But I didn't kill that man last 
night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!

CLOSEUP - CLUETT

AS HE CONTINUES:

CLUETT
(dully)
Yesterday they came to collect it. 
I begged them to wait. I wanted 
time to think, but they wouldn't 
listen to me.
(his voice rises)
They threatened to kill me if I 
didn't pay it! I was desperate! I 
didn't know what to do!

CLOSEUP - DICKSON

As he reacts to Cluett's confession. Cluett's voice 
continues over this shot.

CLUETT'S VOICE
(hoarsely - quickly)
Then they suggested that I help 
them rob the bank. All I had to do 
was turn off the alarm and ? 185 ?

fix the time clock. It all sounded so easy. It seemed like 
a way out.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - GROUP

AS CLUETT CONTINUES:

CLUETT
(wildly)
I didn't know anybody was going to 
be killed!

The Inspector addresses Cluett:

INSPECTOR
What were you doing at Finlay's 
this morning?

CLUETT
They took my keys yesterday. I 
went there to get them back.

DICKSON
(desperately)
If you were in a jam, why didn't 
you come to me? I would have helped 
you out. You know that.

238. CLOSE SHOT

Favoring Cluett.

CLUETT
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. 
Dickson. I didn't know what I was 
doing. I wandered around in a daze. 
All I could think of was that they 
were going to kill me . . .
(pleading desperately)
You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. 
Dickson? You won't go back on me 
now, will you? I'll die if they 
send me to prison!

INSPECTOR
(practical)
Don't forget there's a dead watchman 
downstairs.

CLUETT
(wild-eyed)
I didn't kill him! I had nothing 
to do with that, I tell you! I was 
home in my apartment last night - 
I can prove it!

MED. CLOSE SHOT OF GROUP

INSPECTOR
(skeptically)
Claims he was there with a married 
woman. Doesn't want to mention her 
name.

CLUETT
(desperately - to 
Dickson)
He won't believe it, Mr. Dickson. 
But it's the truth - honest it is. 
I was in my apartment last night - 
ask your wife - she 

He stops dead. Suddenly he realizes what he is saying.

CLOSEUP - DICKSON

As he reacts electrically to the mention of his wife.

CLOSE SHOT - CLUETT

He slaps a hand over his mouth, as if to crush out anything 
further he might say. He stares wide-eyed and frightened 
at Dickson.

242. CLOSE TWO SHOT - DICKSON AND CLUETT

Dickson glares at Cluett, penetratingly. His brain slowly 
absorbs the revelation that Phyllis was in Cluett's 
apartment the night before.

DICKSON
(dully)
My wife? What's she got to do with 
you?

INSPECTOR
(out of the side of 
his mouth - to a 
detective standing 
next to him)
No wonder he didn't want to mention 
her name.

Dickson comes over to Cluett, grabs him by the arm.

DICKSON
What was my wife doing in your 
apartment last night?

CLUETT
(hysterically)
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. 
Don't pay any attention to me. I 
don't know what I'm saying.

DICKSON
You just mentioned her name. What 
was she doing there? What was she 
doing in your apartment?

CLUETT
She just came up for a drink. Just 
for a few minutes.

Dickson grabs Cluett and shakes him.

DICKSON
(a shriek)
You're lying!

MED. CLOSE SHOT

INSPECTOR
Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll 
find out whether he's telling the 
truth. I'll have a man from 
headquarters check up on it right 
away.

DICKSON
(hard)
You don't want to check up on 
anybody. I'll do all the checking 
up. Wait a minute.

CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he crosses to his desk, and calls 
Helen on the intercom.

DICKSON
Helen!

HELEN'S VOICE
Yes?

DICKSON
Get Mrs. Dickson on the phone.

There is an awkward pause while Dickson waits. He is 
obviously agitated. Then the phone rings.

DICKSON
(answering it)
Listen, dear. I want to ask you 
something. I know it's a silly 
thing for me to ask you, but . . .  
I want you to tell me the truth. 
Where were you last night?

CUT TO:

INT. DICKSON HOME - CLOSEUP - MRS. DICKSON

MRS. DICKSON
(into phone - 
disconcerted)
Last night? Er - why - uh, last 
night . . .

CUT TO:

INT. DICKSON'S OFFICE - CLOSEUP - DICKSON

DICKSON
(very sombre)
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth 
about this. Were you in Cluett's 
apartment?

CUT TO:

INT. DICKSON HOME - CLOSEUP - MRS. DICKSON

MRS. DICKSON
(into phone)
In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, 
you see, I . . . I . . .

CUT TO:

INT. DICKSON'S OFFICE - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Favoring Dickson, but showing Cluett and the others.

Dickson slowly puts the phone receiver down. His face is 
ashen. He is shaken to the core.

CLUETT
(miserably)
She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. 
It wasn't her fault. Honest, it 
wasn't. I begged her to come up. 
She didn't 

DICKSON
(an explosion)
Get out, get out!

INSPECTOR
All right. Let's go.

The detectives get on either side of Cluett and silently 
they march him out of the room. Inspector and others follow, 
leaving Dickson alone. When they have gone out:

CLOSE SHOT - DICKSON

Left alone, he is a tragic figure. An incessant parade of 
disturbing thoughts tumble over each other in a hectic 
march across his chaotic mind. He grips his throbbing 
temples in an effort to crush out the torturous thought 
that Phyllis was involved in an intrigue with Cyril Cluett.

CUT TO:

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MED. SHOT

Most of the directors seem to be weakening. O'Brien is 
remaining staunch to Dickson. Clark alone, holds out.

O'BRIEN
Clark, you're insane to hold out 
any longer. Now let's get some 
money over here and stop this run.

AMES
If we close our doors, our stock 
won't be worth a nickel.

Meek little Ives once more tries to speak:

IVES
My dear friends, I 

O'BRIEN
(interrupting)
I'll lay you ten to one, Dickson 
won't give in.

250. CLOSER SHOT

Featuring Schultz and Clark, standing together.

SCHULTZ
Maybe they're right, Clark.

CLARK
(weakening)
All right, I'll go and have a talk 
with him.

As he starts to walk toward the door:

CUT TO:

INT. DICKSON'S PRIVATE OFFICE - FULL SHOT

Dickson sits at his desk, his head cupped in his hands. 
Clark enters thru door of outer office, quietly. He looks 
at Dickson a moment, then crosses to the desk.

CLARK
Oh, Dickson . . .

CLOSE SHOT OF THE TWO

Shooting toward Dickson.

Dickson slowly looks up at Clark.

CLARK
(softly)
Dickson, I'd like to talk to you 
about the bank.

DICKSON
(heartsick)
The bank. All right. Do anything 
you want with it.

CLOSE SHOT - CLARK

His face lights up. This is a turn he never expected. He 
really came in to capitulate.

CLARK
(smoothly)
Now you're talking sense.
(alert)
We'll draw up the option on your 
stock - say, eighty dollars a share. 
How's that?

CLOSE SHOT - DICKSON

He is not even interested, speaks vaguely:

DICKSON
Eighty dollars? That's fine - 
anything you say.

He waves Clark away.

CLARK
Good, good. I'll draw it up at 
once.

255. MED. SHOT

As Clark starts out of Dickson's office, elated, Helen 
comes in.

HELEN
You want the rest of those numbers, 
Mr. Dickson?

DICKSON
(toneless)
Numbers? No, never mind.

She stares at him, surprised, backs out of the room.

CUT TO:

INT. OUTER ROOM OF DICKSON'S OFFICE - HELEN AND MATT

IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING:

MATT
What's he doing, honey? Is he 
getting any help?

HELEN
Something's happened. He isn't 
trying anymore.

MATT
They must have turned him down.

HELEN
Yes. He called some of the biggest 
people in town.

MATT
Sure, they'd turn him down. He 
ought to know that. I'm going in 
there and talk to him.

AS HE ENTERS DICKSON'S OFFICE:

CUT TO:

INT. DICKSON'S OFFICE

CAMERA PANS ACROSS as Matt enters:

MATT
We haven't got much time left, Mr. 
Dickson. We've got to do something 
quick or it'll be too late.

DICKSON
(softly)
Why wouldn't you tell me where you 
were last night?

MATT
(ignoring the 
question)
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. 
Dickson?

DICKSON
Were you in Cluett's apartment?

MATT
(dismissively)
Oh, I can explain about that later. 
You're losing your bank - don't 
you realize what that means?

DICKSON
(gravely)
Was Mrs. Dickson there?

MATT
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let 
them lick you just because a couple 
of big shots turned you down. You've 
got more friends than anybody in 
this town. Little guys - guys who 
wouldn't be in business if it 
weren't for you. All you've got to 
do is 

DICKSON
(undeterred)
Wait a minute. Answer my question. 
Was Mrs. Dickson there?

MATT
(fumbling for words)
Well . . . uh . . . I . . .

DICKSON
She was, wasn't she? How long has 
this been going on? Do you know?

MATT
Aw, I don't know what you're talking 
about. All I know is that you're 
losing your bank and 

DICKSON
(firmly)
All right. That's all.
(poignantly)
Please, Matt.

Head bowed, Matt exits scene.

CUT TO:

INT. DICKSON'S OUTER OFFICE - MATT AND HELEN

IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING:

HELEN
Did you talk to him?

MATT
(downcast)
Yeah.
(he has a sudden 
inspiration)
I got an idea. Come on, let's get 
to a telephone.

They exit scene hurriedly.

CUT TO:

INT. DICKSON'S PRIVATE OFFICE - MED. CLOSEUP

All of his beliefs are shaken by this seeming betrayal. 
Dickson takes a framed photograph of Phyllis from his desk, 
gingerly sets it face down in the center drawer of his 
desk.

Also in the desk drawer is - he cannot help but notice - a 
gun.

CUT TO:

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - CLARK

As he dictates to someone off screen:

CLARK
a thirty-day option on ten thousand 
shares of stock of this company, 
now registered in the name of Thomas 
A. Dickson. Now make that in 
triplicate and get it to me just 
as fast as you can. Hurry!

CUT TO:

INT. SOMEWHERE IN THE BANK - CLOSE SHOT AT PAYROLL WINDOW

Shooting past cashier in f.g. towards line of laborers 
waiting to be paid.

Cashier stands in front of a tall counter upon which is a 
small metal box filled with currency. He is speaking into 
the phone by his side as scene opens.

He hangs up receiver and turns to the men on the other 
side of the window.

CASHIER
(speaking thru small 
window)
Sorry ladies and gentlemen, there's 
no more money. You'll have to go 
on to the next window.

He snaps the window shut, slams down cover of little metal 
box.

Angry ad-lib from line of laborers waiting to be paid.

CUSTOMER AD-LIBS
What do you mean there's no more 
money? etc.

Panicked shouting and pushing. In the center of the crowd, 
a woman faints.

CUT TO:

Another cashier, another window, another angry line of 
depositors.

CASHIER
That's all there is!

More pushing, shouting, angry ad-lib.

CUT TO:

INT. DICKSON'S OUTER OFFICE - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Phyllis Dickson, serious-faced, comes up steps and thru 
ante room on the way to Dickson's private office.

She pounds on door of office. There is no reply from within. 
Standing next to her is a bank guard, uncertain about what 
to do. Throughout scene, there are b.g. sounds of melee in 
the bank.

MRS. DICKSON
(to bank guard)
Are you sure he's in there?

GUARD
Yes, ma'am. He must be in there. 
He hasn't come out.

She pounds on the door again.

MRS. DICKSON
(shouting)
Tom! Tom! Tom!
(to guard)
I've got to get in there. Can't 
you find me a key?

GUARD
(reaching into 
Helen's desk)
Yes, I think there's one right 
here in the drawer.

CUT TO:

INT. DICKSON'S PRIVATE OFFICE - FULL SHOT

As Mrs. Dickson rushes in.

Dickson is standing by a window.

CLOSE SHOT - MRS. DICKSON

She walks over to him - CAMERA PANNING WITH HER - and stands 
in back of him.

MRS. DICKSON
(softly - seriously)
Tom! Oh Tom, darling - I came to 
explain about last night . . .

Dickson remains silent. Mrs. Dickson continues:

MRS. DICKSON
Cyril Cluett doesn't mean anything 
to me, Tom. I went out with him 
last night simply because . . . 
well, I had begun to feel that I 
didn't have any part in your life. 
That I was an outsider. Tom, all 
we did was to go to the theatre, 
and then we went back to his 
apartment afterward for a drink. 
That's all it was. I didn't do 
anything wrong, Tom. I couldn't do 
anything wrong. I love you too 
much. You know that.

CLOSEUP - DICKSON

As he stares dully out the window.

Mrs. Dickson's voice coming over shot:

MRS. DICKSON
(breaking down - 
sobbing)
Oh, Tom! Tom!

CUT TO:

INT. SOMEWHERE IN BANK - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT - MATT AND 
HELEN

Favoring Matt.

They are furiously working two phones, going down a list 
of people who owe Dickson and the bank a favor.

Although Matt has focus in the scene, Helen's voice is 
always in b.g., as she handles calls, making the same pitch.

MATT
(into phone - rat-a-
tat)
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The 
run's getting worse.

HELEN
(simultaneously)
Mr. Williams . . .

MATT
(continuing)
The big guys have got the screws 
on him. You've got to come through 
for him, Mr. Conway. He came through 
for you a hundred times. If his 
friends don't help him, who is 
going to help him?

HELEN
(looking up from 
her own phone pitch)
Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!

CUT TO:

INT. LOBBY OF BANK - MED. SHOT

As a man elbows his way thru the crowd to a receiving 
teller's window. He is accompanied by a bank guard, who 
sweeps the disbelieving crowd aside. He speaks loudly for 
everyone's benefit:

JONES
Any bank that Tom Dickson has 
anything to do with is all right. 
I'm putting my money in here. Why 
should you be afraid? Give him a 
chance. Tom Dickson is all right! 
He's perfectly square. I'm putting 
my money in this bank! I know what 
I'm doing!

He reaches a teller's window, which is closed. He pounds 
on it.

JONES
Open up! I want to put some money 
in here! I don't want to take any 
out!

A teller's face appears, somewhat astonished.

TELLER
(recovering composure)
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! 
Charlie!

CUT TO:

INT. SOMEWHERE IN BANK - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MATT AND HELEN

MATT
(into the phone - 
rat-a-tat)
They're starting to come in already. 
Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't 
waste any time. Get all the money 
you can lay your hands on, and 
bring it down here right away. 
Step on it.

He hangs up, dials another.

Helen has dialed another prospect also, and hands the phone 
to Matt.

MATT
(to Helen)
Who's this?
(into one phone)
Mr. Williams?
(into the other 
phone)
Mr. Gunther?
(to Helen)
I'll talk to both of them at once.
(holding both phones 
up to his mouth)
Listen, both you fellows. Dickson's 
in a jam. The run's getting worse. 
Those big guys got the screws on 
him. Yeah, both you fellows got to 
come thru for him. Listen, if his 
friends don't help him, who is 
going to help him? Now he came 
through for you a hundred times. 
Yeah, listen. They're starting to 
come in already. Yeah, listen. 
Both of you fellas - get all the 
money you can lay your hands on, 
and bring it down here right away. 
Both of you - step on it! All right.

CUT TO:

INT. LOBBY OF BANK - MED. SHOT

As several more people elbow their way thru the crowd on 
their way to teller's windows, speaking aloud.

MAN
(loudly)
Get out of my way. I got money I 
want to put into the bank.

CAMERA PANS WITH HIM and second man until they reach the 
receiving teller's window, where they fall into a line 
already containing ten or twelve people.

The second man shoves his way to the front, and addresses 
the teller:

2ND MAN
I want to make a deposit. Four 
thousand, six hundred dollars. 
He's the best man in the world. I 
believe in him.

CUT TO:

INT. DICKSON'S PRIVATE OFFICE - CLOSE TWO SHOT

Dickson and Phyllis Dickson. She is still explaining to 
him.

MRS. DICKSON
It doesn't matter what you think 
about me, there's something far 
more important. Those people down 
there. The bank, Tom. You can't 
give that up.

She is interrupted by sound of door opening. They look 
off.

CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR

As Sampson steps in. He looks off toward Dickson.

SAMPSON
Mr. Dickson!  Come here a minute. 
Look at this. Something wonderful 
has happened. People are bringing 
deposits. You won't believe it 
until you see it. You have to come 
out.

272. CLOSE SHOT

Dickson and Mrs. Dickson. He shambles over towards the 
door.

INT. OUTSIDE OF DICKSON'S OFFICE - MED. CLOSE SHOT

As Sampson and Dickson come out from private office.

SAMPSON
(pointing off)
Look!

Dickson gazes in the direction he points.

CUT TO:

274. RECEIVING TELLER'S WINDOW - MEDIUM SHOT

From Dickson's angle.

The line has grown in size. Those trying to deposit their 
money are just as excited as those who want to draw it 
out.

MAN
(shouting)
Tom Dickson is a friend of mine! 
I'll put money in his bank any 
time!

ANOTHER MAN
(shouting)
Anybody who takes money out of 
this bank is crazy! I'm going to 
put a lot of money in! Here it is!

3RD MAN
I haven't got much, but here it 
is!

WOMAN
Tom Dickson can have all my money 
any time.

CUT TO:

INT. OUTSIDE OF DICKSON'S OFFICE - CLOSEUP

On Dickson, looking toward Receiving Teller's window. He 
stares at the miraculous spectacle, deeply moved. He can 
scarcely believe his own eyes. A smile grows on his face.

The sight of his friends coming to his rescue has an 
electrical effect on Dickson. It revives his fighting 
spirit. He sticks his jaw out determinedly. Without a word 
he turns and crosses to door of conference room.

CUT TO:

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - FULL SHOT

Dickson flings the door open. Clark and the other directors 
are startled out of their business. Clark holds the 
necessary transfer papers in his hand.

DICKSON
Come out here you pawnbrokers - 
take a look at this!

CLARK
We've been waiting fifteen minutes 

DICKSON
(waving papers away)
You know what you can do with that! 
Come on, take a look at this!  
You'll see a demonstration of faith 
that's worth more than all the 
collateral in the world.

While he has been speaking, several of the directors have 
edged over to the door. They are perceptibly impressed.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - CLARK

He has remained unmoved, staring at Dickson, as if trying 
to determine what kind of ruse is this.

DICKSON'S VOICE
Come on boys! Come on Clark! It'll 
do your heart good.

CAMERA PANS WITH CLARK, as he crosses slowly to the door 
and looks out.

DICKSON
Look at that. They're shoving their 
hard-earned money across the counter 
with a ten to one chance against 
them.

CLOSER SHOT OF GROUP

As they edge out onto balcony overlooking scene.

DICKSON
If you fellas want to save this 
bank, get some real money over 
here right away.

O'BRIEN
(decisively)
That's enough for me, Dickson. I'm 
ashamed of myself. I'll have a 
hundred thousand dollars over here 
in five minutes.

O'Brien starts away and crosses to a phone.

Dickson turns to the others.

DICKSON
Now you're talking! Ames?

AMES
I'm sold.

He goes off.

DICKSON
All right. Schultz?

SCHULTZ
(only a moment's 
hesitation)
This is your bank, Dickson, and 
I'm with you!

DICKSON
Ives?

CLOSE SHOT - IVES

At last he can say something.

IVES
(shaky voice)
My dear friends, that's what I've 
been trying to say all afternoon.

DICKSON
Go ahead and say it.
(turning to Clark)
Clark, you can do twice as much as 
any of them. How about you?

CLOSE SHOT - CLARK

CLARK
Oh, I don't agree with you, but if 
everybody's gone crazy, I'll go 
crazy too!

CUT TO:

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - SERIES OF CLOSEUPS

As Clark and the other directors make their urgent phone 
calls.

SCHULTZ
(into phone)
This is Ben Schultz talking. Send 
a hundred thousand cash over here 
to the Union National right away.

CLARK
(into phone)
Send all your available cash to 
Union National!

AMES
(into phone)
Currency - small denominations 

CLARK
(into phone)
in tens and twenties 

IVES
(into phone)
Say, I want one hundred and fifty 
thousand dollars over here right 
away.
(listens)
I am in my right mind. No, no, no. 
Not one hundred and fifty dollars. 
Say, listen you guys, one hundred 
and fifty thousand dollars. Yes!

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. CITY STREET - LONG SHOT

A string of armored cars speed toward camera, accompanied 
by an escort of eight motorcycle cops. The procession 
heralds its approach by the piercing wail of sirens.

POLICEMAN
Open up!

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BANK - AT THE DOOR

A dozen policemen precede the entrance of a parade of 
uniformed guards, who carry in one hand sacks of money, 
their other hands clasped firmly on their guns. The crowd 
in the lobby stands aside, awe-stricken.

AD-LIB FROM COPS
Heads up 
Make way, there 
Hey, you, look out!

Murmurs of approval are heard from the crowd.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BANK NEAR FRONT DOOR - MED. SHOT

As the crowd is leaving the bank. Everyone is smiling and 
happy.

CAMERA SINGLES OUT VARIOUS INDIVIDUALS.

MAN
(to nearby man)
That's the trouble with people 
nowadays. They hear a crazy rumor, 
and right away they lose their 
heads. Not me! You didn't see me 
drawing my money out, did you?

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BANK - CLOSEUP - GERT

As she works the switchboard - the next day.

GERT
Good morning. Union National Bank. 
Just a minute . . .

INT. BANK VAULT - MEDIUM SHOT - GROUP OF TELLERS

As they gather for their morning ritual, waiting for Matt.

CHARLIE
Nine o'clock and all is lousy.

TELLER
Where's Matt?

CHARLIE
Ten to one he'll have a crack about 
the run yesterday.

TELLER
It's a cinch bet. I wouldn't take 
it.

2ND TELLER
If he pulls a gag about the run, 
we'll murder the guy. Murder him!

They hear Matt approaching, and gesture silence. Matt 
strides purposefully in. He works the mechanism on the 
vault. There is a long silence, during which nobody says 
anything, most surprisingly of all, not even Matt. Finally:

MATT
(after having opened 
the lock - turning 
to the group of 
expectant tellers)
Well, I suppose you guys had a 
good run for your money yesterday!

They tackle him to the ground.

CUT TO:

INT. BANK ENTRANCE MED. - CLOSE SHOT

As Dickson enters, and playfully pushes the hat down over 
Gardiner, the old bank guard's face. The bank guard adjusts 
his hat, annoyed, then sees it is the president of the 
bank.

GARDINER
(merrily)
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife 
is much better this morning.

DICKSON
Well, that's too bad. Mine's all 
right too.

Guard puzzles over his non-sequitur for a moment, then 
smiles.

CAMERA TRUCKS AHEAD OF DICKSON, as he strides through the 
lobby, passing various individuals from opening scenes.

He spots the teller with a habit of smoking on the job.

DICKSON
Carter!

The teller, from Dickson's angle, holds up his empty hands. 
No cigarettes. Then, he opens his mouth and chews 
elaborately, showing that he has switched to gum.

Hellos and Good Mornings greet Dickson as he continues on 
his way. He passes the janitor in a new uniform, and stops 
him.

DICKSON
Well, well, well - got your uniform, 
eh?

JANITOR
Yes, sir.

DICKSON
Looks good. How much did it cost?

JANITOR
(proudly)
I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought 
it for me.

Dickson opens his jacket, affects an unenthusiastic perusal 
of his own well-worn suit of clothing.

DICKSON
(cheerfully)
Oh-oh. I guess I'll have to see 
Sampson myself.

CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM as he approaches Helen's desk outside 
his own private office. Helen looks up.

DICKSON
Good morning, Helen.

HELEN
Good morning.

DICKSON
Say, I know what's the matter with 
you. Matt!

Matt, hearing his name, dashes up to stand next to Dickson.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

DICKSON
I want you both to take the day 
off. Go downtown and get a license 
and get married right away!

MATT
(weakly)
But I haven't . . .

DICKSON
I don't want to hear any more about 
it. If you don't get married, I'll 
fire both of you.

By now they are beaming. Dickson starts off, then has a 
second thought.

DICKSON
Helen, while you're downtown, you 
might stop in and make reservations 
for the bridal suite on the 
Berengaria sailing next week.

MATT
Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson 

HELEN
Oh!

DICKSON
(cutting him off)
Oh, no! It's not for you. You're 
only going to get married. Mrs. 
Dickson and I are going to go on 
the honeymoon.

With just the barest suggestion of a wink, he exits.

MATT LOOKS AT HELEN:

MATT
Come, on slave.

They exit arm in arm.

TITLE

on black screen above center:

NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE UNITED STATES

o.s., quiet, but swiftly louder, the humming, then hammering 
of rails; then over this, increasing SOUND, the SOUND of a 
hoarse, old-fashioned train whistle coming swiftly nearer: 
two long blasts, one short, one long, which trails down and 
out.

Over the fading train whistle and increasing train SOUND

FADE IN:

TITLE

below center:

TOWARDS THE END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY

Start the rapid SOUND of a train bell. SWOOP SOUND of bell 
and train up suddenly two seconds before

CUTTING TO:

CLOSE SHOT -- A TRAIN (NITE)

Instantly bring SOUNDS of train and bell up as loud as the 
audience can stand. A transcontinental express-train crosses 
through r.s. to l.s. at frightening velocity. CAMERA is 
pulling back from a close shot at medium height of the train. 
In the train's wake, a long, luminous ruche of snow is raised, 
filling the screen, and slowly sinking, as SOUNDS dwindle 
o.s.

As the last snow settles to the ground, and the SOUNDS die 
o.s., the CAMERA ends its pull-back about 12 feet off the 
ground in a

LONG SHOT -- EXT. A STATION, A SMALL HOTEL, A SMALL TOWN, 
THE PRAIRIE -- IN DARKNESS AND SILENCE

It is not snowing and the night sky is overcast but the snow 
on the ground gives off enough light -- using infra-red if 
need be -- to establish the station (extreme l.s.), the hotel 
(dead center), the edge of the town (extreme r.s.). Even in 
darkness the hotel gives off something odd and curdled. Beyond 
and between these buildings, as our eyes become accustomed 
to the darkness, we see an immense perspective of snowed 
land, and a very distant low horizon against a black sky 
which holds two thirds of the screen.

HOLD THIS DARKNESS perhaps eight seconds Then, within a 
maximum thirty seconds, the darkness alters through the lights 
of pre-dawn, dawn, etc., to the light of late morning. At 
the proper early juncture, one or two small lights appear in 
windows, and go out again. At the edge of the town, in the 
earliest real daylight, a man's tiny figure comes out of a 
door and walks out of r.s. Little flags of smoke and steam 
sprout, compact and crisp, in the bitter air. Shading and 
detail become increasingly clear. The station is coal-black; 
its sign FORT ROMPER, is just readable. The town is mostly 
low, mean, frame construction -- the drab shades of tired 
blotting-paper. The Hotel, of a disturbing shade even in 
darkness, gives off under the changing light an always more 
and more sinister and unearthly fish-belly glare. Its sign, 
PALACE HOTEL, is newish, and easy to read. It is a crummy 
rather frail-looking wooden building of two stories, crowned 
by florid cornice work.

Beyond these buildings we can see perhaps forty miles. The 
sky is dull gray; the snow is like rice; there are farms, at 
lonely distances apart.

When high, shadowless morning light is established, the tiny 
silhouette of a man -- SCULLY -- walks briskly out of the 
Hotel front door and towards the station. o.s., begin and 
bring up SOUNDS of an overworked locomotive and a train; he 
walks faster; bring up the SOUNDS; he trots; a somewhat 
archaic locomotive, crusted and bearded with ice and snow, 
slowing, drags on from l.s. a baggage car, a daycoach, the 
first of a string of boxcars; covering SCULLY as he trots; 
stopping. As quickly as will not be be absurd, SCULLY 
reappears, walking towards the Hotel, followed by the COWBOY, 
the EASTERNER, the SWEDE, in single file. At the same moment, 
the CAMERA, which is centered on the hotel door, starts 
towards the door at their pace, holding them within left-
screen. We get at first only character by silhouette and 
near-silhouette, then in more detail.

SCULLY is in the lead, half-turning as he walks, to talk; 
short, chunky, late middle-aged. Next, the COWBOY, size and 
structure of John Wayne, tight city trousers, a solid block 
of mackinaw, his best hat; he walks like a horseman and with 
the stooping, rather diffident stride of a man of his height; 
he carries a scarred raw-hide suitcase or a splotched Holstein-
hide roll-grip. Next, the EASTERNER. He is small, slender, 
bears himself well and entirely without the bumptiousness of 
so many small men. Without at all mincing, he is more neat-
footed along the icy boards than the others are; he carries 
a briefcase and a middle-sized, neutral valise, possibly 
with faded labels on it. Last, the SWEDE: He is above average 
height but stocky enough to seem shorter than he is, and 
disturbed and scared enough, as a rule, to sag an inch or 
two more. A shiny black leather coat to the middle of the 
thighs, trousers which look as if he had on two suits of 
long underwear beneath them, a cap of coarse hairy wool, two 
sizes too small, high on his head, with earflaps which at 
best cannot thoroughly cover his ears. There is something 
shaky, equivocal and arythmic about his walking. An outsize 
new suitcase which looks to be covered by black oilcloth 
increases his clumsiness at the knees.

As these men grow out of silhouette into detail and size, 
and we begin to hear their SOUNDS, the CHOWF-CHOWFINGS of 
the locomotive, o.s., drown out these SOUNDS and the 
locomotive and the train, gathering speed, cut off the men 
from view and then fill most of the screen, the Hotel still 
jutting above. As locomotive makes r.s., the CAMERA is quite 
close to train and place-names, emblems and names of lines, 
swinging by, suggest the whole nation and continent in 
geography and history.

CUT OR LAP:

DISSOLVE TO:

MEDIUM TWO SHOT -- FACADE OF HOTEL -- DOOR AT CENTER

The CAMERA is still creeping, lowering quietly to eye height. 
o.s. SOUNDS of walking on icy boards. The four men enter, 
in single file and in the same order, at l.s. SCULLY steps a 
pace past his door and wheels and stops abruptly, bowing 
slightly and flinging out one hand in a slightly uneasy parody 
of Mine Host and causing the others to stop or tread water 
in uneasy courtesy, indulging his spiel. The CAMERA stops 
creeping at the same moment; they are medium close. The 
EASTERNER looks quietly and curiously at the strange color.

EASTERNER
(politely concealing 
his faint nausea)
I've never seen the shade before, 
but once.

SCULLY
(a little jealous, 
but very polite)
And where might that be, may I ask?

EASTERNER
On the legs of a kind of heron; one 
of the wading birds. It's a very 
strange color; there's nothing else 
quite like it in Nature. It declares 
the bird's position against any 
background.

SCULLY
Declares his -- does it now! Well 
now, surely that's a mischievous hue 
for the Almighty to paint a poor 
craytcher in this murderin' world. 
Declare me position indeed. Aginst 
inny background. That's nicely put. 
That's it in a nutshell. You kin see 
the Palace Hotel for miles up the 
line, all weathers, and she's starin' 
like the morning star. Now didn't 
ye? And do ye truly admire it?

EASTERNER
It's a very remarkable shade.

SCULLY
Ahh, count on a traveled man for 
connisewership! But gintlemen, may 
heaven forgive me an' me guests 
rattlin' their teeth on me own 
doorstep.
(he hurries to open 
the door and wave 
them past him)
Come in! Come in!
(to Johnnie)
One twenty-two three an' -- No, line 
'em up along the south corridor and 
don't let the grass grow under yer 
feet. Hang yer coats in here, 
gintlemen, unless ye prefer to go 
straight to yer rooms.

AD LIBS
No. -- No, thanks.

SCULLY
(continuing)
Let's thaw ourselves out a bit; ye 
can sign up at yer layzhure. Not 
that ev'ry room in me establishment 
ain't as warm as toast, gintlemen, 
but in weather the likes o' this, ye 
should have the binifit o' the lee 
o' house.

AD LIBS
Sure. -- Of course, thanks.

SCULLY
Now here's something, friends, ye 
couldn't hope to find in the Waldorf. 
Ye see?
(he pours a slashing 
tinkle of ice-
splintery water into 
the first basin)
What would ye git there?
(contemptuously)
Shteem! Where fer the chills there's 
nuthin' on earth to set the blood 
hummin' agin like a bit o' nice brisk 
water.
(Meantime, he is 
filling two more 
basins)
Ye don't believe me?
(to the Easterner)
Don't be shy! try it! You'll see.
(The Easterner plunges; 
the instant the water 
hits his face he 
utters four sharp 
coughs, but he stays 
at it and emerges 
gasping and groping; 
Scully produces a 
towel he grabbed 
from a shelf under 
the tub and now says 
with an air of great 
graciousness)
Yer towel, sir.

SCULLY
Yer towel, sir.
(same old towel)

DOLLY along to the Swede, eyes downcast and shifting a little; 
he plants his heavy fingers in the water up to their second 
knuckles, and quickly withdraws them, quailing profoundly.

SCULLY
(handing out the towel, 
now quite draggled, 
politely but with 
less enthusiasm)
Yer towel, sir.

The Swede sinks one finger at a time into the towel and 
twists.

CLOSE UP -- THE EASTERNER

He is looking into a mirror. His skin shines as if he had 
used some kind of metal polish on it; he is quietly surprised 
and pleased. He glances down casually to see if his nails 
are clean.

CLOSE UP -- THE COWBOY

Also gazing into the mirror. He has the same burnished look 
of metal polished. Impersonal light eyes, a little bit bovine, 
very virile and empty, fixed through most of the shot on his 
hair, which he is tidying with a public comb. His eyes rake 
down, casually and impersonally across his face at the finish 
of the shot.

CLOSE UP -- THE SWEDE

He is twisting his fingers, one by one, heavily in the towel; 
by the angle of his eyes and their surreptition, it is clear 
that he is very carefully watching the other three men in 
the mirror. At the end of the shot, Scully walks into it as 
the Swede drops the towel beside the basin. The Swede turns 
for the door, Scully picks up the towel, tosses it into a 
cardboard box, CAMERA SWINGING as they make for the door.

SCULLY
(in re the towel)
Thank you.
(calling after them)
Now just make yerselves comfortable 
by the stove, gintlemen. It won't be 
no time till dinner.

They start through the door.

MEDIUM CLOSE -- THE MAIN ROOM

Past stove on the FARMER as he glances up and starts to edge 
back his chair to make room.

FARMER
Mean weather.

COWBOY
Mean enough.

FARMER
Seven below, last night.

COWBOY
That a fact.

FARMER
Warmed up a leetle, but it's jest 
makin' fer more snow.

COWBOY
Snowin' a'ready.

FARMER
Big wind acomin' too, shouldn't 
wonder.

COWBOY
Shouldn't wonder.

FARMER
No sir, shouldn't wonder if we git 
us a real ole fashion' blizzard. If 
ye don't mind my askin', stranger, 
where might ye be from?

COWBOY
I was down to Omahaw; a little 
business.

FARMER
An' where might ye be headin'?

COWBOY
Got me a little ranch, up near the 
Dakota line.

FARMER
That a fact? Stoppin' over fer the 
Spur train, 's 'at right?

COWBOY
That's right.

FARMER
Myself, I'm a farmer.

COWBOY
That right?

FARMER
Yup. That's right. Started as a 
homesteader, back in seventy-six, 
but now I own muh land.

COWBOY
Uh huh.

FARMER
Quarter section.

COWBOY
That right?

FARMER
Yup. Quarter section. When I come 
here it warn't nuthin' but a untamed 
wilderness like you might say. But 
now I own me a quarter section.

A silence. Farmer spits again, then addresses the Easterner.

FARMER
An' what might yer own business be, 
stranger, if ye don't mind my askin'?

EASTERNER
Not at all, sir. I'm a journalist. 
Newspaper man.

FARMER
Now is that a fact?
(carefully)
Not meaning no offense, you're from 
the east, ain't you?

EASTERNER
(smiling)
Yes.
(against his natural 
reticence)
A Philadelphia paper.

FARMER
Is that right now. Well, not meanin' 
no offense, I'm mighty glad to hear 
that.

EASTERNER
(smiling)
Why's that, sir?

FARMER
I was skeered ye might be from Noo 
York City. Not that I've ever laid 
eyes on one, an' o' course, it could 
be I heared wrong. But what ye hear 
tell...
(a half silent 
whistling whew with 
a shake of the head)
...them Noo Yorkers!
(Uneasy glance at the 
Swede; tactful change 
of subject)
But they ain't never nuthin' happens 
out here, Mister, not that's fer the 
nooze papers. -- Is they?

EASTERNER
Well, you see, I'm not after news 
stories just now.
(politely)
Back east we're all so ignorant of 
the rest of the country, that's all. 
I am too, and I don't like to be 
ignorant. I just want to learn what 
things are really like, If I can, 
and tell others who don't know, you 
see.

FARMER
(chews it over, 
interested but puzzled)
An' they'll pay ye a livin' fer that?

EASTERNER
(smiling)
That's right.

FARMER
But if ye don't mind me askin', why 
how come ye coms to Rawmpr? Ain't 
nuthin' ever happens here.

EASTERNER
(careful and very 
polite but candid)
Frankly I didn't know I was getting 
off till I got here. Seeing it from 
the train, I just felt I couldn't go 
on by without seeing more of the 
Blue Hotel.

FARMER
Blue Hotel! Oh! You mean right where 
we're sett'n'?

The Easterner nods, smiling.

FARMER
Well, I ain't no proper jedge, but 
the woman, she thinks it's mighty 
purty.

EASTERNER
I never saw a color like it. Not on 
a hotel.

FARMER
Is that a fact now? Well I'll be 
dogged.
(pause. To the Swede)
An' how 'bout you, Mister, if ye 
don't mind me askin'? Where might 
you be from?

DISSOLVE TO:

MOVING CLOSE SHOT -- ALCOVE OF THE DINING ROOM

CAMERA VERTICAL over the dining table, starting at the head, 
pulling down along the aisle of places moderately slow. 
Perhaps one or two heads ad lib into the shot, ducking over 
the plate for a bite, but except for this, heads are not 
visible -- only what is on the table, and the busily eating 
and reaching hands. Subdued SOUNDS of shy, speechless, hungry 
eating. The food is all on the table and by evidence of damage 
done, we are well on into the meal. Voices are very sporadic 
and ad lib, possibly recognizable; close to monosyllabic and 
wholly utilitarian except for the Easterner.

AD LIBS
Meat please... Pass the potatoes... 
Turnips.

They are passed, used and returned without comment. A hand 
and fork reach to spear a biscuit.

EASTERNER
Could I have the butter, please.

An almost inaudible "Sure," in reply and

EASTERNER
(quietly)
Thanks.

The voices are o.s., such hands as reach deeper into the 
terrain than the eating plates, appear at unpredictable angles 
and rhythms; perhaps two might also collide and spring apart 
with the almost electric-shock celerity of shy courtesy. Not 
more than ten seconds to this VERTICAL PULL before we begin 
to hit barren space, the tundra-like lower reaches of the 
table, all much-mended, not perfectly clean, white tablecloth, 
no places set. After just a little of this, CAMERA begins to 
tilt and settle so that as it reaches the end of the long 
table, (room for a crowded 14) it is at eye level of a seated 
man looking up the center of the table at Scully at the head. 
Along l.s., the Swede (next Scully), and Johnnie; r.s., the 
Cowboy, (next to Scully) then the Easterner and the Farmer. 
We pause just long enough to get a glimpse of Scully's 
character through his eating: a business-like but rather 
frugal and finicky eater, even a touch of old-maidishness; 
an old fashioned and rather cute old guy; absorbed in eating, 
he loses entirely his Mine Host mannerisms, he's just an 
aging pappy at home, reloading. Rather frail eyelids and 
stretched neck when he drinks water; an evidently self-taught 
but deeply habitual care to take small bites and to keep his 
lips closed over his chewing; dabby with his fork; delicate 
at harpooning a biscuit; a suggestion of dental plates which 
don't quite fit.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE SWEDE

A big napkin is tied under his ears, its knot-ends make spare 
ears below his own. He is sweating a little. He uses his 
fork left-handed and upside down, European style. He eats 
steadily with heavy square gestures, and we see in his eating 
and chewing a conflict between the hunger of a fairly heavy 
eater and his uneasiness. He is intensely silent and his 
eyes are darting all over the joint with a dog's eating-
vigilance plus his own special kind of uneasiness. Elbows 
wide and clumsy, he usually grazes Johnnie and as CAMERA 
pulls to the left losing the Swede and picking up Johnnie, 
the elbows collide rather hard and the first we see of 
Johnnie's face involves a spasm of annoyance.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE COWBOY FROM JOHNNIE'S ANGLE

The Cowboy is winking at Johnnie, amused.

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHNNIE

He watches the Swede. A small, sour smile, friendly eyes, in 
reaction to the Cowboy. His eating is the normal fast heavy 
eating of a not very well mannered, far from meek, kid, 
exactly on the watershed between being a boy and a very young 
man.

CLOSE UP -- THE COWBOY

A napkin tucked fairly high into his dark shirt, his large 
elbows held in with unaccustomed tightness. His eating system 
is to mash whatever can be mashed into malleable material, 
mix it, load his fork by help of his knife as heavy as 
possible, sculpture and trim it with his knife; changes fork 
to right hand, brings it up to a mouth which opens for it 
and closes over it as efficiently as a steamshovel, then 
working his full jaws with a fair amount of SOUND which he 
keeps reasonably subdued, meanwhile lowering his fork, 
changing hands, and starting all over again. He swallows 
exactly as soon as the new load is ready and takes a swallow 
of water just before shifting the fork to the right hand: 
solid machine-like reciprocation between knife, fork, left 
hand, right hand, mouth and water glass. Otherwise, as a 
rule, his eyes are either attentive to his plate, or out of 
focus.

PULL CAMERA TO THE RIGHT, losing the Cowboy and picking up 
the Easterner: his are the ordinary eating manners of a well-
brought-up middle-class Easterner, shaded by his own 
considerable natural elegance. The modestly hearty appetite 
of a small healthy man. Small, strong, fine hands. As with 
his way of speaking, he neither obtrudes nor tries to conceal 
or modify what is natural to him or to his background. He is 
a clear master at seeing everything there is to be seen 
without appearing to stare, or to sneak glances, or even to 
look, or even to be careful not to look. As the CAMERA leaves 
him, PULLING RIGHT, he touches his mouth with his napkin, 
which has been in his lap.

TAIL OFF briefly on the Farmer, napkin tucked broad over bib 
of overalls, hard, heavy-knuckled red-looking hands: looking 
at nobody; hoeing it in; an aging, hard working countryman, 
at home at this table, and unself-conscious of strangers.

MEDIUM SHOT -- THE WHOLE TABLE FROM THE EMPTY END

They are all eating slower, the tail-end of the meal. AD LIB 
and unobtrusively behind this, is Scully's daughter moving, 
waiting on table, silently. She is a pale, melancholic, pious, 
once-pretty spinster of about 30. By-play and reaction between 
her and the diners should be present but minimal, and played 
ad lib in passing, never pointed up.

Scully rearranges himself to lean back in his chair and puts 
his hands on the table. A heavy silence as they dab at their 
food.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE SWEDE

His eyes angle sharply to the Cowboy and then to the 
Easterner.

TWO SHOT -- THE EASTERNER AND THE COWBOY FROM SWEDE'S ANGLE

The Easterner catches the Swede's eye, looks quickly down. 
The Cowboy's eyes up; down. The Easterner looks up again 
with an inevitable tinge of surreptition.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE SWEDE

The Swede is disturbed by the Easterner's look; glances 
sharply to the Cowboy.

TWO SHOT -- THE EASTERNER AND THE COWBOY FROM SWEDE'S ANGLE

The Cowboy looks up with inevitable surreptition.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE SWEDE

The Swede is still more worried. Gives Scully a sharp glance.

CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY FROM THE SWEDE'S ANGLE

He looks up at the worried look, quickly down again; up again, 
slyly.

CLOSE SHOT -- THE SWEDE

Eyes sidelong to Johnnie, very sly and worried, then to the 
Easterner and the Cowboy, intensely suspicious and deeply 
worried.

TWO SHOT -- THE EASTERNER AND THE COWBOY FROM THE SWEDE'S 
ANGLE

The Cowboy looks up in flat perplexity; the Easterner looks 
up in curiosity so veiled it looks almost criminal; then he 
looks down; then the Easterner and the Cowboy glance toward 
each other, each rather secretly, checking if the other had 
noticed anything odd; it looks very much like complicity.

CLOSE SHOT -- THE SWEDE

Very deeply bothered, he rakes his glance at each man in 
turn, then sharply up at the wall above Scully.

INSERT: WALL ABOVE SCULLY FROM SWEDE'S ANGLE A SOMBER STEEL 
ENGRAVING OF "THE STAG AT BAY."

CLOSE SHOT -- THE SWEDE

The Swede's eyes leave the engraving, quick glances all around 
again; he is sweating. He looks into his plate and at his 
heavy hands on either side of it. He is working hard to brace 
himself, he begins to get brave and to resolve himself; at 
last he determines to speak.

SWEDE
(to Scully)
Me, I come from New York City.

The Swede casts quick somber eyes at the Farmer.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE FARMER FROM THE SWEDE'S ANGLE

His fork hesitates a fraction near his mouth and goes in 
fast. The Farmer looks oven more absorbedly into his plate.

SCULLY
(juicily polite)
Do ye now! Now isn't that intristin'! 
Isn't that fascinatin'! A great city. 
Ah a great city. Well I remember me 
own arrival.

SWEDE
You come from New York too?

SCULLY
No, I only seen it fer a matter of 
days.

The daughter passes behind them; bread pudding to each.

SCULLY
My home was Bahstin Mass.

Every one quietly starting to eat dessert.

SWEDE
I lived there ten years.

SCULLY
Tin yearrs. Ye don't say. Tin years. 
A great city.

SWEDE
Before that I come from Sweden.

SCULLY
Ye don't say. Fine people, the Swedes.

SWEDE
In New York I was a tailor.

SCULLY
A tayylor! Ye don't say! A tailor ye 
say. Now isn't that simply 
fascinatin'.
(to the table at large)
The gintleman here tells me he was a 
tailor. Isn't that intristin'!

SWEDE
Yah: tailor.

SCULLY
Well sir, tailorin' I never learned. 
Ye might call me a jack of all trades 
and master o' none, exceptin' 
hotelkeeping...
(laughs modestly, 
glancing hopefully 
around the table)
...but tailorin', no, that's a mystery 
to me... It must be a fascinatin' 
trade.

SWEDE
(dead silence)

SCULLY
Hard on the eyes, maybe.

SWEDE
(More silence; his 
eyes go again to 
Scully; a kind of 
suspicion is in them, 
and in his voice)
How long you been here?

SCULLY
Fourteen years this last August I 
came here and I never had cause to 
regret it. A good town, sir. Good 
neighbors.

Scully beams a little nervously, glancing around.

SWEDE
What are the crops?

SCULLY
Wheat, sir. That's the main crop, ye 
might say the only crop. Wheat.
(Eyes and polite 
gesture to angle of 
Farmer)
Here's a man kin tell ye all there 
is to know about wheat, can't ye 
Henry? Henry's a wheat farmer.

The Cowboy and the Easterner are eating very quietly.

The Farmer nods, saying nothing.

SCULLY
Splindid soil. Rich as cheese. Some 
farms here, the yield is up to thirty-
five bushels to the acre.
(to the Farmer)
Isn't that correct?

The Farmer nods.

SCULLY
Last summer at the best it brought 
20 cents a bushel. So ye can readily 
see it's a prosperous community.
(A rather wretched 
smile)
Plain but prosperous.
(More silence)
There are farmers hereabouts who are 
to be accounted as wealthy men.
(Silence)
Farmers, mind ye.
(To table at large, 
almost pleadingly)
Wealthy!

MEDIUM SHOT -- SCULLY FROM THE SWEDE'S ANGLE

Appalled, his glasses wobble on his nose. SOUND of Swede's 
laughter o.s.

MEDIUM SHOT -- COWBOY, EASTERNER AND FARMER -- FROM SWEDE'S 
ANGLE

The Cowboy's jaw hangs open as if he were dead; in the 
Easterner, a far more sophisticated astonishment and 
wondering; the Farmer scowls more with puzzlement than anger; 
all dead silent, hands of all three arrested; continue Swede's 
laughter o.s.

CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE'S HEAD

Laughing and gleaming and glinting at them in great amusement 
and a glitter of fear.

GROUP SHOT -- FULL LENGTH OF TABLE

Towards Scully. Everyone motionless and silent except the 
Swede, all heads gawping at him: he is rocking with laughter 
and quietly raising his heavy hands an inch from the table 
and slapping them down again, over and over.

SLOW FADE:

FADE IN:

CLOSE SHOT -- THROUGH THE FRONT WINDOW OF THE MAIN ROOM

Extreme violence of snow and wind, the only visual anchorage 
is a blanched gate post leaning rigid into it. SOUNDS of 
strong wind, shut away, and of snow against the window pane. 
PULL BACK as Scully's aging hand releases a harsh ornate 
lace curtain he has pulled back, and BACK PAST SCULLY turning 
his face in CLOSE UP from the window, smiling, and announcing 
to the room at large:

SCULLY
A real old-fashioned blizzard, 
gintlemen.
(Almost proprietary 
about it)

FULL SHOT -- DOWN THE ROOM FROM SCULLY'S ANGLE

They are all filing in from the dining room past the stove 
in the profoundly relaxed few moments of shapeless drifting 
after a satisfying meal. In their whole demeanor and tone of 
voice there is absolute security; total lack of personal 
connection with the blizzard except the pleasure of being 
indoors.

EASTERNER
(forward along l.s. 
and drifting toward 
the center)
I should say it is.
(he continues leisurely 
across the room 
fishing in his pocket 
for a cigarette)

The Cowboy is a little behind the Easterner.

COWBOY
Sure looks like it.

A little right of center he slowly turns his back, getting 
out tobacco sack and papers. The Easterner by now is lighting 
up. The Swede walks much more slowly, beveling almost straight 
toward the CAMERA, deeper towards us than any of the others, 
eyes on angle of window; slowly prodding tobacco into his 
pipe. His comment is a scarcely audible breathing; in his 
face is already the beginning of a strange excitement as he 
watches through the window and approaches it.

SWEDE
(with a strange, 
private excitement, 
almost a whisper)
Yaahh!

The Farmer, meanwhile, swings in just behind the chairs at 
the stove. He utters the quiet gasp of total belly-
satisfaction, an "ahhh" not unlike Titus Moody's to Fred 
Allen, but earthier. He is loosening his belt and contentedly 
fingering through a gap in his shirt to scratch his belly. 
Johnnie is in, silent, between the chair and the stove. The 
Easterner starts glancing at the news headlines; the Cowboy 
starts slowly toward the stove; the Swede continues very 
ponderously and slowly toward the CAMERA and the window.

MEDIUM SHOT -- PAST EASTERNER TOWARD SCULLY; SWEDE IN B.G.; 
COWBOY LEAVING R.S.

SCULLY
(sharply)
Johnnie! Lay on more coal.

MEDIUM SHOT -- PAST EASTERNER TOWARD JOHNNIE BACK OF COWBOY 
AND FARMER

JOHNNIE
Want to burn the place down?

The Easterner turns to face the room. CUT IN MID-TURN.

MEDIUM SHOT -- SCULLY PAST EASTERNER

Advancing from the window and leaning to peer toward the 
stove.

SCULLY
Sure, it's rid hot now.

He comes down to the middle of the room, the CAMERA with 
him, losing the Swede, still talking.

SCULLY
(continuing)
I tell ye, friends, there's nuthin' 
like a chair beside a stove...

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE EASTERNER

His eyes and head following Scully who is already out of 
shot toward the stove. The Easterner is lazily and happily 
observant.

SCULLY'S VOICE
(o.s.)
...to make ye shpit 'n the eye...

MEDIUM SHOT -- FROM EASTERNER'S ANGLE TOWARD SCULLY and the 
group coalescing toward the stove.

SCULLY
(back to CAMERA)
...o' the worst weather Heaven kin 
send.

COWBOY
(absently; contentedly)
That's right.

The startling SOUND, o.s., of hollowed palms being clapped 
together.

MEDIUM SHOT -- SWEDE FROM EASTERNER'S ANGLE

Pipe clenched, a queer grin on his face, just finishing his 
handclap of solitary excitement and pleasure.

CLOSE UP -- EASTERNER

Much interested, his eyes flick from the Swede's angle to 
the angle of the stove and the group; the newspaper droops 
in his hand.

MEDIUM SHOT -- GROUP AT STOVE FROM EASTERNER'S ANGLE

They have noticed nothing.

SCULLY
Well, I'll be off about me dooties 
if you'll excuse me gintlemen.

COWBOY
Sure. So long.

EASTERNER'S VOICE
(o.s.)
Certainly.

Scully crosses up the room toward l.s. CAMERA FOLLOWING, 
losing the group.

JOHNNIE'S VOICE
(o.s.)
How 'bout it? Ready to get skinned 
alive again?

GROUP SHOT -- FROM EASTERNER'S ANGLE -- FARMER AT CENTER

FARMER
Son, day I see you skin a gopher 
I'll deed ye my farm, an' my old 
woman throwed in.

SOUND of a squeaky hinge across this.

MEDIUM SHOT -- SCULLY FROM EASTERNER'S ANGLE

Going through the little swinging gate by the registration 
desk.

GROUP SHOT -- JOHNNIE CENTERED

JOHNNIE
Be good thing for your land and a 
mercy for your wife.

COWBOY
Ouch!

FARMER
(approaching the table)
Jest get busy with that skinnin', 
son, loud talk never proved nuthin'.

COWBOY
(swinging chair into 
place)
I want to see this.

The Easterner walks into the shot as they severally arrange 
chairs, cards and chips and start to settle down.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- FARMER -- PAST JOHNNIE

Farmer sits in original position; Johnnie nearest the coatroom 
and with his back to it. They are cutting for deal and the 
Cowboy and the Easterner, who are doing the last necessary 
hiking of chairs, look on.

LONG SHOT -- SWEDE FROM SAME ANGLE

His rigid, leaning stance has been four feet or so from the 
window. He is now very close to the window and is just pulling 
under himself a small stool. o.s. THE SOUND of the oily whirr 
of expert shuffling.

CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE FROM THE SAME ANGLE

The window is beyond him, his eyes are fixed deep into the 
snow. o.s. SOUNDS of dealing and ad lib bidding. CAMERA PULLS 
SLOWLY around so that the Swede is in still larger close up, 
filling most of the screen. He is looking out intensely past 
the CAMERA, giving tiny, rapid pulls on his pipe; his face 
showing signs of an inexplicable excitement; eyes becoming 
almost dreamy. CAMERA SLOWLY TURNS square on the window to 
focus on what his eyes are fixed on, -- the post. Storm SOUNDS 
UP and card SOUNDS FADING to inaudibility. DISSOLVE to snow 
higher on post and, almost immediately, A LOUD SLAPPING DOWN 
OF CARDS and the Farmer's angry voice and the scrape of a 
chair.

EXTREME CLOSE UP -- SWEDE

Deep fright and guile in the face and a strange and malignant 
smile.

MEDIUM SHOT -- FARMER FROM JOHNNIE'S ANGLE

He is just finishing standing up, a look of heated scorn on 
his face.

JOHNNIE
Too bad. Poor feller just ought to 
leave cards alone.
(They nod; they are 
wholly on his side)
Or his temper, one or the other.

COWBOY
That's right. Ye can't afford a 
temper, not if ye play much cards.

EASTERNER
Or cards, if you have a temper.

COWBOY
(chuckles)
Mister, ya got sumpn' there.

JOHNNIE
How 'bout a whirl at four-handed; or 
do you reckon we can keep from bitin' 
each other's heads off?

COWBOY
(heavy jocosity)
Buster, my gun's right on the table 
so don't try nuthin' fancy.

EASTERNER
(smiling with Cowboy)
We might draw up a treaty of non-
aggression.

COWBOY
Reckon I'll throw in with you, 
Johnnie, you look like a mean man to 
have agin ye.

EASTERNER
(in a low voice)
Better make sure the Swede'll play.

COWBOY
Hey buddy.

JOHNNIE
Hey Mister.

EASTERNER
I beg your pardon.

SWEDE
Hehnh?

EASTERNER
I wondered if you'd be my par --

JOHNNIE
How 'bout a little game?

Uneasy but determined to show everyone that he is not afraid.

SWEDE
Yeh? What kind of a game?

JOHNNIE
High Five.

SWEDE
Never heard of it.

COWBOY'S VOICE
Some call it Cinch.

JOHNNIE'S VOICE
Ain't no cinch the way that poor 
Farmer plays it.

EASTERNER'S VOICE
Some call it Double Pedro.

COWBOY
Never knowed that.

SWEDE
Ohh. Yaah. Double Pedro. Is that it.

JOHNNIE
Five o' trumps yer Pedro, five o' 
same color's yer left,...

SWEDE'S VOICE
(across him)
Yah.

JOHNNIE
...ranks jest below yer five o' 
trumps, each count ya ten points.

SWEDE
Yaahh. Suure I played it.
(sharp pause)
For money you mean?

JOHNNIE
Either way suits me.

COWBOY'S VOICE
Let's just play for fun.

EASTERNER'S VOICE
Suits me.

COWBOY
(voice up)
Just for fun, if that suits you.

SWEDE
Fun. Yah. Yah. I play.

EASTERNER'S VOICE
(o.s.)
Fine.

They all pull up their chairs. The Swede laughs shrilly and 
strangely.

CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER FROM THE SWEDE'S ANGLE

He looks up quickly at the Swede (lens)

CLOSE SHOT -- COWBOY FROM JOHNNIE'S ANGLE

His jaw drops open, his head and eyes toward the Swede.

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHNNIE FROM THE COWBOY'S ANGLE

Not really looking except very quietly, 'as if from under 
his eyes', holding the cards with still fingers.

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHNNIE PAST COWBOY AND EASTERNER

His hands still suspended motionless.

JOHNNIE
Well, let's get at it. Come on now!

Faint nods of agreement and shiftings forward as they begin 
to cut for deal.

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHNNIE'S HANDS SHUFFLING THE CARDS

He is a very fast shuffler. We watch him finishing one whirr, 
and through another, then he puts the cards toward the Swede 
for the cut, the CAMERA FOLLOWING AND PULLING BACK. The Swede 
slowly and seriously cuts the deck three ways as the CAMERA 
RECEDES AND RISES to take in his face and Johnnie's. He is 
smiling at Johnnie who seems about to speak -- not quarrel-
somely exactly -- but lets it go and starts gathering in the 
deck.

CLOSE VERTICAL SHOT -- OVER TABLE

Johnnie deals very rapidly, three cards to a man at a time, 
the CAMERA following the cards around and the eyes of the 
four men following too. The Swede picks up his first three 
cards as quick as they fall, the others leave theirs on the 
table. He instantly takes them in so close to his chest that, 
in looking, he is like a woman looking down the front of her 
dress.

"CIRCULAR" SHOT

They all pick up their cards and look and arrange them.

CAMERA ON SWEDE -- EASTERNER'S VOICE BIDDING

CAMERA ON JOHNNIE -- COWBOY'S VOICE BIDDING

CAMERA ON EASTERNER -- SWEDE'S VOICE BIDDING

CAMERA ON COWBOY -- JOHNNIE'S VOICE PASSING

The Swede's VOICE names the trump suit.

VERTICAL SHOT OF TABLE

The players discard, face up. (They have been dealt nine 
cards each). They lay them down almost simultaneously: The 
Easterner 7, the Cowboy 7, the Swede 5 and Johnnie 8. The 
Cowboy WHISTLES softly.

THREE SHOT -- SWEDE CENTERED

Johnnie fills for them. 4 to the Easterner, 4 to the Cowboy 
and 1 to the Swede.

THREE SHOT -- JOHNNIE CENTERED

He robs the deck for 5 cards.

"CIRCULAR" SHOT

The Swede leads, Johnnie lays a card out, then the Easterner, 
then the Cowboy. The Cowboy lays his first card down quietly 
but already his face, especially the eyes, have strangely 
altered. He seems essentially quite a gentle guy but the 
usually rather slow eyes are bright and ruthless. THE SHOT 
CONTINUES to the Swede as he rakes in a trick and leads his 
next card; past Johnnie for his and the Easterner for his to 
the Cowboy who, with a face like the Archangel Michael goosing 
Satan, WHAMS down his card.

THREE SHOT -- SWEDE, JOHNNIE, EASTERNER

The instant the card hits the table with its startling noise, 
the Swede jumps with fright, is mad at being scared and flicks 
a smoldering, mean eye at the Cowboy.

Johnnie is mildly startled and quietly amused, much aware of 
the reactions of the other two.

The Easterner flinches with startlement; mildly annoyed; a 
little annoyed with himself for being annoyed; an automatic 
and almost successful effort to show nothing.

CAMERA ON SWEDE AND JOHNNIE -- THE SWEDE LEADING

CAMERA ON JOHNNIE AND EASTERNER -- JOHNNIE PLAYING

CAMERA ON EASTERNER AND COWBOY -- EASTERNER PLAYING

THREE SHOT -- FROM COWBOY'S ANGLE

As the hand and card WHAM down again, Johnnie's eyes go to 
the Cowboy, more amused. The two others take care not to 
look up.

CLOSE UP -- COWBOY FROM JOHNNIE'S ANGLE

He is on top of the world.

CLOSE UP -- THE SWEDE

SOUND of shuffling. His face has begun to darken, swell and 
crease; he is looking dull daggers toward the Cowboy from 
under his brows; sore as a boil. It is clear the Cowboy has 
busted hell out of his bid.

CLOSE UP -- EASTERNER

SOUND OF cowboy's VOICE bidding. The Easterner is sizing him 
up with care; he is a little annoyed and shaken, but a 
disciplined man.

CLOSE UP -- JOHNNIE

He is playing a card, eyes very watchful of his two opponents 
and still more amused. He knows how sore they are getting 
and how off-their-game it is putting them.

CLOSE UP -- COWBOY

Still more tickled with himself and more ruthless than before. 
WHAM.

COWBOY
Bullet by golly.

NEW CLOSE UP -- COWBOY

Still more so than before. WHAM.

COWBOY
Reckon that'll learn ye.

NEW CLOSE UP -- COWBOY

A card lifted high to wham, then laid out quite gently.

COWBOY
Reckon we'll leave um take this-un 
Johnnie-boy, sure looks like they 
could use it.

WHAM on CLOSE UP OF SWEDE By now boiling internally, he 
sullenly plays his card.

WHAM on CLOSE UP OF EASTERNER Managing almost perfectly to 
control his wincing and hide his anger.

WHAM on CLOSE UP OF JOHNNIE Eyes quick at Swede and the 
Easterner, just managing to hold in his laughter.

WHAM on CLOSE UP OF COWBOY Sweat bright on his forehead, his 
tie and collar loosened, impervious to their anger; happy as 
a clam.

WHAM on CLOSE UP OF JOHNNIE He can no longer contain his 
laughter.

WHAM on CLOSE UP OF EASTERNER Looking pinched around the 
nostrils and pretty sick.

CLOSE UP -- SWEDE

Ready for the wham; a light card falls.

COWBOY'S VOICE
(o.s.)
Reckon we can afford it.

The Swede does a quiet collapse equivalent to that of leaning 
against a strong wind which suddenly stops; Johnnie's laughter 
LOUDENS o.s. The Swede, still wearing coat and vest, is in a 
great state of dishevelment, sweating hard, miserable; by 
now he is as mad at quiet cards as at whams and as mad at 
Johnnie as at the Cowboy.

WHAM on CLOSE UP OF THE EASTERNER His vest unbuttoned, unable 
to sit up straight any more; he is smiling bitterly; SOUND 
of Johnnie's laughter intensifies o.s.

CLOSE UP -- JOHNNIE

Weak with laughter, but still at it; by now his shirt is 
unbuttoned down to the waist and he is sweating with laughter, 
laughing as much at the Cowboy as at the others.

CLOSE UP -- COWBOY

His large, thick, long red neck sprouting enormously from a 
tie and collar still more awry than before; aware he too is 
being laughed at but stolidly and hugely pleased with himself: 
eyes to all three players: WHAM.

The CAMERA lifts and loses his head and shoots over it and 
the slickening SOUND of the cards, up the length of the room, 
centering on the window and the wild snowing outside: ordinary 
full daylight: HOLD, fading the card SOUNDS and the laughter 
and the beat of wham almost to inaudibility and whiffling up 
the blizzard SOUNDS:

CUT TO:

SAME SHOT

Well into the beginning of dusk; a melancholy and slightly 
sinister light through the window, touching everything 
visible; fade card SOUNDS in and up, and Johnnie's laughter, 
much more tired and habituated; LOWER CAMERA to take Cowboy's 
head, the kind of guy who never knows when a joke stops being 
a joke; another full-sized WHAM;

CUT OVER JOHNNIE'S FIRST WORDS TO:

MEDIUM SHOT -- SWEDE, JOHNNIE, EASTERNER from COWBOY'S ANGLE 
Johnnie is practically sick with laughter; the other two are 
beat-out and sick to death of it. They are almost sorer at 
Johnnie than at Cowboy and show it in their hangdog glances 
at him.

JOHNNIE
Haahh, Lordy, I could die laughin'!

The Swede, and even the Easterner, flick him bitter glances. 
Johnnie relaxes still more limp in his chair, tears on his 
cheeks, catching their hard looks and totally unmoved; just 
another whicker of laughter at them.

COWBOY'S VOICE
(o.s.)
Your deal Johnnie, and you'd better 
give the other boys some cards for a 
change. They sure look like they 
could use a few.

JOHNNIE
Gett'n' chilly in here.
(looking up and around)
Hey, it's gett'n' dark.

MEDIUM SHOT -- FROM MIDDLE OF ROOM

They all look up and around towards the window and realize 
it for the first time. Johnnie gets up; behind the following 
lines he puts on coal:

EASTERNER
Hmm!
(he acts bemused coming 
out of deep 
concentration on the 
cards)

A pause. From mid-room, in the fading light, we watch them 
watching the darkening, the strange light on their faces, 
the faces calming, even saddening a little.

COWBOY
(quietly)
Snow sure does look blue, this time 
a day.

The Easterner nods; a little surprised that Cowboy notices 
it.

COWBOY
Funny, cause snow ain't blue, it's 
white. Snow white, like they say.

The Easterner smiles very quietly.

COWBOY
Reckon it's the light.

EASTERNER
(nods; then all but 
whispers)
Yes.

The Swede, throughout this, is deeply still and withdrawn; 
his face is preparing, inconspicuously, the strange line on 
which he will re-enter the conversation.

Johnnie, finished with the stove, crosses between CAMERA and 
the table to side table o.s., their eyes follow him quietly, 
light changes on their faces as, o.s., he lights and turns 
up a lamp.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- FROM SAME POSITION -- JOHNNIE

As he finishes with the lamp and leaves the shot, HOLD a 
moment on the lamp, its light tender and magical in the fading 
day, and disclosing their faces, still bemused in the 
ambiguous lightings of the last daylight and of lamplight on 
in daylight. There is a soft, strange point of light in each 
eye.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ON JOHNNIE -- PAST EASTERNER AND COWBOY

Johnnie reseats himself, pulls up, and gets the deck ready 
for shuffling; and their heads turn back from the lamp toward 
the game. Johnnie, realizing the shift and slowing of mood 
and influenced by it, dawdles a little, more or less idling 
and toying with the cards. A deeply pleasant and comfortable 
silence, tinged with the melancholy of dusk.

SLOW "CIRCULAR" SHOT --

Beginning on the Easterner's quiet face; then the Cowboy's 
(past him we see the whole room and the darkening window); 
then the Swede whose strange eyes still catch the lamplight; 
then Johnnie, ready to resume playing but waiting for them. 
This shot is to crown and epitomize the mysterious yet 
peaceful mood -- which is now broken by

SWEDE'S VOICE
(o.s., quiet and musing)
I suppose there have been a good 
many men killed in this room.

A short, electrified pause.

JOHNNIE
(quietly)
How's that?

MEDIUM SHOT -- COWBOY, JOHNNIE, EASTERNER -- FROM THE SWEDE'S 
ANGLE All looking at the Swede sharply.

CLOSE UP -- SWEDE

His eyes move to the Cowboy and the Easterner, then to 
Johnnie.

SWEDE
I said, I suppose there have been a 
good many men killed in this room.

CLOSE UP -- JOHNNIE -- FULL FACE

A short pause.

JOHNNIE
What the divil're you talkin' about?

QUICK, CLOSE FULL FACES OF THE COWBOY AND THE EASTERNER 
astounded and intensely curious.

CLOSE UP -- SWEDE

SWEDE
(a blatant laugh, 
full of false courage 
and defiance)
Oh, you know what I mean, all right!

CLOSE UP -- JOHNNIE

JOHNNIE
I'm a liar if I do!

FAST FLICKED CLOSE SHOTS OF EASTERNER, COWBOY AND JOHNNIE 
FROM THE SWEDE'S ANGLE

JOHNNIE
(very much the son of 
the proprietor)
Now, what might you be drivin' at, 
Mister?

CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE FROM EASTERNER'S ANGLE

SWEDE
(winks at Johnnie, a 
wink full of cunning)
Oh, maybe you think I have been to 
nowheres. Maybe you think I'm a 
tenderfoot?

JOHNNIE
I don't know nuthin' about you and I 
don't give a whoop where you've been. 
All I got to say is I don't know 
what you're drivin' at. There hain't 
never been nobody killed in this 
room.

COWBOY
(a sudden swing of 
his whole head toward 
the Swede)
What's wrong with you, Mister?

ALL FROM SWEDE'S ANGLE, AT SPEED OF FLICKING EYES: Cowboy 
with the Easterner in the b.g. and slightly blurred focus; 
Johnnie with the Easterner in the b.g. and slightly blurred 
focus; the Easterner alone, in sharp focus; all are tightly 
looking into the Swede's eyes but the Easterner is the only 
one who looks at all "concerned" or in the least sympathetic.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE -- PAST EASTERNER, COWBOY AND 
JOHNNIE

He seems to feel he is "formidably menaced". He sends an 
appealing glance to the Easterner. Start very quietly, bring 
up ever louder, o.s. SOUND of "some loose thing beating 
regularly against the clapboards" -- "like a spirit tapping".

SWEDE
(mockingly, to 
Easterner)
They say they don't know what I mean!

EASTERNER
(impassively)
I don't understand you.

Johnnie and the Cowboy exchange glances and look to the Swede.

MEDIUM SHOT -- SWEDE -- PAST EASTERNER: COWBOY AND JOHNNIE 
FLANKING

SWEDE
(shrugging)
Oh, I see you are all against me. I 
see --

During the shrug, the CAMERA creeps a little to the r. past 
the Easterner and bores in on the Swede and the Cowboy, the 
latter in deep stupefaction and rising impatience. By the 
time of the second "I see", the CAMERA loses the Swede 
entirely and the Cowboy, in solitary CLOSE UP, slams down 
his hands on the board:

COWBOY
Say, what're you gett'n' at, hey?

WHIP CAMERA TO SWEDE AND TILT UP as he springs up with the 
celerity of a man escaping from a snake on the floor.

SWEDE
(standing in tilted 
close up from the 
angle of the center 
of the table)
I don't want to fight! I don't want 
to fight!

CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE (STANDING) -- LEVEL A LITTLE ABOVE THEIR 
HEADS

They have saved the table from his sudden getting up; their 
hands clench it. The Cowboy stretches his long legs insolently 
and deliberately. He jams his hands deep in his pockets. He 
spits, twisting past his shoulder, into the cuspidor almost 
at the Swede's feet.

COWBOY
(quiet and contemptuous)
Well, who in tarnation thought you 
did?

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE AND COWBOY

The Cowboy's turned head and jaw in floor of shot at the 
beginning; slowly CREEP ON THE SWEDE, gaining a little, losing 
the Cowboy, as the Swede backs rapidly toward the wall near 
the coat room, in his eyes, "the dying swan look". The TAPPING 
outdoors is VERY LOUD by now.

SWEDE
(voice quavering)
Gentlemen, I suppose I am going to 
be killed before I can leave this 
house! I suppose I am going to be 
killed before I can leave this house!

SOUND of door opening o.s.

MEDIUM SHOT -- SCULLY, FROM SAME POSITION, NEW ANGLE

He enters from his office near the front door. He pauses in 
surprise.

MEDIUM SHOT -- SWEDE -- GROUP IN B.G. -- FROM SCULLY'S ANGLE

SWEDE
(eagerly and swiftly; 
head turning to answer 
Scully)
These men are going to kill me.

SCULLY
Kill you! Kill you? What are you 
talkin'?

The Swede makes the "gesture of a martyr".

SCULLY
What is this, Johnnie?

JOHNNIE
(sullen, but looking 
at Scully)
I dunno. I can't make no sense to 
it.
(eyes drifting, he 
begins to shuffle 
the cards with an 
angry snap)
He says a good many men have been 
killed in this room, or something 
like like that. And he says he's 
goin' to be killed here too. I dunno 
what ails him. He's crazy, I shouldn't 
wonder.

SCULLY
Kill you? Kill you? Man, you're off 
your nut.

SWEDE
Oh, I know. I know what will happen. 
Yes, I'm crazy -- yes. But I know 
one thing...

GROUP -- FROM THE SWEDE'S ANGLE

An almost lightning quick shot of all of them from the Swede's 
angle.

CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE

SWEDE
...I know I won't get out of here 
alive.

HOLD on him, sweating and full of dread, at least three 
seconds of silence.

CLOSE UP -- COWBOY

He "draws a deep breath, as if his mind was passing into the 
last stages of dissolution".

COWBOY
(whispering almost to 
himself)
Well, I'm doggoned.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY

Wheeling suddenly on Johnnie.

SCULLY
You've been troublin' this man!

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- JOHNNIE -- PAST COWBOY, SCULLY IN L.S.

JOHNNIE
(loudly; with grievance)
Why good night, I ain't done nothin 
to 'im!

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE -- PAST EASTERNER AND COWBOY, AND 
PAST SCULLY, STANDING, JUST BEYOND COWBOY

SWEDE
(one step forward; 
stops)
Gentlemen, do not disturb yourselves. 
I will leave this house. I will go 
away, because --

He accuses them dramatically with his glance.

CLOSER SHOT -- SAME ANGLE

SWEDE
-- Because I do not want to be killed.

SCULLY
(wheeling, furious, 
to Johnnie)
Will ye tell me what's the matter ye 
young divil? What's the matter, 
annyhow? Speak out!

JOHNNIE
Blame it! I tell you I don't know. 
He -- he says we want to kill him, 
and that's all I know. I can't tell 
what ails him.

SWEDE
Never mind Mr. Scully; never mind. I 
will leave this house. I will go 
away because I do not want to be 
killed. Yes, of course, I am crazy -- 
yes. But I know one thing! I will go 
away. I will leave this house. Never 
mind, Mr. Scully; never mind. I will 
go away.

SCULLY
You will not go away. You will not 
go away until I hear the reason of 
this business. If anybody has troubled 
you I will take care of him. This is 
my house. You're under my roof, and 
I will not allow any peaceable man 
to be troubled here.

SWEDE
Never mind, Mr. Scully; never mind. 
I know you don't want trouble, but 
you can't stop them. Nobody can stop 
them, not God Himself.
(sad wag of head)
No Mr. Scully, I will go away. I do 
not wish to be killed. I'll get my 
baggage.

The screen is empty for a moment, then Scully darts into the 
shot, half across the screen.

SCULLY
(peremptorily)
No, no!

MEDIUM SHOT -- SAME POSITION

Angle for the Swede's "beyond words" backward glance at 
Scully, and his sad and deliberate exit.

Scully still transfixed in c.s., looking after the Swede; 
SOUND of a door closing and the Swede's slow feet on the 
stairs. He holds, slowly turns, walks slowly and very 
impressively back toward the table, CAMERA with him.

SCULLY
Now. What does this mane?

CLOSE SHOT -- THE THREE FROM SCULLY'S STOOPED, INVESTIGATORY 
ANGLE

JOHNNIE AND COWOY
(rather loudly and 
almost in unison)
Why, we didn't do nuthin' to him!

CLOSE SHOT -- UP AT SCULLY -- FROM EASTERNER'S ANGLE

So close that Johnnie and the Cowboy are not in the shot.

SCULLY
(coldly)
No? You didn't?

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHNNIE -- FROM EASTERNER'S ANGLE

JOHNNIE
Why this is the wildest loon I ever 
see. We didn't do nuthin' at all. We 
were jest sett'n' here playin' cards, 
and he...

SCULLY'S VOICE
(o.s., interrupting)
Mister --

CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY -- FROM EASTERNER'S ANGLE -- LOOKING 
STRAIGHT INTO LENS

SCULLY
(solemnly)
Mister: what has these boys been 
doin'?

CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER -- FROM SCULLY'S ANGLE

EASTERNER
(slowly, after a long, 
careful pause)
I didn't see anything wrong at all.

PULL BACK to frame in Johnnie and the Cowboy; vindicated and 
a little smug.

CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY

Miserably and desperately chewing that one over: a sudden 
outburst.

SCULLY
(howling)
But what does it mane?
(to Johnnie)
I've a good mind to lather ye for 
this, me boy!

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHNNIE -- FROM SCULLY'S ANGLE

JOHNNIE
(frantic)
Well what've I done?

CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY -- FROM JOHNNIE'S ANGLE

CLOSE SHOT -- COWBOY -- FROM SCULLY'S ANGLE

CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER -- FROM SCULLY'S ANGLE

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY -- PAST THE THREE

SCULLY
(scornfully)
I think you are tongue-tied.

He looks at them 1-2-3 again, turns on his heel; walks toward 
the stairway door and out of shot, CAMERA LIFTING a trifle 
to follow.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE THREE -- PAST SWEDE'S EMPTY CHAIR

Over SOUND of closing door and Scully's climbing feet, each 
looks from one to the other, speechless, dumbfounded.

QUICK FADE:

FADE IN:

CLOSE SHOT -- THE SWEDE'S ROOM (UPSTAIRS)

The Swede's leaning left shoulder; he is strapping his valise. 
A LITTLE NOISE; he straightens up wheeling with a loud cry, 
CAMERA following into CLOSE UP; his terrified eyes are fixed 
just to the right of the lens.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY AT THE OPEN DOOR

He is carrying a small kerosene lamp which scare-lights his 
wrinkled face. He should "resemble a murderer" sufficiently 
to startle even the audience.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE -- PAST SCULLY

Still sick with terror as Scully leaves the dark corridor 
and enters the lighted room.

SCULLY
Man! Man! Have you gone daffy?

CLOSE TWO SHOT -- SCULLY WALKING INTO SHOT

Carrying his lamp; ordinary lighting of room.

SWEDE
Oh, no! Oh, no!
(short pause)
There are people in this world who 
know pretty nearly as much as you do -- 
understand?

CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE -- FROM SCULLY'S VIEWPOINT

On his deathly pale cheeks are two spots, "as sharply edged 
as if they had been carefully painted". His eyes brighten 
almost as if with tears. For a moment his mouth trembles; 
then he makes it firm.

SWEDE
(quiet, solemn, 
profoundly sad)
Just one rule, Mr. Scully, and I 
learned it young. Don't never trust 
nobody. Be ready for anything.

He looks at Scully, both daring him to contradict, and 
desperately pleading for assurance that this is not so.

SWEDE
My father beat that into me. That's 
why I'm alive today.
(his pleading, 
forbidding look 
intensifies)

CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY FROM SWEDE'S VIEWPOINT

Scully means well but all this is far beyond him; besides, 
he is wholly wrapped up in the immediate situation. He is 
studying the Swede very carefully, in deep concern and 
puzzlement. After a moment he puts his lamp on the table and 
sits on the edge of the bed, CAMERA SWINGING to keep him 
centered.

MEDIUM SHOT -- SCULLY R.S. -- SWEDE STANDING L.S.

AS SCULLY SITS

SCULLY
(ruminatively)
By cracky, I never heard of such a 
thing in my life. It's a complete 
muddle. I can't for the soul of me 
think how you ever got this idea 
into your head.
(a short silence)
And did you sure think they were 
going to kill you?

SWEDE
(scans him as if he 
wants to see into 
his mind. At last, 
with a great effort)
I did.

He turns again to the valise straps, back to Scully. His 
whole arm shakes, his elbow wavering like a bit of paper.

SCULLY
(banging impressively 
on the footboard of 
the bed)
Why, man, we're goin' to have a line 
of illictric street-cars in this 
town next spring.

SWEDE
(stupidly, vacantly)
A line of electric street-cars.
(he gets busy on the 
other strap)

SCULLY
And there's a new railroad goin' to 
be built down from Broken Arm to 
here. Not to mention the four churches 
and the smashin' big brick 
schoolhouse. Then there's the big 
factory, too. Why in two years 
Rrhahmpr'll be a metropolis.

SWEDE
(he straightens up 
and politely awaits 
the termination of 
the foregoing lines)
Mr. Scully, how much do I owe you?

SCULLY
(sore; getting up)
You don't owe me one red cent.

SWEDE
Yes I do.
(he takes coins from 
his pocket and offers 
them to Scully, who 
snaps his fingers in 
disdainful refusal; 
their eyes rest on 
the open palm between 
them, gazing in a 
strange fashion)

INSERT:

The open palm, very heavy and alive, tailors' marks and 
callouses on it, trembling faintly; three quarters on it.

MEDIUM SHOT -- SCULLY R.S. -- SWEDE STANDING L.S.

Their eyes lift from the open palm and meet strangely in 
silence.

SCULLY
(quietly)
I'll not take your money. Not after 
what's been goin' on here.

All of a sudden he begins to look very crafty. The Swede 
watches the change in his face with deep uneasiness.

CLOSE UP -- THE SWEDE

His eyes to Scully, looking still more uneasy.

CLOSE UP -- SCULLY -- FROM SWEDE'S ANGLE

Looking still more crafty.

SCULLY
Here, here!
(he turns and picks 
up the lamp, CAMERA 
following, and comes 
back close again, 
beckoning, guileful)
Come with me a minute.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE -- PAST SCULLY

Recoiling in overwhelming alarm.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY -- FROM SWEDE'S ANGLE

Pressing closer; wheedling, crafty.

SCULLY
Yes! Come on! I want you to come and 
see a pitcher -- just across the 
hall -- in my room.

Swede very close, his teeth shaking like a dead man's; PULL 
BACK to bring in Scully very close in almost the posture of 
a Judas about to plant the kiss, eyes slantwise up to the 
taller man.

SCULLY
Come on. There's nuthin' to be afraid 
of: Come on.
(he starts for the 
door)

PULL CAMERA BACK and lead them out through the door, Scully 
holding his lamp high, the Swede following with the step of 
one hung in chains.

CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY'S BEDROOM

The lamp is thrust through darkness high upward against the 
wall of Scully's room, picking up first a sliding swatch of 
ornate wallpaper, then a ridiculous photograph of a little 
girl, the figure graceful as an upright sled-stake. She is 
the hue of lead. She leans against a balustrade or gorgeous 
decoration. The formidable bang to her hair is prominent.

SCULLY
There, that's the pitcher of my little 
girl that died. Her name was Carrie. 
She had the purtiest hair you ever 
saw.

PULL BACK to take Scully close, looking up.

SCULLY
(continuing)
I was that fond of her, she --

Scully's eyes to the Swede, SWING CAMERA onto the Swede, 
Scully beyond him. He is not looking either at Scully or the 
picture but is keeping keen watch on the gloom at the rear.

SCULLY
(continuing)
Look, man! That's the pitcher of my 
little girl that died. Her name was 
Carrie.
(Swede is around, 
reluctant, scared, 
uninterested. As his 
eyes lift toward the 
picture, SWING CAMERA 
to lose him, and 
past Scully, and to 
new picture as Scully 
continues)
And then here's the pitcher of my 
eldest boy, Michael...
(graduation shot, cap 
and gown, a smart, 
shrewd, ambitious-
looking young Irishman)
...he's a lawyer in Lincoln, an' 
doin' well. I gave that boy a grand 
eddication an' I'm glad for it now. 
He's a fine boy. Look at him now.

CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY AND SWEDE -- FROM PICTURE'S ANGLE

SCULLY
Ain't he bold as blazes, him there 
in Lincoln! An honored and respected 
gintleman.
(turning to the Swede)
An honored and respected gintleman.
(he smites the Swede 
jovially on the back; 
the Swede smiles 
faintly, lugubriously)
Now, there's only one thing more.
(he turns from the 
wall and the Swede 
turns his head back 
to CAMERA to look.)

MEDIUM SHOT -- SCULLY

He drops to knees, plants his lamp on the carpet, and burrows 
under the bed.

SCULLY'S VOICE
(muffled)
I'd keep it under me piller if it 
wasn't fer that boy Johnnie.

MEDIUM CLOSE -- SWEDE -- FROM JUST OFF ANGLE OF LAMP

SCULLY'S VOICE
(o.s.)
Then there's the old woman -- Where 
is it now?

CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY'S HIGH RUMP AND THE LAMP

SCULLY'S VOICE
(from under bed)
I never put it twice in the same 
place. Ah, now, come out with ye.

Scrambling and grunting he backs from under the bed dragging 
an old coat rolled into a bundle, flecked with lint.

SCULLY
I've fetched him!

He starts brushing off flecks of lint.

MEDIUM CLOSE -- SWEDE -- FROM JUST OFF ANGLE OF LAMP

The Swede, his eye sharpening.

Scully brushes off a last little whisk of lint and carefully 
unrolls the coat, and extracts from its heart a large yellow-
brown whiskey bottle. He holds the bottle against the 
lamplight. Reassured that nobody has been at it, he thrusts 
it upward with a generous movement toward the Swede.

MEDIUM SHOT -- SWEDE -- PAST SCULLY

He is about to eagerly clutch this element of strength but 
suddenly jerks his hand away and casts a look of horror upon 
Scully.

Scully gets to his feet, lamp in one hand, bottle in the 
other, and takes a step toward the Swede.

SCULLY
(affectionately)
Drink.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY AND SWEDE

Lighted only by the lamp. A silence. Scully clamps the bottle 
under the lamp-bearing arm, twists out the cork, holds out 
both bottle and cork.

SCULLY
Drink!

Suddenly the Swede laughs wildly. He grabs the bottle, screws 
it into his mouth.

CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY -- PAST SWEDE

Small, worried, the beginning even of a look of fright.

CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE

In witch-like lamplight: bottle tilted high, lips curling 
around the opening, throat working and SOUNDS of his 
swallowing: his eyes, burning with hatred, fixed upon Scully.

DISSOLVE TO:

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- COWBOY, EASTERNER, JOHNNIE -- PAST 
SWEDE'S EMPTY CHAIR

A long astounded silence. The Easterner lights a cigarette.

JOHNNIE
(almost reverently)
That's the dod-dangdest Swede I ever 
see!

COWBOY
(contemptuously)
He ain't no Swede.

JOHNNIE
Well what is he then? What is he 
then?

COWBOY
(astutely and 
deliberately)
It's my opinion he's some kind of a 
Dutchman.

Johnnie is impressed; the Easterner, interested and amused 
by both of them, covers his amusement.

COWBOY
(continuing)
Yes, sir, it's my opinion this feller 
is some kind of a Dutchman.

JOHNNIE
(sulkily)
Well he says he's a Swede anyhow.
(to Easterner)
What do you think?

EASTERNER
Oh, I don't know.

COWBOY
Well, what do you think makes him 
act like that?

EASTERNER
Why, he's frightened.
(he flicks ash in 
spittoon)

CAMERA slowly creeps them into close up.

EASTERNER
(continuing)
He's clear frightened out of his 
boots.

JOHNNIE AND COWBOY
(in unison)
What at?

The Easterner reflects.

JOHNNIE AND COWBOY
(again in unison)
What at?

EASTERNER
(slowly turning the 
cigarette between 
his fingertips, 
scrutinising the 
coal)
Oh, I don't know, but it seems to me 
this man has been reading dime novels 
about the wild west, and he thinks 
he's right out in the middle of it -- 
the shootin' and stabbin' and all.
(he looks to the Cowboy 
and then to Johnnie)

CLOSER SHOT -- COWBOY -- FROM ANGLE OF JOHNNIE'S RIGHT 
SHOULDER, EASTERNER'S BACK, IN L.S.

COWBOY
(deeply scandalized)
But this ain't Wyoming, ner none o' 
them places. This is Nebrasky.

CLOSER SHOT -- JOHNNIE -- FROM ANGLE OF COWBOY'S LEFT 
SHOULDER, EASTERNER'S BACK, IN R.S.

JOHNNIE
(sore and eager)
Yeah, an' why don't he wait till he 
gits out West?

CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER -- FROM ANGLE OF SWEDE'S CHAIR

EASTERNER
(laughs quietly)
It isn't so wild out there even -- 
not in these days. But he thinks 
he's right in the middle of hell.

He is quiet. Johnnie and the Cowboy muse long.

JOHNNIE
(after a silence)
It's awful funny.

COWBOY
Yeah, this is a queer game. I hope 
we don't git snowed in...
(Easterner glances 
toward front window)
...'cause then we'd have to stand 
this here man around with us all the 
time. That wouldn't be no good.
(he wags his head)
No sir ree bob tail.

JOHNNIE
I wish Pop ud throw him out.

COWBOY
Couldn't do that. He ain't done 
nuthin'. Not edsackly.

JOHNNIE
I don't care. I don't like him.

COWBOY
You or me neither.

They are alerted by SOUND of loud stomping on the stairs, 
o.s. Scully's ringing voice ad lib, no words audible; the 
Swede's laughter. They all look quickly to the stairway door, 
then "vacantly" at each other.

COWBOY
Gosh!

SOUND of door opening o.s.; all look sharply toward it.

LONG SHOT -- SAME POSITION -- UP ROOM TO DOOR

Scully, flushed and anecdotal, swings into the room and down 
toward the table like all three musketeers. The Swede follows, 
laughing bravely.

SCULLY
(more or less over 
his shoulder)
An' then he sez, sez, 'Oh', he sez, 
'I've got to bring thim along to 
hould the jackass,' he sez: 'He don't 
like it.'
(plenty of haw haw 
from Swede and Scully)
'He don't like it', he sez! Wouldn't 
that kill yez?

SWEDE
He don't like it, huh? Haw, haw,! 
Durn good!

Scully is almost up to the stove, Swede close behind; CAMERA 
PULLS BACK to shoot past them at the seated men during 
Scully's next line.

SCULLY
(sharply)
Come now, move up and give us a chance 
at the stove.

The Cowboy and the Easterner obediently sidle their chairs 
to make room. Johnnie, keeping the board on his lap, simply 
arranges himself in a more indolent attitude.

SCULLY
Come, git over there.

JOHNNIE
Plenty of room without me movin'.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY -- FROM JOHNNIE'S ANGLE SWEDE IN 
BACKGROUND

SCULLY
(roaring)
An' you with the warmest spot in the 
house?

SWEDE
(a patronising bully)
No, no. Let the boy sit where he 
likes.

SCULLY
(deferentially)
All right! All right!

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- COWBOY AND EASTERNER

They exchange glances of wonder.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ACROSS GROUP BETWEEN EASTERNER AND 
JOHNNIE

SWEDE
Anyhow, I don't know as I want to 
sit with these people.

SCULLY
Just suit yourself Mister. We'd be 
glad of yer company, but just suit 
yourself. Liberty Hall, ye know.
(he laughs nervously)

SWEDE
I want a drink of water.

SCULLY
(at once)
I'll git it for you.

SWEDE
(contemptuously)
Nahh, I'll get it for myself.

He walks off with the air of an owner toward and into Scully's 
office. CAMERA LIFTING TO FOLLOW, shooting past tops of the 
heads of the seated men. As soon as he is out of sight Scully 
and CAMERA lean down quick and close into the group.

SCULLY
(in an intense whisper)
Ye know what? Upstairs? I gave him a 
little snort o' what's good for yez, 
an' he thought I was tryin' to poison 
'im!

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ON JOHNNIE AND SCULLY -- PAST THE 
EASTERNER AND COWBOY

JOHNNIE
(not lowering his 
voice)
Say, this makes me sick, why...

SCULLY
(finger to lips)
Ssh!

JOHNNIE
(voice scarcely lowered)
...why don't you throw 'im out in 
the snow?

SCULLY
Why, he's all right now. It was only 
that he was from the East, and he 
thought this was a tough place...

CLOSE SHOT -- COWBOY

Looking with admiration toward the Easterner

SCULLY'S VOICE
(o.s.)
...That's all. He's all right now.

As the Cowboy speaks, the CAMERA SWINGS to include the 
Easterner.

COWBOY
You were straight. You were onto 
that there Dutchman, dead to rights.

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHNNIE -- FROM COWBOY'S ANGLE

JOHNNIE
Well, he may be all right now, but I 
don't see it. Other time he was 
scared, but now he's too fresh. Ain't 
that right?

COWBOY'S VOICE
(o.s.)
Sure looks like it to me.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- COWBOY AND EASTERNER -- PAST JOHNNIE

COWBOY
Looks like to me he's bound to fall 
off one side a th' hoss or t'other.

The Easterner nods quietly.

JOHNNIE'S VOICE
(o.s.)
Why don't you kick him out, Pop?

A sharp INTAKE OF BREATH from Scully; all look up sharply.

CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY

PULLING BACK with him as he leans down into group, hands on 
knees, thundering at him with passionate solemnity.

SCULLY
What do I keep? What do I keep? What 
do I keep?
(he slaps one knee 
impressively; shouts)
I keep a hotel! A hotel, do ye mind? 
A guest under my roof has sacred 
privileges. He is to be intimidated 
by none. Not one word shall he hear 
that would prijiduce him in favor of 
goin' away. I'll not have it. There's 
no place in this here town where 
they can say they iver took in a 
guest of mine because he was afraid 
to stay here.
(he wheels intensely 
on the Cowboy and 
the Easterner -- to 
the Cowboy)
Am I right?

COWBOY
(solemnly)
Yes, Mr. Scully, I think you're right.

SCULLY
(to Easterner)
Am I right?

EASTERNER
(solemnly)
Yes, Mr. Scully, I think you're right.

CAMERA tilts upward a little, shooting across the group, 
still HOLDING them in the bottom of the shot; after a second 
the Swede re-enters from the office and walks toward them, 
his footsteps heavy, his eyes on them. None of them look up 
or around at him.

The SOUND of an opening door, o.s.; Scully's eyes toward it.

MEDIUM SHOT -- SAME POSITION BUT NEW ANGLE -- DINING ROOM 
DOOR

Past the stove on the dining room door; Scully's daughter is 
leaning through it.

DAUGHTER
(low, inhibited voice)
Papa: supper.

CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY

SCULLY
(almost under his 
breath)
Supper, gintlemen.
(he gestures them up)

They are all up and filing toward the door; still no eye for 
the Swede who is walking alone toward them.

QUICK FADE:

FADE IN:

CLOSE SHOT -- DINING ROOM -- THE SWEDE

His head is against an almost halation-brassy highlight, 
through glass, on a broad perforated mechanical-music disc 
and, when we PULL BACK, a mechanical violin or mandolin: 
stentorian NOISE of the nervous plucking of the perforations 
and the exact driven rasping screech of the violin (playing 
some potpourri of Waldteufel waltzes or of early honky-tonk 
ragtime): also a NOISE of cranking and of tightening springs. 
The Swede's stooped round shining malignantly grinning face 
is on level of disc and much like it. His napkin on, his 
hair wetted and combed slick but beginning to spike up awry; 
he laughs low, finishes his cranking and listens a moment 
with burlesque of connoisseur's or Old Maestro's relish, 
imitates a would-be-lyrical phrase of the violin with the 
skreeky humming of a bass humming falsetto and with mock-
affected hands mocking those of a violinist and with a look 
of mock ecstasy; then smacks his hands together loudly and 
does a peasant dance step on his way back to his chair, which 
is almost directly in front of the machine so that the turning 
disc backs Swede's head throughout this scene like a phony 
halo. He scrapes back his chair as loudly as he can; sits 
down, and looks triumphantly and cruelly and with an air of 
great benefaction from man to man, while he shovels down the 
food in the manner of Henry VIII.

QUICK FLICKING SHOTS, AS FROM THE SWEDE'S EYES: SEATING SAME 
AS AT DINNER

THE EASTERNER

Looking even smaller than he is, eating rather little; encased 
in reserve.

THE COWBOY

Staring across at the Swede in wide-mouthed amazement, 
forgetting to eat.

SCULLY

His own version of the Easterner, shoulders huddled, eyes to 
plate, trying to pretend to eat as if nothing were happening.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE AND JOHNNIE -- PAST EASTERNER AND 
COWBOY

The Swede is leering happily sidelong at Johnnie, who is 
eating quickly and savagely. PULL AROUND to lose Johnnie and 
CREEP INTO FULL CLOSE UP on the Swede, losing the Cowboy and 
the Easterner.

The Swede munches and finishes a huge mouthful, drinks from 
his tumbler with parodistic extension of thick pinkie, swabs 
his mouth royally with the apron of the napkin which is tied 
under his ears; flicks glances from eye to eye.

SWEDE
(with brutally mock 
incredulity)
You gentlemen don't like a little 
dinner music?

FLICK SHOT OF EASTERNER AND COWBOY FROM SWEDE'S ANGLE

They are even more-so what they were, than before.

FLICK ON SCULLY -- FROM SWEDE'S ANGLE

He primly and delicately sips from his glass, looking a little 
like a hurt old lady.

CLOSE ON SWEDE

SWEDE
Or maybe it ain't the custom in your 
country?
(leans toward Scully)

CAMERA SWINGS to bring in Scully

SWEDE
(continuing)
Ain't it the custom Mr. Scully? Am I 
making a foe pah, like the feller 
says?

SCULLY
(not looking up; 
mumbling)
O, yes, yes. It's a custom. Music or 
not, it's all the same.

SWEDE
(to table at large, 
talking with mouth 
full most of the 
time, CAMERA PULLS 
BACK to center him, 
Scully flanking on 
r., Johnnie and 
Cowboy's shoulder on 
l.)
Now on the other side, go to a high 
class restaurant, beer garden, why 
they wouldn't call it a nice place 
to eat without they have a feller 
with a fiddle, pianner, couple a 
palm trees on a little platform, 
they play you sweet music while you 
eat.
(bite; gobble)
New York City it's the same. Calms 
you down. Cheers you up. Settles yer 
stummick good.
(drink; bite)
But here,
(chew)
seems like you gentlemen don't enjoy 
it.
(bite)
Maybe you just don't like music. 
Hehnh?
(he giggles low as he 
looks around)

FLICK SHOT -- EASTERNER -- FROM SWEDE'S ANGLE FLICK SHOT -- 
COWBOY CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE

SWEDE
(Takes another big 
bite)
'Course in a low-class joint -- a 
domp...
(Scully winces)
...you can't expect no musicians, 
nor no appreciation, neither. Bunch 
of ignorant louts is all. Ain't that 
right, Mr. Scully?

Scully half nods, not speaking or looking; trying to pretend 
to eat.

SWEDE
(continuing)
Yah, just a bonch a louts.
(flicks his eyes around)
Tough guys.
(flicks eyes and 
giggles)
But this ain't no domp!
(giggles)
Oh no.
(giggles harder)
And you ain't no tough guys.
(flicks and giggles 
harder)
Ooohh no!
(laughs outright)
Are ye Johnnieboy?
(he side-swipes Johnnie 
with his eating elbow; 
Johnnie swipes back 
hard; Swede roars 
with laughter.)
Oh, I beg yer pardon Johnnieboy! I 
got to mind my manners I can see 
that!

INSERT

Vertical over biscuit plate as the Easterner's small, reaching 
hand is all but impaled by the Swede's fork, reaching for a 
biscuit.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER -- QUICK SHOT FROM SWEDE'S 
ANGLE Easterner's reaction, which is to cover up as quick as 
possible.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE

He glints expectantly toward the Easterner, bursts into loud 
laughter at his reaction, which he translates as cowardice.

Up through the SOUND of his hard loud laughter and the hard 
loud music, comes an enigmatic racket; the chuffing, growling 
roar, the banshee wail of wind in the chimney. The Swede's 
laugh bites off like a hatchet through a hen's neck: he is 
transfixed by the profound fright which unexpected noises 
cause in some men.

SWEDE
(to Scully)
What's that?

No answer. The ROAR continues. The Swede's fear increases.

MEDIUM SHOT -- DOWN THE TABLE PAST SCULLY

Three grateful, happy faces, nobody eating, eyes all lifted 
to study Swede.

CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE -- SCULLY IN AT R.S.

SWEDE
What's that I said!

CAMERA PULLS BACK a little, equalizing the Swede and Scully

SCULLY
(with sardonic relish)
Nuthin' to be scared of Mister. Just 
the wind. Just the angle of the wind 
in the chimney.

They all resume eating; little glances to the Swede and each 
other; plenty pleased.

CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE

He listens a moment; the SOUND begins slowly to diminish.

SWEDE
(coldly, heavily)
Who's scared?
(he looks around; 
silence)
Who says so?
(looks around again)

CAMERA begins to PULL BACK on his bullying glance to their 
silence.

SWEDE
(continuing; low hard 
giggle begins)
Me scared?
(giggle)
Me?

CAMERA arrests pull-out; Swede is centered, Scully and Johnnie 
and the Cowboy's shoulder flanking. The giggle breaks into 
full malicious laughter.

SWEDE
(continuing; finally; 
to Johnnie)
Butter please.

Johnnie acts as if he didn't even hear.

SWEDE
(continuing; reaching 
across Johnnie for 
the butter just short 
of brutally enough 
to require action)
Thankk you, son.
(he takes a huge hunk 
of butter, while 
Scully winces, and 
loads it onto a split 
biscuit. In a 
friendly, chatty 
manner, to Scully)
That's what I like about the hotel 
you keep Mister Scully.
(chomp, chomp)
It ain't got no class but they ain't 
nobody can say you're stingy with 
the vittles: hah?

On "hah?", a mouthful of buttery biscuit wide open in mock-
friendliness; some of it falls out almost on Scully's plate. 
Swede, in mock embarassment, picks it up as prissily as if 
it stank and puts it on the edge of his own plate.

Scully's daughter enters to clear plates.

SWEDE
O parrdon mee. Marrdon me paddum 
this pie is occypewed, allow me to 
sew you to another sheet, a-har-har-
har-har-har, that's a hot one, huh? 
How do you like that! This pie is 
occypewed. Huh? Oh marrdon me paddum.
(the daughter, behind 
him, is trying to 
get past his elbow: 
he makes her have to 
lean against him)
Miss I ought to say. Mardon me...
(he begins to finish 
the spoonerism with 
silent lips, is taken 
by mock surprise, 
mock shock, amusement 
and delight; Scully 
glances up at him 
very sharply; to 
Scully, pleasantly)
She ain't married is she Mister 
Scully?
(silence; even more 
honeyed)
How old is your daughter, Mister 
Scully?
(no answer. -- Daughter 
by now has collected 
Scully's plate and 
vanished down the 
line of Cowboy and 
Easterner, out of 
shot)
Mardon me sir I mean sardon me mur; 
that ain't a question a gentleman 
would ask, is it? Is it Mister Scully?
(silence)
But it's a fair bet she's older than 
Johnnieboy, huh Johnnie? Could pretty 
near be Johnnie's mother, huh?

She is coming behind him with dessert and now tries to serve 
him; again he forces her to lean, twisting and looking up at 
her with broad mock-admiration; at the moment her face leans 
lowest he winks into her face enormously and clicks his gums; 
she shrivels, shoveling his saucer onto the table, and hurries 
away. Scully is damn near ready to take action but the Swede 
breaks through a comfortable giggle in a voice of deep and 
kind concern, genuine-seeming enough to counter Scully.

SWEDE
Poor girl. I must of said something 
that hurt her feelings. You tell her 
how sorry I am Mister Scully if I 
don't get a chance to tell her myself, 
will you?
(no answer)
Please sir. They ain't nothing a 
gentleman feels so ashamed of as if 
he hurts a lady's feelings. Yes, I 
tell you, Mister Scully, you're a 
mighty lucky man, you got a fine 
girl will stay with you she likes 
her old Dad so much, when plenty 
would just get married and clear 
outa this town quick as they got the 
chance. Cuts down the overhead, you 
don't have to hire no help. Maybe 
she gives you her tips, hah? Besides, 
you run a hotel that ain't so much 
fer class, it makes up fer a lot if 
you see a pretty girl around the 
place. Hah? Little services she can 
do the guests, don't ya know, that 
need the woman's touch? Yes, sir, my 
opinion is, you're a mighty lucky 
man.
(but instead of quite 
getting out "man" 
clearly, he nurses 
and relishes along 
and delivers a slow 
tremendous growling 
belch)
Now where I come from, a feller that 
done that, they'd say it was somethin' 
so awful it ain't any use to make 
excuses. They'd just say, go on out 
an' eat with the pigs. That's in 
Europe. But heere: In Americah: Course 
in China they tell me, why if you 
don't give a nice big belch why your 
host his feelings get hurt cause you 
ain't got no manners. You give a 
belch to prove you like the eats. 
Like that. See? But then you ain't 
no Chinaman, are you Mister Scully.
(the low steady giggle 
and the look around)
No sir, it takes all kinds.

He looks around for something else to say; picking his teeth 
and talking through it.

SWEDE
Funny thing, you fellers don't eat 
enough. Look hearty, except a course 
our little friend from Philadelphia, 
but you don't eat enough. Except 
Johnnieboy here. He'll eat you outa 
house and home, hah Johnnie? But 
Johnnie needs it. Gonna make a man 
of him someday hah Johnnieboy?
(giggle)
If he can eat enough.
(giggle)
Now me: one thing I can say for 
myself, ain't nothing ever hurts my 
appetite. I betcha I could eat hearty 
off my dead mother's coffin.
(the look around)
Take tonight. Nobody talking hardly 
but me. Nobody but me trying to be 
sociable and keep the ball rolling. 
Lotsa people that'd put um off their 
feed like it done you fellers, but 
not me. Like you see it in the papers, 
the condemned man ate a hearty 
breakfast. Supper I mean.
(pleasant laugh)
All it takes now to make it perfect 
is another little glass of schnapps, 
uhh? Settle our chow? Put the stummick 
juices to work? Hehnh?

CAMERA PULLS BACK to bring Scully into TWO SHOT

SCULLY
(almost inaudible 
muttering)
No... think not... moderation... 
save it for medicinal purposes...

SWEDE
(archly)
Oohh, Miss-ter Scully!

Scully pulls back his chair and gets up, CAMERA PULLING BACK 
to include whole group and table as all pull back and rise 
with relief. The Swede gets up too; as Scully passes he gives 
him a hell of a whack across the shoulders and steps along 
with him.

SWEDE
Well, anyhow old boy, that was a 
good square meal.

CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY

It looks for a moment as though he might flame out over the 
matter.

MEDIUM CLOSE -- THE GROUP -- PAST SCULLY

On their hopeful, expectant eyes.

Scully breaks down into a sickly smile and remains silent. 
It is clear from his manner that he is admitting his 
responsibility for the Swede's new viewpoint.

The Swede towers past Scully and past CAMERA toward the door; 
Scully follows, CAMERA SWINGING with him. As he passes 
Johnnie, Johnnie plucks at his sleeve and whispers something 
to him.

SCULLY
(in undertone)
Why don't you license somebody to 
kick you downstairs?

They go along toward and through the door, CAMERA following. 
CAMERA PICKS UP the Easterner and the Cowboy as they come 
along the end of the table toward the door.

EASTERNER
(low)
I thing that Swede had something.

COWBOY
Anything he's got he can keep.

EASTERNER
When he thought Scully was trying to 
poison him.

COWBOY
Mister!

They go through the door into the main room.

MEDIUM SHOT -- MAIN ROOM

CAMERA on dining room door, already swinging, catching them 
as they file in, stiff and silent with antagonism; swing 
with them as they pass on the far side of the stove to the 
crescent of empty chairs; the Swede strides immediately to 
the best chair, (nearest CAMERA) hand proprietorily on its 
back; not yet sitting; he wheels on the others as they 
straggle into the shot. They are all very tense and still 
with lounging hostility, intensely silent except when 
speaking. The Swede just keeps looking at them until they 
are all there, all still standing; as if he were a Chairman, 
waiting for members of a meeting to assemble.

SWEDE
(domineering)
Alll right: where's them cards?

SCULLY
(gently)
Oh, I don't think that's such a very 
good idea perhaps...

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE SWEDE -- FROM SCULLY'S ANGLE

SWEDE
(with a wolfish glare)
Oh you don't huh?

MEDIUM SHOT -- THE GROUP -- STOVE AT CENTER

SCULLY
(subsiding; meekly)
Well, of course it isn't for me to 
decide...

SWEDE
(threateningly; to 
the Easterner)
How about you?

CLOSE SHOT -- THE EASTERNER

EASTERNER
(tightly)
It suits me if you gentlemen want to 
play.

CLOSE SHOT -- THE SWEDE

SWEDE
(to Cowboy)
Got any objections?

CLOSE SHOT -- THE COWBOY

COWBOY
(hard and taciturn)
Suits me Mister.

SWEDE
Looks like you're out voted Mister 
Scully so where's them cards?

SCULLY
(still trying to be 
pleasant)
Well now that's friendly of you but 
if you gentlemen don't mind I think 
I'll just look at me paper; here it 
is night already and all day I 
haven't...

SWEDE
(interrupting; to 
Johnnie)
So?

For a moment their glances cross like blades. Then Johnnie 
smiles.

JOHNNIE
Yes; I'll play.

CAMERA PULLS BACK to include the whole group as he starts 
for the table. The Swede nods curtly. The Easterner and the 
Cowboy swap quiet glances. Scully looks uneasy enough almost 
to intervene; then purses his lips, shrugs faintly, and drifts 
out of the group and across shot nearer.

CAMERA SWINGS AND HOLDS on him, back-to, turning up the lamp 
on the side table for reading.

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHNNIE'S HANDS

The purring shuffle, swiftly, twice, PULLING OUT AND UP on 
second shuffle to take Johnnie, back to stove as before, and 
Swede at his left -- i.e. in r.s.

CLOSE UP -- COWBOY -- SCULLY IN DEEP B.G. AT WINDOW

SCULLY
(turning from window)
It's quit snowin' gintlemen.

COWBOY
Yeah?

SCULLY
(back toward reading 
table)
But a worse wind than ever. Bitter 
night.
(No comment from anyone)

CLOSE UP -- EASTERNER

Arranging his cards. He is absorbed in the tensions rather 
than the game.

CLOSE UP -- JOHNNIE

He is the only one of them well inside the cards. We see 
also his extreme hatred for the Swede, quietly and rather 
gracefully borne.

JOHNNIE
(to Swede, after a 
silence)
Well, it's your bid.

CLOSE UP -- THE SWEDE

His eyes, in a jagged flickering, down to the cards close to 
his chest, then toward each face in turn.

SWEDE
Don't hurry me, boy.
(a pause)

He bids rather high: in this game trumps are named only after 
bidding is finished.

HOLD CAMERA on the Swede as the Cowboy raises, Easterner 
passes and Johnnie passes.

SWEDE
(to Easterner)
Couldn't help me out, Huh?

No answer.

SWEDE
I pass.

He throws out his discards and picks up his new cards; looks 
to the Cowboy, expecting, as we do, the usual WHAM.

Move CAMERA into the CIRCULAR SHOT; on the Cowboy as he lays 
down his card, quite gently for him; on the Easterner's mildly 
surprised reaction as he plays; on Johnnie playing, his face 
very quiet and hating; on the Swede as, vindictively, with 
scarcely any amusement about it, he WHAMS harder than the 
Cowboy did all afternoon. His hand moves to rake in the trick.

COWBOY'S VOICE
(o.s.)
That's my trick.

SWEDE
(a dead voice)
So? I played the ace.

COWBOY'S VOICE
(o.s.)
That ain't the trump suit.

SWEDE
(his hand still on 
the trick)
So?

JOHNNIE'S VOICE
(o.s.)
Yeah, so.

SWEDE
It's yours.
(he shrugs and tosses 
trick to center of 
table)

CAMERA turns on them again, a little more quickly as each 
plays, picking up their smoldering reactions to the Swede's 
perversity; on the Swede's play he WHAMS again, even harder 
than before. Again he starts to rake in the trick.

EASTERNER'S VOICE
(o.s.)
That's Johnnie's trick.

SWEDE
So? What's trumps?

COWBOY'S VOICE
(o.s.)
Clubs, and besides you didn't only 
play a trey.

SWEDE
My left Pedro.

COWBOY
Five o' spades yer left Pedro.

SWEDE
Oh, five; oh yaah. Five.
(shrugs)
Okay; it's yours.
(he tosses the trick 
toward Johnnie)
It's only in fun.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE THREE FROM SWEDE'S ANGLE

Just looking at him.

SWEDE'S VOICE
(o.s.)
Your play.

Cowboy wonders for a moment whether to go on; then he plays 
a card quietly.

CLOSE SHOT -- THE SWEDE

Watchful and somber. SOUND of Easterner's and Johnnie's 
playing.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY

In his chair, flinching at the SOUND of the Swede's WHAM 
o.s. Continue card sounds and low voices ad lib o.s. as Scully 
loads his pipe; lights it; unfurls and arranges his newspaper 
for reading as the CAMERA creeps very slowly toward him into 
CLOSE UP; starts reading. Card SOUNDS fade and wind SOUND is 
brought up a little. Easterner's voice comes as vague as if 
through ether.

EASTERNER'S VOICE
(o.s.)
If you'd held onto that Jack we could 
have busted them you know.

SWEDE'S VOICE
(o.s.)
Just play your own hand Mister. I'll 
take care of mine.

SOUND of shuffling o.s., then of dealing; the card SOUNDS 
FADE OUT completely and the wind fades to a dreaming whine 
as we slowly FADE on Scully, deeply absorbed in his reading, 
his lips moving a little.

FADE IN:

Just a little soft in focus, faint card SOUNDS, the wind up 
a little; Scully is dozing; a wind-whicker wakes him with a 
jerk with which we jerk to pure focus. He glances up at the 
clock on the wall to his left; it is eight-twenty-seven and 
for those who noticed it before the fade, was then seven-
fourteen: Scully registers an aging man's surprise and mild 
embarrassment at old-age dozing. He clearly reproves himself 
and determines to wake up thoroughly and stay awake till a 
fit hour. He brushes spilled ash and tobacco crumbs from his 
lapel, polishes his glasses, readjusts them on his nose, 
resets himself to read; realizes the lamp is smoking a little; 
gets up fussily and adjusts it properly; business with paper 
again and really settles down to read, with that peering 
look of an old priest; lips moving, half-whispering what he 
is reading; a great rumpling turn of the paper, resettles 
again, peacefully reading fillers and mumbling to himself.

CAMERA CLOSE

SCULLY
(a whispering mumble)
"Lake Titicaca in Peru is the highest 
body of fresh water in the world, 
altitude a thousand feet. It's depths 
have never yet been plumbed." Niver 
yet been plumbed. Fascinatin'. Now 
isn't that fascinatin'!
(he peers)
"Some of the Giant Redwoods in 
California were sturdy saplings in 
the days of King Solomon (Circa 700 
B.C.)". Think o' that!
(he clucks his tongue)
Sturdy saplings were they! My!
(he peers)
"The longest railroad tunnel on the 
North American Continent is --

SWEDE
(o.s.; in a terrible 
voice)
You are cheatin'!

Catch just the beginning of Scully's reaction then

QUICK CUT TO:

LONG SHOT

The CAMERA is well toward the front of the room, height of 
the eyes of the seated men; Scully MEDIUM in r.s., players 
LONG, down center-to-left.

Scully is half out of his chair at the start of the shot; he 
stands up fast, his paper floating, forgotten, to his feet, 
making the only SOUND in the room. His spectacles fall from 
his nose as he gets up but, by a clutch, he saves them in 
mid-air; the hand grasping them is poised awkwardly near his 
shoulder. From the moment he is on his feet, a solid two 
seconds of frozen tableau: the Swede half crouching out of 
his chair, a huge fist, (not shaking) in Johnnie's face; 
Johnnie still seated, looking steadily into the blazing orbs 
of his accuser. The Easterner, gripping the arms of his chair, 
sits very still and is very pale.

After this 2-second paralysis, everybody moves as suddenly 
and simultaneously as if set off by a starter's gun. Johnnie, 
rising to hurl himself on the Swede, stumbles slightly because 
of his curiously instinctive care for the cards and table. 
The loss of this moment allows time for the arrival of Scully 
(an old man sprinting) and also allows Cowboy time to give 
the Swede a shove which sends him staggering back. They all 
find tongue together (ad lib variants and fragments of lines 
below) and hoarse shouts of rage, appeal or fear, burst from 
every throat. The Cowboy pushes and jostles feverishly at 
Swede; Easterner and Scully cling wildly to Johnnie; but 
through the smoky air, above the swaying bodies of the peace-
compellers, the eyes of the two warriors meet each other in 
glances of challenge which are at once hot and steely.

At the same instant everybody moves, the CAMERA ZOOMS TO 
CLOSE UP at average shoulder height, arriving just in time 
to catch them standing up and straining.

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHNNIE

Struggling against restraint INTO CLOSE UP

JOHNNIE
He says I cheated! He says --

CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE

SWEDE
(shrilly)
I saw him! He did! I saw him! I saw --

CLOSE UP -- SCULLY

CLINGING TO JOHNNIE

SCULLY
Stop now! Stop I say! Stop now --

CLOSE UP -- COWBOY

HOLDING BACK THE SWEDE

COWBOY
Quit now! Quit! D'ya hear --

CLOSE UP -- EASTERNER

CLINGING TO JOHNNIE

EASTERNER
(to all; unheeded)
Wait a moment can't you? Oh, wait a 
moment!

CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE AND COWBOY

Voices are simultaneous.

EASTERNER
(o.s.)
What's the good of a fight --

COWBOY
Quit it! Quit now! Qui --

SWEDE
He did! He did!

CLOSE THREE SHOT -- EASTERNER, SCULLY, JOHNNIE

Voices are again simultaneous.

EASTERNER
...over a game of cards? Wait a 
moment!

SCULLY
Stop it now! Stop it I say! St --

JOHNNIE
He says I cheated! He --

In a lower tone, o.s., the Cowboy and Swede repeat their 
lines.

CENTER CAMERA ON JOHNNIE and advance slowly on him into CLOSE 
UP SHOT as he continues

JOHNNIE
(continuing)
...he says I cheated! I won't allow 
no man to say I cheated! If he says 
I cheated he's a...

His lips form whatever most extreme suggestion of obscene or 
profane insult can be permitted by inference, covered and 
silenced by the Swede's still louder bellowing.

SWEDE
(o.s.)
He did cheat! I saw him!

CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE -- FULL FACE

SWEDE
I saw him! He did! He did!

CAMERA, starting with a shot past the Swede's head, centering 
on Johnnie MEDIUM CLOSE, makes, fairly fast and accelerating, 
steadily tighter and faster and closer, the circling movement 
by which a tethered heifer winds herself up short around a 
post. The players meanwhile are all simultaneously repeating 
their lines as heretofore with only very close ad lib 
variations: out of the din of their voices only key words 
ring out sharply. The weave of salients is roughly:

Stop n...

Wait a mom...

Quit now...

He says...

He did!...

What's the good...

Fight...

As the CAMERA thus ropes them in they all close tighter and 
tighter against one center as if it were literally a rope 
around them: they come as close as five people can get. The 
ROUNDING CAMERA, at shoulder height, SWINGS through an extreme 
CLOSE UP of the Swede past Johnnie's head and then of Johnnie 
past the Swede's head practically as if they were waltzing, 
and comes to a stop, very close in, profiling Johnnie's 
glaring head at l.s and the Swede's in r.s. Now there are no 
words; only the SOUND of excited breathing, then not even 
that: a sudden great cessation. It is as if each man has 
paused for breath.

CAMERA PULLS BACK INTO MEDIUM CLOSE -- THE WHOLE GROUP as 
hands relax and there is a cautious unstiffening away from 
center; even the Swede and Johnnie step back a little way. 
Then Johnnie steps forward, fairly close in to the Swede and 
the CAMERA moves in about a foot.

JOHNNIE
(less loudly)
What did you say I cheated for? What 
did you say I cheated for? I don't 
cheat and I won't let no man say I 
do.

SWEDE
I saw you! I saw you!

CAMERA CREEPS very slowly in: Its motion is that of a very 
slowly winding snake. CAMERA CENTERS ON JOHNNIE

JOHNNIE
Well, I'll fight any man what says I 
cheat!

CAMERA SLOWLY DOLLYING CENTERS COWBOY

COWBOY
No you won't. Not here.

SCULLY
Ah be still can't you?

CAMERA CENTERS SCULLY AS HE STEPS between Johnnie and Swede

EASTERNER'S VOICE
(o.s.; he walks back 
into shot)
Oh, wait a moment can't you? What's 
the good of a fight over a game of 
cards? Wait a moment.

A short pause: the eyes of all five are visible. Already the 
momentum toward war is in them and is already all but 
irresistible.

Now a series of quick shots, closer in:

SCULLY -- HIS EYES TO COWBOY

(His main meaning: How're the chances?)

COWBOY -- HIS EYES TO JOHNNIE

(His look means: Boy, will he back down on a man that accuses 
him of cheating?)

JOHNNIE -- HIS EYES TO SWEDE

(His look means: You lying son of a bitch, take that back or 
fight.)

SWEDE -- LOOKING STRAIGHT BACK AT JOHNNIE

(His look means: You know damn well you cheated).

SCULLY -- HIS EYES TO JOHNNIE

(His look means: How about it, son?)

EASTERNER -- HIS EYES AT JOHNNIE

(His look means: For God's sake let's not have a fight.)

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- JOHNNIE

The others flanking: quick, steady glances at Scully, Cowboy, 
Easterner. From each face we can see from Johnnie's face 
that he gets fuller and fuller confirmation toward fighting.

Johnnie steps from behind Scully and walks slowly forward. 
He looks very quiet and brave.

JOHNNIE
(quietly)
Did you say I cheated?

MEDIUM CLOSE QUICK SHOT -- EYES OF SCULLY, EASTERNER AND 
COWBOY TO THE SWEDE

Intense silence.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- JOHNNIE

Very gallant and graceful, waiting.

SWING CAMERA SLOWLY to lose Johnnie and bring in Swede who 
is standing still.

A short silence. The Swede looks like a liar sticking with 
his lie. Even after he finally decides, he waits a moment: 
when he speaks his monosyllable it is as if he finally jumped 
off a high building.

SWEDE
(showing his teeth)
Yes.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE GROUP

Johnnie in l.s., the Swede in r.s. For a moment everyone is 
very still.

JOHNNIE
(very quietly)
Then we must fight.

SWEDE
(instantly; roaring)
Yes, fight!

CLOSE UP -- SWEDE

SWEDE
(roaring like a demon)
Yes fight! I'll show you what kind 
of man I am!

CAMERA PULLS AWAY slowly to include the three noncombatants.

SWEDE
(continuing)
I'll show you who you want to fight! 
Maybe you think I can't fight! Maybe 
you think I can't! I'll show you, 
you skin, you card-sharp! Yes, you 
cheated! You cheated! You cheated!

By the last sentence CAMERA also includes Johnnie, who stands 
cool and quiet. A pause.

JOHNNIE
(coolly)
Well, let's get at it, then, Mister.

All five stand very still. Then Cowboy, catching Scully's 
eye, beckons him aside with his chin. The others stay still 
as they move apart toward the middle of the room.

CLOSE SHOT -- PULLING SLOWLY BACK -- COWBOY

He walks slowly, stooping next to Scully.

COWBOY
(just above a whisper)
What ya goin' to do now?

CAMERA SWINGS to include Scully, the Cowboy watching him 
closely.

CAMERA LOSES Cowboy by middle of Scully's lines, centering 
on Scully.

SCULLY
(stalwartly)
We'll let 'em fight. I can't put up 
with it any longer. I've stood this 
crazy Swede till I'm sick. We'll let 
them fight.

He turns out of shot, toward the coats. In his place, MEDIUM 
DISTANCE, we see the Easterner, his eyes on the Cowboy, very 
closely. SWING AND PULL CAMERA so that the Cowboy is again 
in CLOSE UP r.s., Easterner MEDIUM, watching him closely. In 
the Cowboy's earnest face there is deep-country blood-lust. 
He turns from the CAMERA toward the Easterner and the group 
and walks through them toward the coatroom, not speaking. As 
he walks and diminishes, the others come into view.

The Easterner holds his eye until he is past. Johnnie, hands 
hooked in his belt, is looking coolly, studyingly, at the 
Swede. The Swede, hands open and heavy at his sides, shoulders 
rounded, a little farther apart from the group than they are 
from each other, is looking calmly, darkly and a little 
solemnly, at Johnnie; in a sense he may suggest a chained 
bear which is about to be baited. It is the Easterner who 
has especially caught the Cowboy's eye and expression. His 
reaction is that strange, wavering, uncontrollable smile 
with which some people, to their astonishment and shame, 
react to news of catastrophe. Just before the Cowboy gets 
out of their range the other two glance toward him. Johnnie, 
with a little smile, looks back into the Swede's eyes. The 
Swede, looking sweaty, ungainly and bashful, looks at the 
floor.

The Cowboy walks on between them and toward the coat-corridor: 
Johnnie is the first to follow him; then the Swede, with a 
curious lethargic doggedness, looking almost sleepy; then 
the Easterner, as shakily as if it were he who was going to 
fight. In the b.g. Scully is already hunching into his coat.

MOVING SHOT

CAMERA PULLS BACKWARD through the coat-corridor (lighted by 
lamp) past Scully, who is now buttoning up his coat. The 
only SOUNDS are breathing, carefully controlled, and the 
SOUNDS of clothes and feet. Johnnie comes up to Scully and 
past him, for his coat; a silent exchange of glances, the 
son calm, the father calm and proud: Johnnie slips into his 
coat easily and gracefully. Only he and Scully are completely 
calm. The Cowboy, with excited hot eyes is putting on his 
fur cap with shaky hands. Johnnie meets the Swede's eyes 
very coolly, almost humorously, as the Swede muscles through 
for his coat. In this highly charged atmosphere all of the 
men try their best not to touch each other, but the Swede, 
in ungainliness, does touch Johnnie as he passes. A cold 
little smile from Johnnie; Swede tightens his mouth.

As we PULL BACK, and the Easterner works his way in, the 
Cowboy catches his eye; the Easterner's glance quickly drops. 
The Swede looks at nobody and nobody looks at the Swede except 
when they are sure he will not see. The Easterner and the 
Swede get to their coats at about the same time. The Easterner 
is very nervous; he has trouble finding the sleeve of his 
coat but he finally makes it. The Swede wraps a thick knitted 
muffler high around his throat. He is very thick-fingered 
buttoning his leather coat and, in spite of his efforts to 
subdue it, we HEAR him begin to breathe heavily. The Easterner 
watches his clumsiness; he clearly has a sudden impulse to 
help and he clearly knows that he must not. The Swede puts 
on his foolishly small cap and tries to pull the too-small 
flaps down over his ears; the cap would obviously not stay 
on in a fight; he takes it off, looks at it for a moment, 
and hangs it back on a hook.

Those who are already in their coats start drifting away 
from the CAMERA into the main room and out of shot; the Swede 
and the Easterner are alone at this last moment. Almost 
timidly, the Easterner looks up into the Swede's eyes, 
obviously thinking hard about something; perhaps even about 
to speak. The Swede walks past without even seeming to see 
him. The Easterner, with the helpless and fatal look of a 
piece of foam snapping over the lip of a waterfall, follows 
him.

LONG SHOT -- MAIN ROOM -- FRONT DOOR IN DEEP R.S.

The shot is made from the corner opposite the door, inward 
end of the room, past the stove, including the side table 
and lamp.

SCULLY
(at the door, calling 
the stragglers who 
are already halfway 
up the room)
Well, come on.

With their very differing gaits, they all hurry up a little.

Scully opens the door. STORM NOISE. A terrific blast of wind 
makes the lamp struggle at its wick, a puff of black smoke 
springs from the chimneytop as the men hurry out; the stove 
gets the cold wind next: its voice swells to equal the roar 
of the storm and there is the frightening crackling and 
hammering of hot metal too abruptly chilled; SWING CAMERA 
DOWN as some of the scarred and bedabbled cards are caught 
up from the floor and dashed helplessly against the end wall, 
(some, including a face card or two, hang flat against the 
wall a few inches from the floor) with SOUND of closing door, 
these cards start to fall; before they reach the floor,

QUICK CUT TO:

Outdoor violence as, with lowered heads, the men plunge into 
the tempest as into a sea.

MEDIUM SHOT -- PAST FRONT DOOR -- EXT. HOTEL (NITE)

The CAMERA is medium close to the door, waist-high, shooting 
past the door toward the station, as they stumble out. FULL 
SOUND of a very strong wind, but more compelling than any 
other noise, a pure electric or electronic SOUND, without 
timbre, either so high it is just at the limit of audibility 
or so high that it is just beyond that limit and works purely 
on the nervous system (experiment will determine which is 
better used in this context).

There is no falling of snow; the wind is so strong it makes 
them stagger and stumble; they all bow deep and turn their 
backs to the wind as promptly as if they saw God; the wind 
blows great whirls and clouds of flakes, streaming southward 
with the speed of bullets. Though we have known from inside 
that a strong wind is blowing, this exceeds all expectation: 
a solid shrieking roar like flame, plus the supersonic scream, 
which is on a high dead level.

BOOM SHOT

A little above head-height, leads their floundering along 
the hotel faade toward the station, (leeward side of the 
hotel). As they flounder into a thigh-deep drift we hear the 
shapeless illegible bawling of the Swede,

SWEDE
(rough approximation)
I haven't got a chance against you 
bastards.

CAMERA DIPS a little toward them into a fairly CLOSE SHOT as 
Scully waits, puts a hand on his shoulder, and projects an 
ear.

SCULLY
(shouting: it is just 
possible to hear him)
What's that you say?

SWEDE
(bawling)
I say, I won't stand much show against 
this gang. I know you'll all pitch 
on me.

SCULLY
(hits him reproachfully 
on the arm; yelling)
Tut, man!

Violent wind.

SWEDE
(booming)
You're all a gang of...

Wind obliterates the word.

They start again, CAMERA PULLS AHEAD of them all, facing 
them; brings in the corner of the hotel and swings swiftly 
into the lee of the building as the Cowboy and Johnnie turn 
in. Immediate and striking diminution of NOISE: but SUPERSONIC 
NOISE is not diminished. CAMERA with them, facing the wall, 
they walk a few paces in and stand waiting, fairly close to 
the wall, Johnnie looking toward the corner, the Cowboy toward 
the CAMERA. There is a little light from one first-floor 
window (coat corridor); its shade is drawn.

MEDIUM SHOT -- DOWN PAST JOHNNIE AND COWBOY

An irregular v-shape of heavily encrusted grass amid this 
great devastation of snow. A long faint rectangle of light 
from the window.

SOUND of crackling of feet on grass o.s.; both heads turn 
sharply.

MEDIUM SHOT -- EASTERNER, SCULLY AND THE SWEDE

They come around the corner. CAMERA at Cowboy's distance 
from the corner but a few feet farther out from the wall.

SWEDE
(still bellowing as 
they come up)
Oh I know what kind of a thing this 
is! I know you'll all pitch on me! I 
can't lick you all!

SCULLY
(turning on him 
'panther fashion'.)
You'll not have to whip all of us. 
You'll have to whip my son Johnnie. 
An' the man what troubles you durin' 
that time will have me to dale with!

SWING CAMERA to center on Cowboy, Easterner and Johnnie. The 
latter is quiet, noncommittal; a spasm of contempt on the 
Cowboy's face; the Easterner's teeth are chattering, he is 
stomping his feet and is as jittery with cold as a jumping 
jack.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE

His big head pivoting as he looks from one to another 
sullenly, still suspicious. Scully takes him by the upper 
arm and leads him cumbrously, CAMERA SWINGING and PULLING 
BACK a few feet, away from the wall and into shot with 
Johnnie, who steps forward into shot; Scully grabs Johnnie's 
upper arm too. The Cowboy comes in close behind Scully; the 
Easterner close behind the Swede, (in l.s.) the Easterner 
alone among the men, is still trying to keep himself warm.

SCULLY
(in a voice of iron 
authority)
All right now. Fight as ye are: ye'll 
not strip in this weather. Bare fists 
to a finish, no holds, no kneeing, 
no kicks, no gouging. Fight to be 
ended when ayther man calls quits or 
at me own discretion. That 
satisfactory?

Johnnie and the Swede glance at Scully briefly and at each 
other briefly. The Swede nods.

JOHNNIE
Suits me.

They keep on looking at each other, the Swede very pale and 
still; Johnnie serene yet ferocious. Both are taking care 
not to blink but the Swede blinks once; on Johnnie's face, 
noting it, a calm flicker of contempt.

Scully plants a hand on each chest and sets them away from 
him and apart just out of each other's reach.

SCULLY
(as he sets them apart)
Now await me signal and abide by me 
instructions.

They raise their fists, Johnnie with something of the 
suppleness of a good modern boxer of his time; the Swede 
bearish and archaic, slightly suggesting early 19th century 
boxing prints, pumping his fists just perceptibly. He stands 
solid as rock, very heavy and dead on his feet but looks 
hard to knock off them. The Cowboy, hands on sprung thighs 
like a shortstop, face tight, eyes brilliant; the Easterner 
hugging his arms, looking sick, glancing intently from fighter 
to fighter. It is while CAMERA CENTERS on him or during his 
close up that the storm seems to get its long mellow cry.

CLOSER SHOT -- SWEDE

The Cowboy and the Easterner are not in the shot unless in 
the b.g. Pretty close on the Swede, CAMERA at about shoulder-
height: he is pale, motionless, terrible; SWING to Scully, 
the iron-nerved master-of-ceremony; then to Johnnie, serene 
yet ferocious, brutish yet heroic; PULL AWAY and CENTER on 
Scully with the Swede in r. s. and Johnnie in l.s.

SCULLY
(after a sharp glance 
to each of them)
Now!
(no manual gesture)

A NOTE ON THE FIGHT: This is to be a sensational fight but 
not in any traditional melodramatic sense of that. It is 
extremely violent but spasmodic, full of unskillfulness, and 
very clumsy -- the clumsiness enhanced by heavy clothing and 
by occasional veerings onto patches of glare-ice. Though the 
violence is of itself shocking, the chief shock or sensational 
element is getting the shock of two essential amateurs, non-
fighters, in something close to mortal combat: almost as 
disconcerting as if one saw a couple of clergymen trying to 
beat each others' brains out. This can be arrived at through 
the ice, heavy clothes, ungainliness and lack of skill. It 
is also clear that you can kill a man whether you know how 
or not. Both soon learn that in such heavy clothing 
practically all that's worth trying to hit is the head; though 
Johnnie, assuming that the Swede is soft in the middle, tries 
pumping them into his belly with hard loud smacks of fists 
against leather. The fight is not shot in detail or from 
either fighter's angle, but as the spectators see it -- not 
very clearly. SOUNDS of blows and breathings are way up. 
Insofar as possible, the best fight would come of ad libbing 
it, barring a few junctures necessary to the story.

The two men crash together like bullocks and there is a 
perplexity of flying arms. We so exaggerate the SOUND of the 
crash that the audience feels it like a kick in the belly; 
and instead of any sparring or fooling around they instantly 
start socking with all their speed and strength. Both are 
evidently trying for instant and pulverizing victory; also 
it is very thoroughly a hatred-fight. They work with this 
intensity as long as their first wind and strength holds. 
They veer side to side and back and forth enough in this 
first phase that the CAMERA has to waver back and fill a 
little, but nothing special -- except that it should not 
frame them too carefully or neatly. The spectators, moving 
slightly when they need to, get into and out of shot ad lib. 
As they first crash and sock, a squeezed curse, -- it is 
indistinguishable from which fighter. (For 'curse,' try saying 
the first 2/3rds of "God" and "Christ" simultaneously, from 
between tight teeth).

CLOSE SHOT -- THE EASTERNER

His pent-up breath explodes with a pop of relief from the 
tension of the preliminaries.

COWBOY
(o.s., a sort of Texas 
yowl)

CLOSE SHOT -- THE COWBOY

In mid-yowl and in mid-air; he lands on his feet again and, 
hands on knees, looks intently.

CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY

Immovable as from supreme amazement and fear at the fury of 
the fight which he himself had permitted and arranged.

SOUNDS of fight are strong o.s. over all these shots.

CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE AND JOHNNIE

and as suggested above; till they draw away to get their 
wind; and they now come at it more cautiously. After some 
sparring and some wild misses, the Swede becomes impatient 
and tries to be a bulldozer; by his sudden drive toward the 
CAMERA, the fighters all but knock it over, and the CAMERA 
has to "step" quickly aside, mindful for a moment only of 
its footing, as the fighters pass in a blur.

MEDIUM SHOT -- REVERSE ANGLE

The fighters are past the CAMERA which now, reversed on former 
position, shoots away from the hotel wall; the three 
spectators come slowly into the shot, flanking and back-to. 
The drive continues though Johnnie is now giving near as 
good as he gets; but retreating a little and wheeling. 
Wheeling, they almost simultaneously hit glare-ice. Johnnie, 
surer-footed, keeps his feet, the Swede falls heavily 
backward, to some extent saving himself with one hand. Scully 
comes up to them fast, the CAMERA nearly as fast; he 
needlessly stays Johnnie with one hand for Johnnie is standing 
a little too close over the Swede.

JOHNNIE
(with what breath he 
has, but not jumping 
him)
Get up. Get up and fight. Get up.

Scully has lifted his other hand as if for a count but the 
Swede grunts:

SWEDE
I ain't out.

JOHNNIE
Don't lay there all night then you 
yellow...

SCULLY
Shut up Johnnie it was no true fall. 
The man's got a right to...

But already the Swede lumbers to his feet, dukes ready.

SCULLY
(staying the Swede)
Git back off the ice both o' yez.

He leads them in toward the hotel, the CAMERA PULLING BACK 
with them, and steps back to the edge of shot, skidding a 
little himself.

A second's hesitation, the Swede seeming a little slow and 
stunned, then Johnnie drives in on him with terrible 
intensity, the Swede covering up clumsily, Johnnie working 
mainly on the head.

CLOSE QUICK SHOT -- THE COWBOY

Looking much more excited than before.

Johnnie is delivering hard, fast blows against the Swede's 
hands which are trying to guard his head, and is then 
hammering clublike wrists on the bowed nape of the Swede's 
neck.

COWBOY
(yelling and springing 
forward into the 
shot)
Go it Johnnie! Go it! Kill him! Kill 
him!

Scully comes into shot quickly.

CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY AND COWBOY

SCULLY
(barring him)
Kape back.

By his glance the Cowboy can see that this man is Johnnie's 
father. Scully's manner in this must be something to respect.

MEDIUM SHOT -- THE FIGHTERS

Johnnie is still hammering but has grown wholly careless of 
his guard. Suddenly the Swede uncorks a sonofabitch to the 
belly which doubles Johnnie, and misses a lulu to the head 
as Johnnie ducks and backs off, getting his guard up; then 
the Swede lands a wild one to the head which Johnnie 
sufficiently covers and glances off that they are now again 
somewhere near even. The Swede rushes it, taking as much as 
he gives, which is plenty.

CLOSE QUICK SHOT -- THE EASTERNER -- WATCHING MEDIUM SHOT -- 
PAST THE EASTERNER

A monotony of unchangeable fighting which is an abomination. 
Both horribly skid but stay on their feet. As soon he has 
his balance, the Swede closes and pours it on; Johnnie regains 
equality; they lurch so near the Easterner that he has to 
scramble hastily backward and we HEAR them breathe like men 
on the rack.

CLOSE SHOT -- THE EASTERNER

His sickened face, wishing it would end, no matter how.

COWBOY'S VOICE
(o.s., bellowing)
Kill him Johnnie! Kill him! Kill 
him!

CLOSE SHOT -- THE COWBOY

By the middle of the foregoing line. His face is contorted 
like one of those agony masks in museums.

CLOSE UP -- SCULLY

SCULLY
(icily, to Cowboy)
Keep still.

The Cowboy leans into the shot, puzzled and offended, looking 
at Scully and Scully at him.

SOUND o.s., of a sudden loud grunt, incomplete, cut short; 
their eyes toward the fight.

MEDIUM SHOT -- FROM ANGLE OF SCULLY AND COWBOY

Johnnie's body swings away from the Swede and falls with 
sickening heaviness. The Swede, with a kind of wild animal 
snarl, (roughly, Arghrgh) is obviously about to swing himself 
headlong on Johnnie.

UPWARD SHOT -- ACROSS JOHNNIE

SOUND o.s., of running as the Swede hovers. The Cowboy runs 
into MEDIUM CLOSEUP and interposes an arm.

COWBOY
(to the Swede)
No you don't! Wait a second!

Scully hurries into the shot, nearer us, standing but leaning 
over his son like a mother to a crib.

SCULLY
(tenderly)
Johnnie! Johnnie, me boy! Johnnie! 
Can you go on with it?
(he is looking 
anxiously down)

Bring CAMERA down into a CLOSE SHOT, almost upside down from 
our angle, of Johnnie's bloody, pulpy face.

Scully squats and his head returns into the shot, close above 
Johnnie's. A moment of silence.

JOHNNIE
(in his ordinary voice)
Yes, I... it... yes.

Scully's arm under his nape and then his shoulders, tenderly, 
nearest to us; clumsy, humiliated and piteous getting-up and 
helping-up, mostly back-to the CAMERA. CAMERA LIFTING to 
level of the standing men, brings in the Cowboy and the Swede 
in b.g.,

COWBOY
(still rumbling)
You wait a second.

The Easterner steps into the shot at r.s., a hesitant hand 
toward Scully's sleeve.

As Johnnie gets fully to his feet, the CAMERA PULLS AROUND 
his left shoulder; Scully still has an arm across his back; 
the Easterner comes closer into the shot on the far side of 
Scully. But the moment he gets his footing, Johnnie moves to 
throw off his father's arm and veers toward the Swede, fists 
readying, but obviously weak.

SCULLY
Wait a bit now till you get your 
wind.

COWBOY'S VOICE
(o.s.)
You wait a second.

EASTERNER
(a hesitant hand at 
Scully's sleeve, a 
low sick voice, 
pleading)
Oh, this is enough! This is enough! 
Let it go as it stands. This is 
enough!

During this speech, the CAMERA has PULLED AROUND so that 
Scully is in full face CLOSE UP, the Easterner a pinched 
profile at the side. Scully acts exactly as if he hadn't 
heard except that his face gets hard as iron. We hear the 
SOUND of Johnnie's wavy breathing but his face is not in the 
shot.

SCULLY
(coldly)
Bill.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- COWBOY -- FROM SCULLY'S ANGLE -- SWEDE 
BEHIND HIM

The Cowboy says nothing; an enquiring look.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY AT CENTER, EASTERNER AND JOHNNIE

SCULLY
(still more iron in 
his voice)
Git out o' the road.

SOUND o.s. the Cowboy's backward step.

MEDIUM SHOT -- FULL FACE, FULL LENGTH -- THE SWEDE

Cowboy one more step back and at side. The Swede, fists coming 
up, starts slowly, stonily forward.

MEDIUM SHOT -- FULL FACE, FULL LENGTH -- JOHNNIE

Scully stepping out of shot toward the CAMERA. Johnnie is 
more cautious and much less arrogant than before: still half 
stupid from weakness.

After Johnnie's advance is started, the CAMERA PULLS OUT, 
facing the wall and opposite the referee's position (the 
three spectators pull close into a bunch), HOLDING Johnnie 
in the shot in r.s., the Swede coming in from the left. The 
Swede aims a lightning blow that carries with it his entire 
weight. Johnnie, despite his daze, miraculously dodges. His 
(Swede's) fist sends the overbalanced Swede sprawling (far 
side of Johnnie, almost fouling up his feet) a brutally heavy 
fall to shoulder and a hog-like grunt; a burst of cheering 
from the three onlookers. The Swede cuts it short by scuffling 
agilely to his feet and coming in berserk abandon at his 
foe. Another blinding perplexity of flying arms and again, 
not from any particular blow we can distinguish, Johnnie 
swings away and falls, even as a bundle might fall from a 
roof. The Swede staggers out of l.s. as the three others, 
and the CAMERA, hurry to Johnnie.

The CAMERA fetches up opposite Scully as he stoops, shooting 
from a little above him, down on his face and on Johnnie. 
Johnnie is lying on his face, the bloody backs of his unfisted 
hands, are near his head, rather like a sleeping baby's, on 
the snow. LOWER CAMERA CLOSER on to him, to height of Scully's 
stooped head; TILT TO CLOSE UP of Scully's heartbroken face.

MEDIUM CLOSE -- AT HEAD-HEIGHT -- COWBOY AND EASTERNER

They are standing but leaning. The Cowboy is looking down, 
past Scully, at Johnnie; so is the Easterner at first; then 
he looks out l.s. toward the Swede.

MEDIUM SHOT -- THE SWEDE -- FROM EASTERNER'S ANGLE

He is leaning heavily against a little wind-waved tree, 
breathing like an engine, while his savage and flame-lit 
eyes roam from face to face... a mysterious and lonely figure, 
waiting... a splendor of isolation in his situation.

CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER

His sad but awed reaction, still looking toward the Swede; 
his eyes turn to Johnnie.

CLOSE THREE SHOT -- JOHNNIE, SCULLY AND COWBOY

Almost vertical over Johnnie as Scully and the Cowboy (who 
has come opposite Scully) gently turn him onto his back, 
their arms sustaining his head and chairing his shoulders a 
little off the ground. The faces of Scully and the Cowboy 
are hardly visible at this angle, and are drastically 
foreshortened, so that the upper face of each looks like 
some kind of grotesque mourning mask. Johnnie's face, cradled 
up toward nearly vertical CAMERA, is also somewhat 
foreshortened but much less so. It is ghastily beaten, 
bloodied, cut and swollen, eyes shut, neck limp; head far 
backward and point of chin highest at start of shot, then up 
through normal view into aforementioned foreshortening; then 
again to normal view. Blood has matted his dark hair to his 
forehead and over one eye. Ice and snow are on his face like 
a broken mask.

SCULLY
Are you any good yet, Johnnie?

Nothing from Johnnie.

With his free right hand, tenderly as a woman, Scully smooths 
back the clotted hair from the smeared, smooth, very young-
looking forehead, and wipes away the ice and snow.

Johnnie gasps and opens his eyes languidly.

JOHNNIE
(after a moment)
No... I ain't... any good... any... 
more.
(he begins to cry)
He was too... too... too heavy for 
me.

As Scully gets to his feet, PULL CAMERA up and back to center 
on him in MEDIUM CLOSE UP from the Swede's angle. Cowboy and 
Johnnie low in r.s., the Easterner still closer in l.s., 
watching Scully. Scully straightens up.

SCULLY
(evenly)
Stranger, it's all up with our side.

The Easterner's eyes to the Swede, quickly back to Scully.

CLOSE UP -- SAME ANGLE -- SCULLY

SCULLY
(quietly tragic)
Johnnie is whipped.

MEDIUM SHOT -- SWEDE

Without replying, he leaves his tree, walks toward and past 
them, CAMERA keeping him centered, the Easterner's eyes 
following him, Scully not moving or looking at anything: 
CAMERA SWINGS with the Swede (who passes between it and the 
hotel wall) and HOLDS ON HIM as he passes out of the lee of 
the house to where the wind hits him like a Mack truck and 
tears at his clothes; he disappears bowed-over deeply, back-
to the storm.

CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER

His eyes return from the Swede, absently and indifferently, 
toward Johnnie. He is chiefly aware that he is freezing. 
Bring up SOUND of storm strongly.

CLOSE SHOT -- COWBOY

His crumpled, leaning face, from Johnnie's angle.

COWBOY
(whispering)
Tsah-right Johnnie. Tsah-right kid. 
We'll fix him. We'll sure fix him.

CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY

His eyes are still on the Swede's face but are out of focus. 
He has not moved since his surrender. His face has changed 
only in looking still older, more stern, more sad, more 
tragic. He lowers his eyes and stoops toward Johnnie.

CLOSE THREE SHOT -- CENTERED ON JOHNNIE

The Cowboy has him half-sitting; Cowboy's profile r.s., 
Scully's comes into shot at left; Johnnie's eyes are avoiding 
everything. Scully puts out a hand toward an instinctive 
caress and quickly withdraws it.

SCULLY
Johnnie, can you walk?

JOHNNIE
Did I hurt... hurt him any?

SCULLY
Can you walk, boy! Can you walk!

JOHNNIE
(with robust impatience)
I asked you if I hurt him any!

COWBOY
Yes, yes, Johnnie, he's hurt a good 
deal.

SCULLY
(to Cowboy)
Let's get him up, Bill.

CAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK and up with them:

They get well under him and lift; he winces and gasps in 
spite of himself.

SCULLY
Aisy does it. That's the ticket.

COWBOY
How's 'at now?

Johnnie savagely shakes off their hands, totters toward the 
CAMERA, quickly gets his bearings and turns, walks between 
them and leads them, back-to the CAMERA, toward the corner 
of the hotel. Scully and the Cowboy fall in, timidly guardian-
like, just behind each shoulder; the Easterner, who has not 
moved since the Swede left, falls in behind them.

BOOM SHOT -- THE GROUP

From just above and ahead of them as they flounder along 
past the faade of the hotel toward the door. Storm SOUNDS 
up.

The Swede's staggering, shapeless tracks are still conspicuous 
in the difficult snow; Johnnie, in the lead, avoids making 
use of them. After a few paces he flounders badly in the 
drift near the door: the Cowboy and Scully, flanking him, 
are alert but still shy to touch him. They are all practically 
blinded by the blowing snow. After another couple of steps 
Johnnie is about to fall: the Cowboy comes swiftly to him, 
obviously shouting something the screaming wind tears away 
from us; Johnnie fights him off furiously and lunges ahead, 
CAMERA stooping swiftly as he falls: the Cowboy swiftly to 
him; Scully's heartsick face is disclosed as the Cowboy 
stoops, and Easterner's frozen face behind him as Scully 
leans; the CAMERA on down to the Cowboy and Johnnie as the 
Cowboy picks him up as if he were a child and staggers with 
him up the drifted steps, Johnnie protesting violently, Scully 
hurrying ahead to get the door open.

FULL SHOT -- MAIN ROOM -- INT

From same position of last interior shot, from deepest indoor 
corner. For perhaps a half-second, SOUND of ferocious 
crackling of the stove and the wrestling trouble inside the 
lamp in l.s., then the door closes; we hear the SOUND of 
falling cards; the lamp rights itself and burns steadily.

The Cowboy, painfully embarrassed, is just setting Johnnie 
on his feet; the Easterner has just got inside; Scully is 
shutting the door. The Cowboy is slow, embarrassed, careful 
not to walk ahead of Johnnie; Johnnie, rubber-legged and 
intensely humiliated, wobbles toward the stove; Scully is at 
his shoulder, taking great care not to touch him or say 
anything; the Easterner, the last in, walks as fast as he 
can past them and up to the stove -- CAMERA ADJUSTING to 
center on him -- almost as if he would embrace the stove: he 
is desperately cold and his face looks like ice. We look 
past the stove at his face and past that as the CAMERA DOLLIES 
into position where all the chairs will be visible, MEDIUM 
CLOSE. As the others come up, the Easterner quits hogging 
the stove, moves aside to l.s. chair nearest the wall; Johnnie 
sinks into a chair and, folding his arms on his knees, buries 
his face in them.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY

Standing, Scully warms one foot and then the other at the 
rim of the stove; he shakes his head quietly, looking down 
at the hot shoe, making tst-tst-tst with his tongue.

SWING CAMERA to the Cowboy, also standing; removing his cap 
with a dazed, rueful air, running one hand through his tousled 
locks. SOUND o.s., of the floor creaking and a heavy step; 
he glances toward the ceiling sadly and grimly.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY

SOUND of another creak or step. He doesn't look up; his head 
bows a little.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- GROUP

On the stove, and beyond it, the dining room door. CAMERA at 
standing height shooting downwards across Johnnie's bowed 
head (he is back-to us); the Easterner's subtle, melancholy 
profile; the slack hands and bodies, not the heads, of the 
two standing men. o.s. the SOUND of another creak or footstep; 
minimal reaction from the men; then a sudden bursting SOUND, 
the noise of a door flung open, (we can see a little of this 
and of those who enter, past the stove in b.g.): the Easterner 
listlessly raises his eyes as the CAMERA lifts swiftly past 
the bovine head of the Cowboy and the resigned, caught-with-
pants-down head of Scully, to catch the wife and daughter 
swarming in, oh-ohing and ad libbing brogue lamentations.

Mrs. Scully shoulders swiftly past the men toward Johnnie; 
CAMERA closes onto her in CLOSE UP, at her speed, above 
Johnnie. She is a wiry, fierce, worn-out woman of 55.

MRS. SCULLY
(crossing to him)
Did he hurt ye child did he hurt ye 
so bad?
(she squats in front 
of him)
Lookit me Johnnie let me see yez.
(Under this Johnnie, 
from his first hearing 
of them, has been 
shrinking into himself 
and now mutters across 
her line)

JOHNNIE
(muttering)
Cut it out Ma...
(a couple of half-
whispered words, 
covered by loud talk 
from her...)
...sake cut it out!

But she is tugging at his wrists and putting a hand under 
his forehead to lift his face while he still groans, head 
muffled in hands,

JOHNNIE
Please! Please! Quit it! Le' me be!

But he knows there's no use and she gets his face up (away 
from us) and gives a close quick look and then a low keening 
wail as tears spring out of her and she turns loose of his 
stubborn humiliated head to bring her hands incompletely 
toward the primordial gesture of tearing her hair at the 
temples.

MRS. SCULLY
(hands distrait in 
the uncompleted 
gesture: a wailing 
sob)
Ohh, me boy! Me little boy! And him 
sitchy charmer! Lookit 'im Katy! 
Jist lookit that! Ohh ain't it 
dreadful, did you ever see sitch a 
starin' horror!

With "and him sitchy charmer," CAMERA PULLS BACK and up a 
little; through the rest of her lines and, the CAMERA, from 
the same position, does quick flicking shots like glances of 
the eye, centering reactions of one or another of the men in 
turn and of the daughter -- shots A, B, C, et seq. The 
daughter meanwhile is horning in ad lib with "Ohh," and "Aww" 
and "Johnnie dear," "ain't it just awful," "it's a sinful 
shame," etc., and by a violence of gesture and voice, Mrs. 
Scully drags CAMERA (by quick cut and a shade belated) back 
to MEDIUM CLOSE UP of herself past Johnnie's bowed head.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- MRS. SCULLY

As she flings herself on her knees before Johnnie, catches 
his face between her hands, already talking loudly.

MRS. SCULLY
(in a mixture to her 
son and the room at 
large)
Crazy ye are, jist outa yer mind, 
an' him a man twice his age an' size, 
the great bullyin' murderer...

JOHNNIE
(across her lines, in 
rage, humiliation 
and disgust)
Get away, cut it out, quit it I tell 
ya, I ain't hurt bad, I'm all right...

SCULLY
(leaning weakly into 
shot, aghast with 
disgust and sympathy 
for Johnnie; in a 
weak voice)
Molly!
(she neither hears 
nor sees him)
Molly! Please! Molly! Hush now! Molly! 
Not here. Molly!

Mrs. Scully does a slow take on him when she finally hears 
him, cuts off her former lines and whips her head at him.

MRS. SCULLY
(with cold fury)
Shut up an' keep outa this, you! 
Haven't ya done enough, standin' by 
while a man half kills my baby boy?
(her eyes rake all of 
them)
Crazy men! Bloodthirsty brutes!
(her daughter echoes 
her less noisily, ad 
lib)

Mrs. Scully starts bustling up from her knees, CAMERA RISING 
with her.

MRS. SCULLY
(rising)
Poor darlin'! Crazy boy, brawlin' 
young fool, now jist come with mother, 
gently darlin', come darlin', kin ye 
walk, son? Come on, let's bathe the 
poor blood off an' fix 'im up comfy.

Johnnie meanwhile is still protesting ad lib and is trying 
at least to walk alone, as he had with the men, but not a 
chance; they wholly disregard his gestures of pride, his 
efforts to shake them off. With ad libs of "Silly boy," and 
such, they cling to him like limpets, helping him out past 
the stove and thence toward the dining room door.

CAMERA meanwhile, SLOWLY TRACKS crabwise, parallel with the 
wall opposite the coatroom, so that until they get past the 
stove they are in a kind of Recessional from the CAMERA.

They reach the far side of the stove from the CAMERA

MRS. SCULLY
(straightening; 
reproachfully)
Shame be upon you, Patrick Scully! 
Yer own son, too! Shame be upon you!

DAUGHTER
(ad lib)
Shame, shame.

Scully has huddled meekly out of their path but now comes 
close to the stove as if he needed the warmth.

SCULLY
(gently, almost 
inaudibly, meeting 
no eyes)
There, now! Be quiet now!

MRS. SCULLY
Shame, I say. Shame.

They turn toward the door on the far side of the stove; the 
CAMERA continues its crabwise glide and stops when stove 
centers and blanks out screen, but SWINGS to HOLD them as 
they half-carry Johnnie back through the dining room door, 
side and back-to the CAMERA; the door closes.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE THREE MEN

Over the SOUND of the closing door cut to a new angle, from 
the same position, MEDIUM CLOSE of the survivors. The 
Easterner, l.s., is in near profile; a crescent of empty 
chairs; the Cowboy is standing behind between two chairs; 
Scully is all but hidden by the stove. Scully walks slowly 
into the shot, sits down slowly and sadly in the chair next 
Johnnie's (next the Easterner, it stays empty); hangs his 
hands between his knees. His head is bowed; he wags it slowly, 
sighs very deeply; head still.

The Cowboy, deeply sad and embarrassed, walks slowly around 
a farther chair and sits, facing the CAMERA, staring at the 
stove. The Easterner just looks at the floor.

SCULLY
(after a long pause)
Tst-tst-tst.

The Cowboy exhales a deep damp breath through o-ed lips.

The Easterner's hand is on his knee, flat and limp except 
for the forefinger, which he slowly raises and brings down, 
repeatedly.

The Cowboy gets his sack and papers part way out, puts them 
back.

SCULLY
Tst-tst-tst.

SOUND o.s. of the creaking board in the Swede's room. From 
Scully, a short sharp intake of breath, no raising of the 
eyes. The Cowboy's eyes don't raise but they harden. He 
glances with shy calculation at Scully and at the Easterner 
and again at Scully.

COWBOY
(carefully)
I'd like to fight this here Swede 
myself.

The Easterner's hand goes still, forefinger up in the air; 
no change in his eyes.

SCULLY
(tempted for a moment, 
then, wagging his 
head sadly)
No, that wouldn't do. It wouldn't be 
right. It wouldn't be right.

COWBOY
(knowing why but making 
him say it)
Well why wouldn't it I don't see no 
harm in it.
(he looks to Easterner 
whose eyes do not 
change)

The Easterner's finger is lifted a little higher; motionless 
again.

SCULLY
(with mournful heroism)
No, it wouldn't be right. It was 
Johnnie's fight, and now we musn't 
whip the man just because he whipped 
Johnnie.

The Easterner's finger relaxes and stays flat.

COWBOY
Yes, that's true enough, but
(hopefully)
he better not get fresh with me, 
because I couldn't stand no more of 
it.

SCULLY
(commandingly)
Ye'll not say a word to him.

Under Scully's line, the SOUND of the Swede's heavy tread on 
the stairs. Hearing it, Scully makes his last couple of words 
all but inaudible. None of them look up or register hearing, 
but all go very still. The Swede enters "theatrically," his 
cap on, sweeps the stairway door shut with a bang, and 
swaggers to the middle of the room. He is dressed to go and 
carries his valise in his hand. He has washed his face but 
even from here we can see that it is bleeding again in two 
or three places. Nobody looks at him, or even looks up. All 
sit side or back to him, facing the CAMERA.

SWEDE
(loud and insolent, 
to Scully)
Well, I spose you'll tell me now how 
much I owe you?

SCULLY
(no move or look; 
stolidly)
You don't owe me nothin'.

COWBOY
(turning slowly to 
look at Swede)
Stranger, I don't see how you come 
to be so gay around here.

SCULLY
(shouting across the 
last words, a hand 
forth almost in 
Cowboy's face, palm 
out, fingers straight 
up)
Stop! Bill, you shut up!

COWBOY
(spitting carelessly 
into the cuspidor)
I didn't say a word, did I?

The Swede has been watching this, his body tightening like a 
fist, but quite unfrightened; as he sees there will be no 
fight, a sour spasm of smile.

SWEDE
(interrupting Cowboy)
Mr. Scully, how much do I owe you?

SCULLY
(imperturbably; as 
before)
You don't owe me nothin'.

SWEDE
Huh! I guess you're right. I guess 
if it was any way at all, you'd owe 
me somethin'. That's what I guess.
(he pivots fast and 
rigidly and takes 
two paces toward the 
Cowboy; then, leaning 
forward, stiff-legged 
from his heels, and 
mimicking even the 
Cowboy's agony-mask, 
screams)
Kill 'im! Kill 'im! Kill 'im!
(he guffaws 
victoriously)
Kill 'im!

He is convulsed with ironical laughter. He watches them with 
great interest and delight all the time he laughs. He bites 
it off sudden and cold. There is an arrogant and expectant 
silence.

But the three men are immovable and silent. As throughout 
this act of the Swede's, they stare with glassy eyes at the 
stove. They hold it while he waits for trouble, and while he 
walks leisurely to the front door and, with one last derisive 
glance at the still group, passes into the storm.

After the door closes (omit all former STORM EFFECTS except 
a moment's howl of wind while the door is open) hold a few 
seconds of absolute stillness. Then the Cowboy and Scully 
jump up and begin to tramp around. The Easterner stays very 
still in his chair, hardly, if at all, even looking at them; 
but listening.

COWBOY
(whipping from his 
chair; fist hard 
into palm)
Unh! Byg! Golly!

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- REVERSE ANGLE -- COWBOY

He circles behind his chair; he is finishing the above line; 
the first words of Scully lines, o.s., come over this shot; 
Cowboy's eyes to him.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY -- PAST COWBOY

His fists are shaking with great intensity near his temples; 
he is working his way out between the chairs and toward the 
Cowboy.

SCULLY
Oh, but that was a hard minute! That 
was a hard minute! Him there leerin' 
an' scoffin'!
(he is pretty CLOSE 
now, WHEEL CAMERA 
for TWO SHOT, still 
favoring Scully)
One bang at his nose was worth forty 
dollars to me that minute! How did 
you stand it, Bill!

The Cowboy and Scully are equal in the shot now.

COWBOY
(a quivering voice)
How did I stand it? How did I stand 
it? OH!
(a violent fist through 
the air)

CAMERA PULLS BACK a little, follows Scully. Scully begins 
paddling back and forth in front of the Cowboy (who stands 
sort of treading water, making hard little shadow-boxing 
jabs); Scully's hands are close together; his shoulders are 
hunched, he is rapidly hammering fist into palm and wailing 
in deep brogue:

SCULLY
Oi'd loike to take that Swede and 
hould him down on a shtone flure and 
bate 'im to a jelly wid a shtick!

COWBOY
(up to him and almost 
groaning in sympathy)
I'd like to git 'im by the neck and 
h-ha-aaammer 'im...
(speechless, a hand 
down on a chairback 
with a SOUND like a 
pistol shot)
...hammer that there Dutchman till 
he couldn't tell himself from a dead 
coyote!

Toward the end of the Cowboy's lines, CAMERA favors Scully's 
reaction.

CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY

Eyes to the Cowboy leaning into upper l.s., Scully is almost 
crying with the lust of this kind of self-abuse.

SCULLY
I'd bate 'im until he...

CLOSE SHOT -- COWBOY

Past Scully's round little head.

COWBOY
(tries to speak; unable)

CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY -- FROM COWBOY'S ANGLE

He looks grateful, even loving -- and as if he could hardly 
wait, and as if he wants to prompt him like a stutterer.

CLOSE SHOT -- COWBOY

COWBOY
(he looks loving too)
I'd show him some things...

CLOSE SHOT -- SCULLY

Satisfied, nodding very rapidly but curtly; almost the 
masculine equivalent of an old-maid gossip's 'yes-yes-yes.'

CLOSE TWO SHOT -- COWBOY AND SCULLY

Faces contorted, a kind of gloating; as if embracing in 
operatic duet, they look almost straight into the lens.

COWBOY AND SCULLY
(almost in unison: a 
yearning, fanatic 
cry)
Oh-o-OH! If we only could...

They look at each other with breathless and terrible yearning 
and again speak almost in unison.

COWBOY
YES!

SCULLY
YISS!

The CAMERA SWINGS to lose them, bringing in their inane 
shadows on the wall opposite the lamp, chasing each other in 
circles.

COWBOY'S VOICE
(o.s.)
An' then I'd...
(a sock)

SCULLY'S VOICE
(o.s.)
Yis, an' I'd...
(more socking)

COWBOY'S VOICE
(o.s.)
Yeah, an I'd...
(a terrific blow on 
the air; four hard 
fast jabs, a gigantic 
uppercut, hard 
breathing)

SCULLY'S VOICE
(o.s.; a fierce grunt 
of hatred and effort; 
he kicks something 
which is prostrate)

COWBOY'S VOICE
(o.s.)
A-aaahhh!
(he jumps up and down 
on it)

SCULLY'S VOICE
(o.s.)
Oh-o-OH!

COWBOY'S VOICE
(o.s.)
Oh-o-OH!

Over Scully's grunting and kicking

CUT TO:

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE EASTERNER

He is staring at the stove, hands slack on his knees; he is 
listening keenly. As contempt and self-contempt increase in 
his face beyond silence, CREEP CAMERA INTO CLOSE UP.

EASTERNER
(quiet but piercing)
Oh, stop it!

MEDIUM SHOT -- SCULLY AND COWBOY -- NEUTRAL ANGLE

They are as arrested by his words as in a stopshot. They 
look toward him, more surprised than offended.

COWBOY
How's that, pardner?

SCULLY
(at same time)
Eh?

MEDIUM SHOT -- EASTERNER -- SAME POSITION, NEW ANGLE

EASTERNER
(quietly contemptuous)
I said, stop it.
(he gets up and walks 
toward CAMERA and 
out of shot toward 
the front of the 
room. Over his next 
line, CAMERA SWINGS 
across Cowboy and 
Scully, watching 
him, astonished; 
loses them and again 
picks up Easterner 
as he nears the 
stairway door.)
Surely there's some limit to 
childishness and cowardice and shame!

COWBOY'S VOICE
(o.s.)
What's eatin' you, Mister?

The Easterner pauses abruptly at the door.

EASTERNER
That's all. I'm going to find that 
Swede and try to make up for what 
we've done to him.

He goes through the door and starts upstairs.

MEDIUM SHOT -- SCULLY AND COWBOY -- FROM ANGLE OF DOOR

Slowly, dumbfounded, they turn and look at each other. o.s. 
SOUND the Easterner's footsteps and, just audible, a train 
whistle.

LONG SHOT -- EXT. (NITE)

Shooting down the narrow boardwalk from the corner of town 
(edge of a building in r.s. toward the hotel and station. 
Minimal lighting. Same SOUND of shrieking wind and blowing 
snow as before; same SOUND of storm and high, timbreless 
scream at the edge of audibility. The line of the boardwalk 
is marked by a little line of naked, gasping trees. In the 
deep distance, when blowing snow allows, we see the small, 
single, stinging light of the station.

The Swede is about halfway between the hotel and the edge of 
town, coming toward us floundering, struggling into the eye 
of the wind, with terrifying spirit and energy -- carrying 
his big valise and now and then clutching his cap almost 
like Harry Langdon. Within a few seconds (see note below for 
method) he comes a full hundred yards. CAMERA shoots him at 
shoulder height, a little upward toward his face. As he gets 
nearer an ordinary CLOSE UP the CAMERA PULLS BACK. For a 
moment he just wags his head a little, fast, almost 
paretically, looking all around; growing in his face is a 
hunger for enormity, violence, bragging, love, glory, 
something, anything so long as it is huge enough to meet him 
half-way. Suddenly he opens his mouth and yells at the top 
of his lungs -- then stands, like an idling locomotive, 
breathing quiet and fast through clenched teeth. Then his 
hands begin to move; fists hitting the air. Becoming aware 
of the suitcase, heavy in his right hand, he mingles grinning 
and weeping and moaning and hits it as hard as he can with 
his left fist, and drops it and kicks it twice, three times, 
as hard as he can. It isn't enough for his desperation and 
joy; again he scans the darkness; and suddenly, with his 
right fist, he hits himself as hard as he able on the joint 
of the jaw. He reels a little with the blow and whispers 
something, and stoops and picks up his valise (CAMERA adjusts 
to these violences). As he straightens and starts down the 
street into the middle of the town, he is smiling with a 
strange peacefulness and hope and sweetness -- a tired Pilgrim 
on the homestretch to Paradise.

The CAMERA PANS as he passes closer, and centers on him as 
he plods down the middle of the snow-foundered, lightless 
street.

(A NOTE ON THIS SHOT): It is to be heightened above realism, 
during the Swede's advance up the boardwalk. When he is still 
in the deepest distance, we use only every third frame; then 
every second; then cut every third frame; then every fourth; 
meanwhile slurring the CAMERA speed a little, fewer frames 
per second, so that his speed of approach is at all time 
superhuman and grotesque, but becomes smoother as he 
approaches. By the time his features become distinct no frames 
are skipped but the motion, though regular, is fast and dry 
rather than silky; it is at this time and pace that the train 
is run through. As he comes into full close up, shade back 
to normal speed, omitting no frames. The SOUND runs smooth, 
not clipped; it is not recorded on the spot.

MEDIUM SHOT -- MAIN ROOM -- INT

The staircase door; o.s. the SOUND of the fast train quickly 
dies. The Easterner comes through the door with his traveling 
bag, ready to go. His eyes meet Scully's o.s., and he pauses. 
He is quiet and grave.

MEDIUM SHOT -- COWBOY AND SCULLY -- FROM EASTERNER'S VIEWPOINT

They stand waiting for him in the middle of the room and 
looking at him with a kind of mystified grimness.

SCULLY
(quiet and reasonable)
Now Mr. Blanc, what's all this about?

MEDIUM SHOT -- THE EASTERNER

He walks toward them, extending his hand

MEDIUM CLOSE THREE SHOT -- SCULLY, COWBOY, EASTERNER

As the Easterner walks into the shot, offering Scully coins,

EASTERNER
(quietly)
Here's what I owe you Mr. Scully.

SCULLY
(not accepting)
What's your complaint? I thought we 
was friends here.

EASTERNER
Please. Take it. There's no time to 
waste.

Scully makes no move to accept the money.

COWBOY
(incredulous)
You fer that Dutchman?

SCULLY
Yes, what is this about the Swede?

A brief pause: the Easterner's feeling conquers his aversion 
against going into it. They watch him judicially.

EASTERNER
(quietly)
We've done him a great wrong.

COWBOY
(astounded)
Huh?

SCULLY
Wrong! We couldn't treat him fairer -- 
we never touched a hair of his head!

EASTERNER
(quiet but feeling it 
strongly)
Ah you don't know the meaning of 
fairness. Either of you.

They move nearer him; he stands his ground. CAMERA SLOWLY 
CREEPS CLOSER.

COWBOY
Now you look here, Mister...

SCULLY
(Solemn and quiet; 
slowly tapping 
Easterner's chest 
with his forefinger)
See here, Sir: guest or no guest, 
nobody can tell Patrick Scully he 
ain't a fair man.

EASTERNER
Suppose I prove it.

SCULLY
Try, just. Fair enough. But Mister: 
ye better make it shtick!

COWBOY
That goes for me too.

EASTERNER
Very well.

He sets down his bag as the CAMERA stops advancing: A CLOSE 
THREE SHOT, favoring the Easterner. He looks coldly from one 
to the other as he talks. They watch him judicially.

EASTERNER
When the Swede said Johnnie was 
cheating, and Johnnie called him a 
liar, it was one man's word against 
another. Am I right?

They nod, with a look, "of course."

EASTERNER
That was all we had to go on to 
prevent a fight. Correct?

SCULLY
Correct.

EASTERNER
All right.
(very quiet and cold)
Did it occur to either of you that 
the Swede might be telling the truth?

CLOSE TWO SHOT -- COWBOY AND SCULLY

COWBOY AND SCULLY
(together; vaguely)
Truth?

CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER

He is watching them mercilessly.

EASTERNER
(icy; just audible)
Mm-hm. That's the word.

CLOSE TWO SHOT -- COWBOY AND SCULLY

COWBOY AND SCULLY
(gaping, incredulous, 
innocent)
HIM?

CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER

He watches them a moment very tensely, then abrupty relaxes.

EASTERNER
(throwing it away)
Thank you, gentlemen: there's your 
proof.
(again trying to pay)
Now please...

CLOSE THREE SHOT -- EASTERNER, COWBOY, SCULLY

CAMERA circles, favoring each man as he speaks.

SCULLY
(intensely)
Are you accusin' Johnnie of...

EASTERNER
(quiet, cold)
I'm accusing nobody. I'm proving you 
don't know the a-b-c-'s of fairness.

COWBOY
But that Dutchman, he's crazy.

EASTERNER
(biting the words out)
Stick to the point.

SCULLY
If he ever did tell the truth -- an' 
that I beg leave to doubt -- it'd be 
the first time in his life.

EASTERNER
That would make it a lie?

COWBOY
Good as a lie.

Scully nods.

EASTERNER
Fine. Splendid.

CAMERA, shooting past the Easterner, favoring the Cowboy, 
stops circling.

COWBOY
Why, that bird, if he did tell the 
truth, I wouldn't keer.

CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER

EASTERNER
(to both)
You've proved my point several times 
over; don't strain yourselves.

His eyes glide quietly from man to man.

CLOSE TWO SHOT -- COWBOY AND SCULLY

A pause. They are cornered; half-comprehending, deeply 
resentful. They are in some degree trying to face it.

CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER

In deep stillness he watches them.

CLOSER TWO SHOT -- COWBOY AND SCULLY

The effort to face it weakens; they glance toward him almost 
reproachfully and look quickly down; they glance toward each 
other but their eyes don't meet. Each does his equivalent of 
a shrug.

LESS CLOSE SHOT -- THE EASTERNER

He looks at them in silence a moment.

EASTERNER
(quietly)
That's right; shrug it off; it's a 
small matter. It's why wars are 
fought; why a great nation can fall 
apart like rotten meat.

COWBOY'S VOICE
(o.s., booming)
Yeah? Well what're you...

CLOSE SHOT -- COWBOY

SWING CAMERA to bring in Scully, reacting.

COWBOY
(continuing)
...talkin' so high and mighty about, 
I want to know! You was there too, 
but I didn't notice you sayin' 
nuthin'!

The shot now favors Scully.

SCULLY
(eager, vindictive)
Now how about, yes how about that! 
Tarred with the same brush, ain't 
you?

They look to him in bitter triumph.

CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER

A pause as he returns their gaze.

EASTERNER
(with calm self-
loathing)
Oh no. A blacker brush.
(still quieter)
You see: I knew.

CLOSE TWO SHOT -- COWBOY AND SCULLY

They are held in a strange, prescient pause.

CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER

EASTERNER
(very quietly)
Yes: Johnnie was cheating.

CLOSE TWO SHOT -- COWBOY AND SCULLY

COWBOY AND SCULLY
(blankly)
Johnnie...

CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER

He nods, watching them closely.

CLOSE TWO SHOT -- COWBOY AND SCULLY

A silence. We can almost see their wheels go round. Finally, 
relief and pleasure dawn in the Cowboy's face. As he starts 
to speak he makes a foolish, rather pathetically helpless 
gesture, and CAMERA PULLS AND SWINGS to bring in the 
Easterner.

COWBOY
Why, no. We wasn't playin' fer money. 
It was just in fun.

Scully nods, hopefully. The Easterner's reaction to the word 
"money" is quiet, sick, ineffable contempt.

EASTERNER
(unconsciously; just 
audibly)
Oh, yes!

The MOVING CAMERA now favors the Easterner in the THREE SHOT

EASTERNER
Fun or not, Johnnie was cheating. I 
saw him. I know it. I saw him.

A pause.

SCULLY
(solemnly)
Mister: I don't believe you.

EASTERNER
Why would I lie to you?

COWBOY
That's for you to tell us.

In spite of everything, there is a flicker of amusement in 
the Easterner over this lulu.

SCULLY
(shrewdly)
Ye lied before or now, by yer own 
admission. I'll take me pick.

EASTERNER
(mildly)
I lied when I kept quiet.

SCULLY
Why? If ye saw what ye claim?

A pause. CAMERA moves into CLOSE SHOT of the Easterner, losing 
them.

EASTERNER
(quietly)
Cowardice.

CLOSE TWO SHOT -- SCULLY AND COWBOY

They can't comprehend or believe such an admission.

CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER

EASTERNER
That's all.
(his eyes show us 
they still can't 
understand; with 
self-contempt and 
weary patience)
We hated the Swede; you believed 
Johnnie; you liked me. I wasn't man 
enough to make enemies of you. I let 
that poor fool fight it out alone.

He looks from man to man in silence.

CLOSE TWO SHOT -- SCULLY AND COWBOY

They are silent a moment.

SCULLY
(quietly)
Then why're ye tellin' us now?

CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER

EASTERNER
Because there's a limit to cowardice.

CLOSE TWO SHOT -- SCULLY AND COWBOY

A short silence as they ponder that.

COWBOY
(solemnly)
Mister, if you're tellin' the truth, 
you're makin' yerself out the 
yallerist coward ever I seen.

CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER

PULLING BACK, as he speaks, into a CLOSE THREE SHOT

EASTERNER
Oh, we're all cowards; that's the 
root of the trouble. Johnnie is behind 
us; you're afraid to face the truth 
about him and your own unfairness; 
I'm just the worst of a bad bunch.

A short pause.

SCULLY
(bitterly)
I s'pose that Swede's your idea of a 
hero.

EASTERNER
He was the only brave man here 
tonight.

SCULLY
Brave? Him?

COWBOY
Him? His knees was knockin'!

CLOSE SHOT -- EASTERNER

EASTERNER
(new realizations 
breaking open)
Sure; he was scared sick. My bet is, 
he's been sick all his life, with 
cowardice. What a living hell! But I 
guess he reached his limit too. He 
stood up to it tonight -- worse fear 
than we'll ever dream of. And beat 
it too -- sure as he beat up Johnnie. 
Yes Mr. Scully, he's my idea of a 
hero. And whatever becomes of him 
now, it's our fault as much as his.

COWBOY'S VOICE
(o.s.)
Our fault! Why, that feller's just...

EASTERNER
(catching fire more)
Certainly our fault. Good heavens, 
we flatter ourselves we're civilized 
men... fit to cope with Destiny, 
Fate, the Devil Himself. And we come 
up against some puzzling minor 
disturbance like this Swede, and all 
we can do is the worst that's in us.
(a strange, almost 
clairvoyant bitterness)
Oh, we declared ourselves, all 
right... as sure as that blue-legged 
heron! Yes indeed! We made him what 
he's become tonight. We're the ones 
who've put him in danger!

SCULLY'S VOICE
(o.s.; bewildered 
scorn)
Talk sense, man! Danger!

EASTERNER
Look here. Any man is in danger who 
has spent a lifetime in fear and 
humiliation, and then suddenly finds 
his right to be alive. He's a danger 
to others, too. He doesn't know any 
better yet how to handle his power, 
than a child with a loaded gun.

He studies their baffled, hostile faces with deep intensity 
as the CAMERA PULLS AWAY into a CLOSE THREE SHOT and, with 
almost a snarl of impatience over having delayed too long 
and uselessly, reaches down for his bag. Scully's hand detains 
him.

SCULLY
Just a minute, you: Johnnie's goin' 
to have a fair hearin'.

EASTERNER
Oh by all means for Johnnie! But 
don't waste my time with it. I've...

o.s. SOUND of the dining room door opening. Instantly they 
all become very still and look toward it.

MEDIUM LONG SHOT -- JOHNNIE -- NEUTRAL ANGLE

He limps toward them, washed, but cut and bruised; partly 
undressed; on his way to bed. As he comes nearer the CAMERA 
SWINGS to bring in the other three, MEDIUM CLOSE, favoring 
Scully.

SCULLY
(quietly)
Johnnie...

JOHNNIE
H'lo, Pop.
(to the others, with 
a sad, brave smile 
as he starts past)
'Night.

SCULLY
(gravely)
Johnnie...

His tone makes Johnnie stop.

CLOSE THREE SHOT -- EASTERNER, COWBOY, SCULLY -- FAVORING 
SCULLY

SCULLY
(quietly)
Mr. Blanc has something to say to 
you.

CLOSE TWO SHOT -- JOHNNIE -- PAST SCULLY

Cutting across the foregoing line.

There is a cold, lightning-like spasm in Johnnie's eyes. 
Then he is friendly, tired, ingenuous.

JOHNNIE
Leavin' us, Mister?

CLOSE GROUP SHOT -- FAVORING JOHNNIE AND EASTERNER

The others watch them closely, but watch the Easterner sharper 
than Johnnie.

JOHNNIE
(likably)
Well what's up?

EASTERNER
(very quiet)
You cheated, Johnnie.

JOHNNIE
(smiling incredulously)
What's that?

EASTERNER
I said, you cheated. I saw you.

Johnnie looks at him very hard for a moment; then to Scully 
and the Cowboy, with the smile of a tired good-guy.

JOHNNIE
(to Scully and Cowboy)
What is this, a joke?

They are silent.

JOHNNIE
(dignified, quiet and 
reasonable)
You must of made a big mistake, 
Mister; 'cause I don't cheat.

SCULLY
(with pathetic 
eagerness)
Now how about that, Sir!

COWBOY
(forgivingly)
Anybody can make a mistake.

For several seconds Johnnie and the Easterner look hard and 
quietly at each other. Then the Easterner turns to Scully, 
again extending the coins.

EASTERNER
(not unkindly)
I owe you this, Mr. Scully.

Johnnie surges toward him but is restrained with curious 
ease by the Cowboy and Scully.

SCULLY
Now none o' that, son. There's been 
enough o' that.

EASTERNER
(to Scully)
You won't take it?

There is no answer from Scully.

EASTERNER
Well I can't keep it.

He quietly lays the coins on the floor at Scully's feet. 
Then he wipes the coin-sweat from his palms onto his coat 
and picks up his bag.

EASTERNER
(on a queer, wild 
impulse)
I'm sorry it isn't thirty pieces of 
silver.

He turns and walks away toward the door and out of the shot. 
They watch after him. The Cowboy is utterly baffled by his 
remark but Scully calls after him bitterly.

SCULLY
So now he's sacred into the bargain!

MEDIUM SHOT -- EASTERNER -- FROM THEIR VIEWPOINT

This shot cuts across Scully's line. The Easterner is still 
walking away from the CAMERA toward the front door. He stops 
and turns, looking from man to man and, at one moment, 
directly into the lens.

EASTERNER
(quietly)
Sacred enough; he's my conscience. 
Yours too, if you only knew it.

He turns away and goes out the front door.

MEDIUM THREE SHOT -- SCULLY, JOHNNIE, COWBOY

o.s. SOUND of the closing door. They watch after him. A 
silence.

JOHNNIE
(quietly)
Matter with that guy? Gone crazy?

No answer.

SCULLY
(even more quietly)
We can't let him shpread it all over 
town.

While the others start for their coats he squats and, with 
sad dignity, starts to pick up the coins. ON HIM, as he does 
so, SWIFTLY IRIS OUT.

MEDIUM SHOT -- SWEDE -- A STREET CORNER (NITE)

He emerges from almost pitch darkness into faint visibility, 
into MEDIUM CLOSE UP, looking right and left as he comes to 
the new intersection. His face lights up and he stops in his 
tracks. He is still transcendent, but much more tired than 
before.

The CAMERA wrenches through an almost 120-degree, streaking 
turn to the left of him, and stops as abruptly as it started. 
Slant-wise down the side street, fairly distant, there is a 
blur of light through furious snow. A dim sign reads BAR or 
SALOON.

CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE

With a weary, grateful air of seeing home at last, he sets 
down his valise. Then he bends over deep-below-screen and 
straightens up again and his hands are full of snow, with 
which, with great simplicity and infinite refreshment, he 
washes his cut face and hands. Then he flicks and shakes the 
wet from his hands, lifts his cap with one hand and rakes 
his other hand through his hair, replaces his cap and, his 
face alight with anticipation and new hope, almost with love, 
picks up his valise, and bevels off toward the light in a 
rigid oblique, regardless of drifts, the sidewalk, etc.; the 
CAMERA SWINGING to center on his plodding back.

QUICK FADE:

FADE IN:

INT. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE BAR -- FOUR MEN AT A TABLE 
(NITE)

It is a clean, well-lighted place; not big. A table at the 
rear; four men at it: a lawyer, a doctor, a merchant and a 
gambler.

We shoot past the Gambler's left shoulder, MEDIUM CLOSE, on 
the Doctor at our left; the Lawyer facing toward the front 
of bar, the Merchant on our right. It is self-evident by 
their looks that the three we can see are among the most 
respectable and well-to-do men in town. Smoothest of all is 
the Lawyer. Of the Gambler we see nothing yet except the 
shoulder of his coat and perhaps a rather fine hand with a 
wedding ring on it, and a soberly-jewel-linked cuff, and a 
sleeve of a suit as sober as the others, except it is an 
elegant dove-gray. They are all smoking cigars, and there 
are drinks on the table. The Lawyer is doing all of the 
talking, quietly, smoothly and earnestly; looking always 
directly into the Gambler's eyes. We soon realize he is the 
spokesman for the rest, by the way the Doctor gazes into the 
table, nodding now and then, and the Merchant gazes at the 
Lawyer, nodding more often and more sensitively; and by what 
he is saying.

LAWYER
Of course we hardly need to tell 
you, Sir, how deeply we regret it: 
Even those of us who voted against 
you on principle... and it is in our 
honorableness and candor due a friend 
that I tell you that I was one of 
them...
(the Merchant is deeply 
moved by admiration 
for all this)
...even we regretted it most 
painfully, perhaps most painfully of 
all if I may say so. After all, every 
responsible person in Fort Romper, 
every self-respecting man in this 
part of the State, knows you as a 
square gambler. You have never yet 
been known to take advantage of any 
man who didn't, in every sensible 
person's... uh... in the opinion of 
every sensible person, richly deserve 
it, one might say "ask for it". Your 
family life is exemplary. Your 
companionship is a pleasure which 
all of us hope to share for many 
years to come
(even more earnestly 
and gently)
But we do hope you understand, Sir. 
After all,
(his voice all but 
cracks with 
earnestness)
the Pollywog Club is a pleasure club. 
Oh, stakes, perhaps modest stakes, 
but among amateurs as it were;
(a feeble would-be-
charming smile)
greenhorns. Of course there isn't a 
single member of our little club who 
could imagine that you would ever... 
ever, well, as it were, uh, well, 
violate, uh, take advantage of...
(by now he is 
thoroughly miserable)
...I do hope you understand me, Sir.
(the invisible man 
just lets him fry)
But a professional gambler, after 
all. It's just the principle of the 
thing you know. The ap... the 
appearance of the thing. No personal 
offense in the world.
(pause; no help from 
the Gambler)
(miserably but with 
dignity)
I do only hope you understand me, 
Sir, how very deeply embarrassing 
this is for me... for all of us. How 
very deeply we regret it.

They wait, eyes as before. A medium pause.

GAMBLER'S VOICE
(o.s.; an even 
smoother, gentler 
voice, whose icy 
central irony totally 
escapes them)
My dear sir: friends: I wish I might 
have saved you this painful 
embarrassment. It is because I honor 
you as gentlemen and as friends that 
I know that you must meet me with 
candor, however painful that might 
be for you. I am deeply grateful for 
that candor. Allow me to meet you 
with equal candor. I think I need 
say only this: If I were a member of 
the Pollywog Club, and my own name 
or that of any other professional 
gambler were brought to a vote, I 
would have acted precisely as you 
have done, for precisely the same 
reasons, and with precisely the same 
sentiments, before, during, and after. 
In a word, I would have blackballed 
myself from the Pollywog without a 
second thought.

During this speech the Doctor and the Merchant have turned 
their eyes slowly to him in wonder and almost in unbelief, 
and the Lawyer's eyes have stayed on his, burning with a 
steadily increasing light of deep emotion. By the end of it 
they are all looking at him practically as if he were Jesus 
and could cook into the bargain.

The Lawyer's eyes are brimming; he clears his throat but he 
can't speak yet; the Merchant looks at him and now his eyes 
brim too. At last the Lawyer rises (the others hurriedly 
following suit) with his glass.

LAWYER
(all choked up; very 
quietly)
Let us stand, my friends, and drink: 
to a gentleman!

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE GAMBLER

As he rises quickly; he is elegant, histrionic; quietly 
dignified, cold as ice.

GAMBLER
(with a slight bow)
To you: gentlemen: and my good 
friends.

They all touch glasses and drink with their respective ideas 
of 18th century elegance. The Merchant, overwhelmed with 
emotion, clearly has the sudden idea of smashing his glass 
and makes the start of a gesture toward that end.

BARKEEPER'S VOICE
(o.s., gently but 
alarmed)
Hey -- Hey!

The Merchant shrivels up with humiliation like a spider in a 
flame; the Gambler's amused delight is beautifully concealed. 
He doesn't look around at the barkeeper, but modestly at the 
table. Both others glance sharply at the barkeeper.

MEDIUM SHOT -- BARKEEPER

From their angle, about halfway up the bar. His forehead is 
still wrinkled with dismay; he is awfully embarrassed to 
have spoken so sharp to such respectable folks.

BARKEEPER
(in a low voice)
'Scuse me, folks, it just slipped 
out.

CLOSE GROUP SHOT

Between the Lawyer and the Doctor, on the Merchant and the 
Gambler. The Lawyer, by his slight stiff turn of head away 
from the Barkeeper, does not even deign to grant him pardon. 
The Gambler is very quiet; an almost tenderly sympathetic 
smile behind which he is reveling in a cruel delight of ironic 
amusement. The Doctor's head rugged and quiet, a little more 
scraggy looking than before. The Merchant, crumpled with 
embarrassment, is just carefully setting down his glass. The 
Lawyer saves the situation virtually unimpaired by bowing 
slightly and formally to the Gambler, who returns it to the 
table at large; the Doctor bows, and the Merchant, a trifle 
late; as they sit down, the Lawyer gently, manfully claps 
the Merchant on the shoulder; a glance from the Merchant of 
spaniel-like gratitude. Their noble mood is addled but not 
utterly destroyed: they seek to repair it. By the Gambler's 
smile we know exactly the smile, from the Lawyer, which 
elicited it; the Merchant is trying to smile too when there 
is the o.s. SOUND of the front door opening and a stamping 
in the vestibule between the street door and the swinging 
doors: all glance toward the door except the Gambler, who 
watches the Lawyer.

LONG SHOT -- THE FRONT DOOR

Top rim of the bar in r.s. The rim of the bar is exactly 
level in perspective and sprouts from exact center of the 
right edge of the screen. An almost instantaneous shot as 
the Swede starts coming through the swinging doors.

CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE

At head height, as he comes through. He is as high and glowing 
as before, though slightly less wild; the sudden warmth hits 
him like a shock of peace and good prospect; his face softens 
and swells; his eyes flick the joint. Again a very brief 
shot; he is stepping forward.

LONG SHOT -- THE TABLE

Faces and eyes just at the end of casually looking at him; 
resuming their private conversation. This shot is as quick 
as a glance.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- BARKEEPER

At his station near mid-bar. Eyes quick from the table to 
the Swede, a quick size-up; underplayed and, again, as quick 
as a glance.

CLOSE SHOT -- DOWN ON THE SWEDE'S VALISE AND RIGHT FOOT

He plants his right shoe on the rail; it is clogged with 
snow; he stomps and scrapes rather loudly, trying to clear 
it.

MEDIUM LONG SHOT -- THE TABLE

Quick, gentlemanly glances of annoyed wondering what it is, 
finding out, gentlemanly ignoring of the boorishness; back 
to their muttons.

CLOSE SHOT -- BARKEEPER

A sharp little glance toward the table and toward the noise; 
annoyance; a tinge of refinement.

CLOSE DOWN SHOT -- VALISE AND FOOT

The Swede gets his foot hung comfortably.

CLOSE SHOT -- THE SWEDE

He settles his elbows at the bar. He is tired, almost sleepy 
with the sudden warmth; glowing like a stove; still on top 
of the world but becoming very peaceful.

SWEDE
(eyes to Barkeeper)
Gimme some whiskey, will you?

The Barkeeper walks quietly into the shot with a high-grade 
Bartender's faintly insolent politeness toward a low-grade 
customer; he plants a bottle on the bar, a whiskey glass, 
and a glass of ice-thick water.

The Swede pours himself an abnormal portion and drinks it 
down in three gulps. While the Swede pours and gulps, the 
Barkeeper, past him, pretty close in the shot, is making the 
pretension of blindness which is the distinction of his class, 
but it can be seen that he is furtively studying the 
halfraised bloodstains on the Swede's face.

BARKEEPER
(indifferently)
Pretty bad night.

No answer.

BARKEEPER
Bad night.
(his meaning is clearly 
double and quietly 
discourteous: bad 
night for you, bud, 
that's clear enough)

SWEDE
(pouring more whiskey)
Oh, it's good enough for me.

He roots under his coat and deep into his britches-pocket, 
slaps down a coin, and tosses off the new drink, eyes 
following the Barkeeper.

MEDIUM SHOT -- BARKEEPER -- FROM SWEDE'S ANGLE

Putting the coin through a highly-nickeled cash register 
with a brilliant clanging of the bell.

CLOSER SHOT -- SWEDE

As he finishes his second drink; he is heavier now yet still 
tremendously elated and at peace with himself: he pivots 
eyes and head in a slow benign sweep down the bar and in the 
direction of the table, looking toward the men, o. s., with 
towering benign vanity and self-confidence, and friendly 
interest. SOUND o.s., of a coin slapped on the bar, rouses 
him from this boozy musing.

CAMERA "adjusts" about as heavily and clumsily as the Swede 
does, to get the Barkeeper into the shot.

SWEDE
(a wave of the hand)
Keep it, keep it.

BARKEEPER
(with a tinge of 
sarcasm; the change 
is only a nickel)
Thank you sir.

SWEDE
(grandly; abstractedly)
Buy yourself a cigar.

A pause.

The Barkeeper is looking toward the table; the Swede at the 
Barkeeper. The Swede is trying to cogitate. He's somewhat 
disappointed; nothing is going as he had wildly imagined it 
would go with people, from now on; but he has just enough 
sense to realize: after all, this guy doesn't know me for 
what I am. Better let him in on it a little.

SWEDE
No, this isn't too bad weather. It's 
good enough for me.

BARKEEPER
(languidly)
So?
(he drifts a foot or 
so away, down bar)

The Swede is sweating a little; the booze is getting to him 
now; his breathing is a little heavier.

SWEDE
Yes, I like this weather. I like it.
(nodding heavy time 
to his words)
It suits me.

BARKEEPER
(after a short pause)
So?
(he turns to study 
the bar mirror)

Swede flinches, confused with disappointment and uncertain 
what to try next, follows his eye along and down the mirror.

CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE'S REFLECTION IN BAR MIRROR

Eyes glittering in the scrolled mirror, o.s. SOUND of his 
heavy breathing. After a few moments of this mirror-gazing, 
the mirror blurs a little and comes as if effortlessly back 
into focus; blurs again:

CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE FROM ANGLE OF HIS REFLECTION

He squeezes his eyes tight shut and opens them; his head is 
lower than when we saw it before; he is leaning deep and 
heavy on his elbows. Evidently triumph, melancholy, fatigue, 
loneliness, the dismay and disappointment of a dream 
confronting actuality, all balled up in him, not to mention 
the whiskey and the warmth, are all hard at work in him, 
with all the liabilities a little outweighing. It is in the 
need for counterbalance that he speaks next.

SWEDE
Well, I guess I'll have another drink.
(he pours, a heavier 
slug than before but 
slower and, raising 
his glass, needing 
company bad but trying 
to make it seem 
casual, he eyes 
Barkeeper o.s.)
Have something?

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- BARKEEPER PAST SWEDE

BARKEEPER
No, thanks, I'm not drinking.

The Swede downs his drink fast but a little more doggedly 
than before; no real relish for it; while the Barkeeper 
studies him more openly.

BARKEEPER
How'd you hurt your face?
(a tinge of mild insult 
which the Swede misses)

SWEDE
(loud and blustery; 
grateful for the 
chance)
Why, in a fight. I thumped the soul 
out of a man down here at Scully's 
hotel.

LAWYER'S VOICE
(o.s.)
Who was it?

Swede turns quickly.

MEDIUM LONG SHOT -- TABLE FROM SWEDE'S ANGLE

They are all looking at him.

CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE -- FROM SAME ANGLE -- BARKEEPER IN B.G.

SWEDE
Johnnie Scully. Son of the man what 
runs it.

MEDIUM LONG SHOT -- TABLE FROM SWEDE'S ANGLE

Their reaction is not one of overjoy.

MEDIUM CLOSE -- SWEDE

Seeing they are not as impressed as he is, he tries to better 
it by making it bigger. He is beginning to squint as if seeing 
them through a needle eye.

SWEDE
He'll be pretty near dead for some 
weeks, I can tell you.

Again he waits a reaction.

MEDIUM SHOT -- SAME ANGLE

SWEDE
(talking a little 
louder)
I made a nice thing of him, I did. 
He couldn't get up. They...

MEDIUM LONG SHOT -- SWEDE -- FROM ANGLE OF TABLE

SWEDE
(continuing)
...had to carry him in the house. 
Have a drink?

LONG SHOT -- ON TABLE FROM BEHIND BAR -- PAST SWEDE'S HEAD

The men at the table have in some subtle way encased 
themselves in reserve.

LAWYER
(voice neither pleasant 
nor unpleasant)
No thanks.

Now none of them look at the Swede. The Swede keeps looking 
at them. A couple of seconds after the "no thanks" he turns 
his face into the shot, disappointed, mixed-up and a little 
sore.

SWEDE
(to Barkeeper)
Come on, have a drink.
(he grabs the bottle 
and holds it out)

CAMERA SWINGS losing table and bringing in Barkeeper.

BARKEEPER
(shakes his head)

SWEDE
What... No? Well, have a little one 
then.
(thick fingers measure 
a little one)
By Golly, I've whipped a man tonight, 
and I want to celebrate. Whipped him 
good too.
(he turns his head 
suddenly again into 
hindside close up of 
his face. Calls loudly)
Gentlemen, have a drink?

BARKEEPER
Ssh!

The table is back in the shot now; only a fragment of the 
Barkeeper as in the start of the shot.

The Doctor looks up.

DOCTOR
(curtly)
Thanks. We don't want any more.

They all conspicuously pay "no attention" to the Swede.

CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE -- FROM ANGLE OF TABLE

The Swede is still looking toward the table, sore as a boil; 
he ruffles up like a rooster, and explodes.

SWEDE
(loudly, wavering in 
his speech between 
Barkeeper and table)
Well, it seems I can't get any one 
to drink with me in this town. Seems 
so, don't it? Well!

BARKEEPER
Ssshhh!

SWEDE
(leaning toward him, 
snarling)
Say, don't you try to shush me up. I 
won't have it. I'm a gentleman, and 
I want people to drink with me. And 
I want um to drink with me now.
(hard fist on the bar)
NOW! You understand?

BARKEEPER
(callous and sulky)
I hear you.

SWEDE
(louder)
Well, listen hard then. See those 
men over there?
(he flings out a thick 
arm)
Well, they're gonna drink with me 
and don't you forget it! Now you 
watch!

BARKEEPER
Hey! This won't do!

SWEDE
(already walking; 
chops out the words.)
Why won't it?

CAMERA is with the Swede, along his right side as he walks. 
He is in pretty large CLOSE UP, filling the right half of 
the screen, his angry profile almost pushing the right edge 
of it; the bar streaking past in left half and the Barkeeper 
hesitantly hurrying, as he walks fast and drunkenly up to 
the table. Just as he comes up, lower CAMERA a little to his 
outlifting hand and speed its SWING a little to bring in a 
flash of the men at the table, not getting up, but tightening 
in their chairs.

CLOSE SHOT -- SWEDE'S HAND

In a heavy combination of a clap and a fall, hits the gray 
shoulder of the man who happens to be nearest him -- the 
Gambler's.

CLOSE UP -- THE GAMBLER -- FROM SWEDE'S VIEWPOINT

A diminutive man, twists his head slowly and looks up into 
the Swede's eyes. From this angle he is all eyes and forehead; 
the chin looks weak.

STEEP CLOSE UP -- SWEDE -- FROM GAMBLER'S ANGLE

From this angle he is all truculent jaw and mouth, little 
glittering eyes above; apishly small upper half of head.

SWEDE
(wrathfully)
How about this? I asked you to drink 
with me.
(his eyes flick sorely 
and quickly toward 
the others)

DOWN SHOT -- ON LAWYER AND MERCHANT -- PAST SWEDE AND GAMBLER

Keeping their seats; looking at the Swede in icy disgust.

GAMBLER
(coolly; somewhat 
melodiously)
My friend, I don't know you.

SWEDE
(roughly; trying to 
smile and be his 
idea of "Western" 
about non-
introductions)
Ahh, come on and have a drink!

CLOSE SHOT -- DOCTOR, MERCHANT, LAWYER

All eyes to the Swede, all registering their respective kinds 
of well-bred silence

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- BARKEEPER

Opposite the table, behind his bar; sprung like a ready 
trigger; watching everyone very carefully.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- GAMBLER AND SWEDE

Gambler very low in screen, the Swede very high, past the 
Doctor in f.g.

GAMBLER
(face still up-turned; 
coolly and with mock-
kindness but very 
firm; very much the 
gentleman)
Now, my boy, take your hand off my 
shoulder and go 'way and mind your 
own business.

ZOOM CAMERA TO EXTREME CLOSE UP OF SWEDE, slanting up at him 
a little.

SWEDE
What! You won't drink with me, you 
little dude? I'll make you then! 
I'll make you!

On the first "I'll make you" he is rapidly stooping; STREAK 
CAMERA DOWN TO EXTREME CLOSE UP of his hands and the Gambler's 
face; the hands are already grabbing him by the throat and 
dragging him from his chair, over noise of scraped-back chairs 
and rising ad libs of Hey! stop! Great Scott! Stop him!

CUT OVER THESE SOUNDS AND WORDS MEDIUM SHOT -- THE GROUP

Past the three men at the table, centering on the Gambler 
and the Swede, (SOUND of running Barkeeper and his ad libbing 
o.s.). The three men are rising in their far from rough or 
halfway ready way, to help; but everything is too fast for 
them. The Gambler almost instantly stops resisting the upward 
drag and gets up, throwing the Swede off balance; pivoting 
as he rises so that he drives the Swede behind the chair 
toward the wall opposite the bar; getting under the Swede's 
clumsily placed elbows with his whole left arm and shoulder 
and lifting as he rises so that the Swede's whole slick and 
shiny chest and belly of leather coat bulges taut, swollen 
and shiny as a watermelon, catching highlight from the bar 
light. Just while it can still be visible before the pivoting 
hides it, he reaches deftly into his trouser pocket and pulls 
out something; the snap of a spring and a long blade flicks 
out, flashing the same highlight we have just seen on the 
Swede's soft belly. SOUNDS of breath drawn in sharp with 
horror. The Gambler's arm straightens back, drives forward; 
a horrifying SOUND as the blade enters the leather (on far 
side of fighters from us), and a deep weird groaning grunt 
from the Swede.

CLOSE UP -- SWEDE

Almost a head taller than the Gambler, whose back is to the 
shot. The Swede's eyes and mouth are amazingly wide: pain in 
them, but far more, supreme astonishment: childlike.

Low in the shot the Gambler, not too easily, (SOUND o.s.) 
extracts the knife and vanishes out of the shot to the left 
(we don't see his face) as CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER ON THE 
SWEDE.

The Swede is drawing as deep a breath as his lungs can hold; 
eyes and mouth are now even more wide and amazed; then, very 
long and slow and gentle, incredulous, downward-trailing to 
a damp breath, he utters the Swedish word for "no," which is 
"nej," pronounced 'nay,' in a tone almost beyond sorrow and 
wonder but partaking of both: he begins to step backward 
very slowly, CAMERA gently and implacably following, and 
gaining on him a little, very gradually; and still more slowly 
to sink; CAMERA ditto: at the end of the "Nay" his chin 
trembles a little, the staring eyes alter, one tear runs out 
of each:

As the two tears spring out, a SWIFT THRUST OF CAMERA up to 
the eyes -- not too close;

THEN CUTTING:

NOT DISSOLVING:

and with great rapidity: The supersonic tone used pianissimo 
at first and steadily increasing to ultimate unbearable 
intensity, behind all the shots: likewise a subsonic tone, 
same intensification.

In a huge soft radiant CLOSE UP involving munificent crystal 
and mahogany and a spray of potted palmleaves, over distant 
male cheers and discreet streaming SOUNDS of high grade dinner 
music, the Swede and the Gambler, in soup and fish, touch 
glasses, smiling, courtly; in b.g., the vague-focused heads 
of the three other men raise glasses; superimposed for a 
fraction of the time it takes him to say it, the Barkeeper 
in smiling CLOSE UP saying, "It's on the house, gentlemen."

Over brass disc of music of suppertime, very faint, Scully, 
Easterner, Cowboy rush to congratulate him by his tree just 
after the fight.

Over same music, indoors by the stove, Johnnie, battered and 
sheepish, nods and grins as he lifts the Swede's hand as the 
victor's.

Over same music, a little louder, Swede in CLOSE UP, his arm 
around Johnnie's shoulders, both faces beaten up, both 
grinning as Scully, grinning, in l.s., offers the yellow-
brown whiskey bottle.

Over the SOUND of transcontinental express, an unknown good 
looking well-bred blonde woman of a ripe thirty-five loses a 
look of hauteur and smiles up at him promisingly.

Over train and disc music a whole parlorfull of floozies in 
negligee hasten, happily, to swarm around an advancing CAMERA.

A fearsome heavily-mustached blond man in clothes of lower 
middle-class Sweden (circa 1860, -- his father), glaring 
down into the lens over the SOUND of whipping and child's 
crying, suddenly smiles beautifully and benignly: total 
approval and respect as eyes and lens lift and come level: 
no whipping SOUND: then scowls again.

The immense vague tender face of a young woman, shot from 
the angle and nearness of a baby looking up from the crook 
of her elbow; over the SOUND of a warm untrained contralto 
half-humming a lullaby or folksong in a foreign language, 
she gazes with infinite tenderness and pity into the lens.

SOUND of impact of a tremendous blow, exploding 398-H into a 
white flash and recovering into a close image of Johnnie 
past his still landing fist.

Easterner, from earlier, his mouth saying, "I don't understand 
you": but silent.

From the Swede's viewpoint: Johnnie does something shady 
with the cards.

A long line of hard men in a dark bar look up rather 
dangerously at the advancing CAMERA over the SOUND of swinging 
doors.

CLOSE detail-shot of "The Stag at Bay," very dark. (The 
HIGHSOUND is by now very strong; no other SOUNDS.) Then SOUND 
of child's crying o.s.

A little boy pulverizing the face of another little boy who 
is crying and not hitting back. LOUDEN SOUND of child's 
crying; begin lullaby.

Face of the Father, closer and fiercer: same SOUNDS.

Swede in EXTREME CLOSE UP at the corner of the town in fullest 
magnificence. He is not shouting but add the SOUND of his 
shout, at a great distance, to the other SOUNDS.

The tigerish reflection in the mirror; continue shout and 
other SOUNDS.

Same small boy alone, face beaten, crying: SOUND of crying.

Again the huge vague maternal face: silent except for HIGH 
SOUND which is now at its peak!

EXTREME CLOSE UP -- SWEDE

His mouth is almost closed now, his eyes are still wide; he 
slowly, mournfully, wags his head once to and fro as he sinks: 
the eyes again alter and slowly freeze into an expression of 
unutterable horror, dread, recognition and grief. The film, 
with this change in eyes, very gradually darkens, by darker 
printing: the eyes remain fixed on the same o.s. spot, just 
off lens, and it is as if they now die and the rest of him 
is merely trailing them. CAMERA stops following him: he backs 
against the edge of a little side table; gropes backward 
with one hand; fumbles backward between two of the small 
tables which line the wall and backs between them to the 
bench and slowly lets himself down and, within a second more, 
is still. After a second of this stillness (make it a stop 
shot and stop the HIGH and LOW SOUNDS) his eyes are still 
fixed on the same spot.

MEDIUM LONG SHOT -- THE GROUP

The Swede is just out of the shot beyond r.s. The Gambler 
stands just where we left him; his knife, point downward is 
still in his hand. Only the Doctor moves. After perhaps three 
seconds of immobility he comes through his friends and past 
the Gambler and over to the Swede, CAMERA SWINGING with him, 
SOUND of his shoes very quietly crackling on the sanded floor. 
When he gets to the Swede he stands sufficiently between us 
and the Swede that we can't see what he's doing, but it isn't 
much -- no need for it to be. Then he straightens up and 
turns, with desperate eyes, and goes back past the Gambler 
and his friends, CAMERA SWINGING, same quiet, sandy SOUNDS, 
and gets his coat. As he lifts it from the coatrack.

MERCHANT
(softly)
O my Gahhd-uh. O my Gahhhd-uh.

He turns and starts toward his coat and stumbles against a 
chair as if he were blind. The Lawyer reaches out swiftly, 
as to catch him should he fall; he doesn't; the Lawyer gently 
pushes-helps him to the coatrack, a hand against his nearest 
upper arm; they start getting on their coats. The Lawyer is 
quick, the Merchant clumsy as a child; the Lawyer helps him; 
the Doctor, all set, starts toward the front door.

MEDIUM SHOT -- GAMBLER

He faces the bar squarely (the Swede is not in the b.g.). He 
is standing very straight and graceful, almost military, 
facing the CAMERA, looking to l.s. He is managing this with 
terrific effort and his knees are just visibly trembling. 
SOUND of the Doctor's footsteps; the Gambler's eyes moving 
steadily with him: he comes across close, l.s. to r.s.; the 
Gambler's eyes on his. The Doctor doesn't look at him; he is 
so scrawny and rugged with shock and distress he looks sick 
and ten years older. He crosses the shot and out. The 
Gambler's eyes very quietly to l.s. again: 3 flicks of his 
eyes, to height of the Lawyer, the Merchant and then the 
Lawyer again, swinging with them. They enter and cross the 
shot, side by side; the Merchant on the far side of the Lawyer 
and almost totally obscured by him.

MERCHANT
(half-moaning)
O my Gaaahhhdd-uh, my Gaaahhdd-uh.

He says this about every five seconds from the time he starts 
to his exit, ever more moistly, softly, calflike, never 
louder. The Lawyer's head, close, high in screen, is desperate 
icy granite, noble Roman; his eyes, which look straight 
forward, unseeing as a statue's. The Gambler's eyes follow 
as they exit right screen.

LONG SHOT -- THE FRONT DOOR

The rim of the bar in the middle of the edge of r.s., and 
level in perspective. The Lawyer very erect, an arm across 
the Merchant's shoulders; the Merchant caved in and stumbling 
as a widow. Now they either just avoid stumbling, or stumble 
brutally against, the Swede's valise; then on, not looking 
back, and out the door.

MEDIUM SHOT -- THE GAMBLER

SOUND of closing door. Very slowly he lifts his knife and 
looks at it. Again by terrific effort he brings the trembling 
of the blade down to just perceptible. After a long pause he 
lifts his eyes toward the Barkeeper, o.s.

GAMBLER
(very quietly)
May I have your bar-cloth, please.

MEDIUM SHOT -- BARKEEPER

BARKEEPER
(limply; almost 
inaudibly)
Yes, sir.

He walks unsteadily up the bar for the cloth, toward the 
edge of the shot, while the Gambler walks even more slowly 
to the bar; his back, like his front, expressive of terrific 
shock and incredible control.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- GAMBLER AND BARKEEPER

As they converge at the bar, Barkeeper extends the cloth 
delicately and the Gambler takes it as delicately. Gambler 
nods thank you. The Gambler wipes his blade and as he does 
that his hands and knees start trembling badly in spite of 
himself. With an almost suicidal effort he controls the 
trembling and makes the faintest beginning of handing the 
cloth back to the Barkeeper, who winces very faintly; then, 
reaching carefully rather than tossing, he puts the cloth on 
the bar. He folds his knife and puts it in his pocket.

GAMBLER
(in an unearthly calm, 
dry voice with a 
scratchiness 
underneath)
Charlie, you tell 'em where to find 
me. I'll be home, waiting for 'em.

The Barkeeper tries to speak; he can't; he nods, then nods 
again.

The Gambler walks into the shot and past the CAMERA and 
returns, within a couple of seconds, walking into the shot 
and away, back-to; his hat is already on; as we first see 
him he is finishing shrugging into and settling his overcoat; 
and now, by faint motions of hands and elbows, as he 
continues, we know he is buttoning it. It must be clear that 
though he walks very erect, calm, and even, he is scarcely 
able to stand up. He takes a long slanting line to avoid the 
valise; rectifies the line the instant he passes it; and so 
out the door. (Under all these exits use SOUND of feet on 
sanded floor).

The Barkeeper, who leaned back against the bar as the Gambler 
went for his coat, stays there very still a moment after the 
door shuts; then up the bar, knees wobbly, a hand on the bar 
sustaining him now and then, to the bottle on the bar at the 
Swede's place. He lifts the bottle and the Swede's glass, 
puts down the glass and drinks from the bottle, deeply. The 
inevitable violent reaction of a kind of writhing of his 
whole interior; a kind of gobbling SOUND. Then a great HUH 
expulsion of breath: then loud deep breathing, stunned eyes 
wandering vacantly. Then we see that they must light on the 
Swede, o.s., for they stop abruptly, and so does the 
breathing. Then after a couple of seconds the breathing begins 
again, great HUHS, but this time much more terrible shattering 
with shock and with a kind of dry sobbing: an off-balance 
pump: HUH -- uhhhhh: dead silence: HUH -- uhhhhh: dead 
silence. He takes two almost sneaky steps toward the door; 
hand reaching behind and untying his apron: then sprints 
ungainly, his apron fouling legs and feet and kicked aside 
as if it were a snake, with another awful HUH -- uuuhhh 
carrying him at high speed through the door. No SOUND of 
closing door, but SOUND of the scream of the storm, very far 
down.

BARKEEPER'S VOICE
(o.s.; retreating in 
the street and muffled 
in the storm, bawling, 
bestial)
Helllllp! Murrrrrder! Helllllp!

HOLD SHOT ON BARE BAR and perspective of its rim, through 
these lines.

FULL SHOT -- THE WHOLE INTERIOR (ORTHOCHROMATIC FILM)

A formal shot from the dead center of the front of the room: 
a shot modeled on postcards of 1890-1910: our first full 
view of the nicest bar in a small town: pathetic but not 
completely unsuccessful in its efforts at a kind of barren 
charm and grace. The sand on the floor in the f.g. is swept 
in pretty curclicues; these are scuffed along the bar and 
where the fight took place. HOLD three or four seconds, long 
enough to register fully the Swede and the cash register, 
dead-opposite each other, at exact middles of their sides of 
the room. No storm SOUND: pure silence.

EXTREME CLOSE UP -- THE SWEDE'S LEFT EYE (ORTHOCHROMATIC)

Occupying the whole screen except enough to show a little of 
a contused cheekbone and across it, a crooked rill of dried 
blood and a snailtrack shining of a not yet dried tear. The 
eye, if technically possible, is glazing as we watch. Silence.

EXTREME CLOSE SHOT -- THE CASH REGISTER (ORTHOCHROMATIC)

The ornate cast-iron top of the nickel-plated cash register. 
Its florid shape recalls the florid cornice of the Blue Hotel. 
The cash amount is below-screen. The stamped lettering of 
the legend is fiercely cold, glittering, massive and hard -- 
a little ornate like much of the lettering of the time:

THIS REGISTERS THE AMOUNT OF YOUR PURCHASE

o.s. SOUND of a door opening. HOLD the shot a couple of 
seconds after it.

FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE EASTERNER

As he comes through the swinging doors, advances a couple of 
paces, and stops dead in his tracks as his eyes find the 
Swede. An impulse to go to him is instantly arrested; it is 
so clear that he is beyond help. Almost unconsciously, he 
sets down his traveling bag. A freezing anguish of guilt 
enters his still face.

After a sufficient pause to make clear they did not come 
with him, Scully, Johnnie and the Cowboy come in, quietly, 
but winded. They also look, see, and are silent. They try to 
subdue their breathing. They have left the street door open 
and we can see that there is no more storm or SOUND outside.

The Easterner is aware when they come in; we feel that he 
even knows who they are. But throughout the scene, he never 
shifts his eyes from the Swede; and they shift theirs only 
rarely. Throughout, they stand behind Easterner.

After a considerable silence:

SCULLY
(in a subdued voice)
How did it happen?

The Easterner says nothing. A pause.

COWBOY
(quietly too)
You ask me, that feller was lookin' 
for trouble. An' he sure found himself 
a plenty.

A pause.

EASTERNER
(in a strange, vague 
voice)
Looking...?
(more firmly, but 
very quiet)
Like all troubled men.
(pause)
And we helped him find it, and we 
trapped him into it.

A pause. The three men behind now glance at each other.

SCULLY
(a little less subdued)
See here, Mister.

The Easterner says nothing.

SCULLY
Just one thing.

EASTERNER
(quietly)
Go home.

SCULLY
Just one little thing. Johnnie an' 
me live in this town. We don't want 
no stories shpread around that ye...

EASTERNER
(as quietly)
Go home. Stop worrying. Tell whatever 
story you please.

SCULLY
Ye mane ye -- ye won't...

EASTERNER
Your conscience is your business. 
Each one of you. My own is enough 
for me to cope with.

They linger, unsure and weary.

EASTERNER
(with deep exhausted 
bitterness)
So just go home now. Leave me alone.
(pause)
If you please!

A silence.

SCULLY
(quietly and solemnly)
We didn't have no part in it.

The three shake their heads, but they don't look at each 
other.

EASTERNER
Every sin is a collaboration. 
Everybody is responsible for 
everything.

The three look unsurely at each other; they are obscurely 
abashed.

SCULLY
(with a slight gesture 
and an almost 
inaudible whisper)
Come on.

Each looks a last time toward the Swede, each in his own 
strange way, kind of gloomy, shy, foreboding reproach and 
resentment; and each, one by one, turns away from the CAMERA 
and walks quietly outdoors and out of the shot. We hear only 
the SOUND of the faint squeaking of their shoes on snow, and 
soon this dies.

With the absolute silence an even more fierce and living 
quiet intensifies in the Easterner's face and becomes, as 
well, sorrow, pity, tenderness, a passionate desire for, and 
hopelessness of, expiation. The face rises on a high wave of 
realization, almost transfigured, on the verge, even, of 
mysticism, yet iron, virile, tragic -- as, very slowly, his 
eyes still fixed toward the Swede, he walks into extreme 
CLOSE UP and PAST THE CAMERA out of the shot.

THE CAMERA HOLDS for a few seconds on the swinging doors, 
whose subtle breathing stops. Beyond them, through the open 
door, the air is utterly still.

LONG SHOT -- THE BLUE HOTEL -- SAME AS THAT WHICH OPENED THE 
PICTURE

Three tiny figures walk in single file down the home stretch. 
In the immense silence we can just hear their feet. They go 
in. Light gapes and vanishes, as the door opens and closes. 
After a few seconds, light appears in the upstairs windows. 
After a few more seconds, the downstairs light goes out. 
Then one upstairs light. Then the other. The sky is emblazoned 
with a freezing virulence of patterned stars.

Almost inaudibly, deep in the distance, o.s. SOUND of a train 
whistle. In the silence after it, the cold stars sharpen; 
and very slowly, like a prodigious wheel, the whole sky begins 
to turn.

FADE OUT:

THE END

Duck Soup (1933)

Screenplay by

Harry Ruby, Bert Kalmar and Grover Jones



The story begins with an opening shot on the exterior of the 
executive mansion.  It is a gala day.  Soldiers are lined up 
in front of the entrance; expensive cars and carriages are 
arriving and depositing distinguished notables from the 
adjoining countries.  Two trumpeters at the head of the stairs 
announce the arrival of each notable.

In the large reception hall, Mrs. Teasdale, wife of the late 
president, is greeting the newcomers.  The room is filled 
with distinguished guests.  At the moment we see Mrs. 
Teasdale, she is talking with a notable.  In the near 
background is a group of distinguished men, members of her 
own cabinet.  Her words to the notable are not lost on them, 
and as she begins to praise the new dictator, there is the 
exchange of disapproving glances.

MRS. TEASDALE
It is so good of you to come.

NOTABLE
An honor, Mrs. Teasdale...  You must 
indeed have great faith in your new 
dictator to give him such a 
magnificent reception.

MRS. TEASDALE
I feel that Rufus T. Firefly is the 
only logical successor to my dear 
departed husband.  He has the 
statesmanship of Gladstone, the 
humility of Lincoln, and the wisdom 
of Pericles.

The notable kisses her hand once more and leaves the scene.  
As he does, the background group moves into Mrs. Teasdale.  
Their spokesman addresses Mrs. Teasdale.

FIRST CABINET MEMBER
(Protestingly)
Mrs. Teasdale, as members of 
Freedonia's cabinet, we do not approve 
of your choice.  Who is this Rufus 
T. Firefly?

SECOND CABINET MEMBER
(Waving aloft a paper)
A stranger in our midst, an agent 
for the Eureka Ammunition Company.  
Think of it, Gentlemen, an ammunition 
salesman dictating the policies of 
our peace-loving country.

THIRD CABINET MEMBER
Reconsider, Mrs. Teasdale, before it 
is too late.  The citizens of 
Freedonia want a President!

MRS. TEASDALE
As the widow of your last president, 
I have the right to choose -- and, 
Gentlemen, I refuse to discuss the 
matter any further.

Mrs Teasdale turns her back on them, leaving them to mumble 
among themselves.

From off scene comes a servant's voice, announcing:

SERVANT
His Excellency, Ambassador Verdi 
Trentino of Amnesia!

Cut... to the archway.  We see Trentino enter with a beautiful 
brunette at his side.  He is followed by two or three of his 
fellowmen.  He moves across the reception hall to Mrs. 
Teasdale, bows most graciously and presses his lips to the 
back of her hand, then introduces his companion.

TRENTINO
Mrs. Teasdale... my niece, Vera.

Mrs. Teasdale shakes the girl's hand warmly.

MRS. TEASDALE
(To niece)
Your uncle has been such a friend to 
us in every crisis.  Without his 
country's financial aid --

TRENTINO
(Lightly)
What is money?
(Tenderly)
Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do 
anything.

MRS. TEASDALE
(Flustered)
Ambassador!
(Attempting to change 
the subject)
I am so anxious for you to meet our 
new dictator.

TRENTINO
(Persistent in his 
flattery)
Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules 
Freedonia, to me you will always be 
the first lady of the land.

Trentino attempts to take her hand.  The latter is a bit 
confused, much to the amusement of Vera, who laughingly says:

VERA
Mrs. Teasdale, my uncle's hopeless -- 
you've been the only topic of 
conversation ever since we left 
Amnesia.

Mrs. Teasdale's confusion is happily interrupted by the 
announcement of a servant, off scene.

SERVANT
The Honorable Mohamed Pandooh of 
Mufhtan!

MRS. TEASDALE
(Hastily)
Oh, I must greet His Honor.

Mrs. Teasdale exits from the scene quickly.  Vera and Trentino 
look after her, then Vera laughs softly, as their eyes meet.

VERA
So that's the one you want to marry.

TRENTINO
With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and 
Freedonia under my control --
(He rubs his hands 
significantly)

VERA
Maybe it's not going to be so easy.  
From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale 
is rather sweet on this Rufus T. 
Firefly.

TRENTINO
That's where you come in.  I'll leave 
him in your hands, and don't forget 
you're supposed to be my niece.

Vera winks agreeingly.

Mrs. Teasdale enters the scene with Bob Firefly (ZEPPO).

She introduces him.

MRS. TEASDALE
I want you to meet the son of His 
Excellency -- Bob Firefly...

Ambassador Trentino... his niece, Vera, After the formalities 
of introducing, Trentino says:

TRENTINO
Isn't it about time for the ceremony 
to begin, Mrs. Teasdale?
(Mockingly)
I do hope His Excellency won't be 
late.

BOB
(Defensively)
My father makes it a point to always 
be on time.  As long as I've known 
him, he's never been late for an 
appointment.

TRENTINO
But it's two minutes of ten now.

BOB
(As music begins)
His Excellency is due To take his 
station.  Beginning his new 
Administration...  He'll make his 
appearance when The clock on the 
wall strikes ten.

MRS. TEASDALE
(singing)
When the clock on the wall strikes 
ten All you loyal ladies and you 
patriotic men Let's sing the national 
anthem when...  The clock on the 
wall strikes ten.

The clock begins to strike the hour...  one...  two...  
three...  four...

ALL
(singing)
Hail, hail, Freedonia...  Mightiest 
of mighty nations!  Hail, hail, 
Freedonia Land of the brave and free.

This finishes on an operatic note with everybody with 
outstretched hands turned toward the main door that connects 
the reception hall with the outer hall.

Groucho doesn't appear and once more they all sing.

ALL
(singing)
Hail, hail, Freedonia... Land of the 
brave and free.

Again Groucho fails to appear and they all sing once more.

ALL
Hail, hail, Freedonia... Land of the 
brave and free.

Mrs. Teasdale exchanges an apprehensive glance with Bob.  
Vera and Trentino smile.

MRS. TEASDALE
(Nervously)
I hope nothing has happened.

BOB
Mrs. Teasdale, I assure you there is 
nothing to worry about.  Father is 
probably taking extra care in getting 
into his robes of state.  I'll call 
him.

Bob goes over to a corner of the room and pulls a tapestried 
bell cord.  This rings a fire bell in Groucho's room -- and 
Groucho is disclosed asleep in his canopied bed under a 
mosquito netting.  He has an unlighted cigar in his mouth.  
The continued jangling of the fire bell awakens him from his 
slumber and he rises quickly.  The cigar begins to emit smoke 
when he starts puffing.  He hurries over to one corner of 
the room where his clothes are arranged in fireman fashion, 
gets into them, and then sides down a fireman's pole into 
the reception hall.

The guests are singing the last two lines of the national 
anthem when he arrives.

ALL
Hail, hail, Freedonia... Land of the 
brave and free.

Groucho starts across the hall in the direction of Mrs. 
Teasdale.  He passes several notables, one of whom is wearing 
an impressive looking medal.  Groucho deprives him of it 
without stopping his forward movement, and pins it on himself.  
He pauses only when he is facing the principal group.

MRS.  TEASDALE
(Beaming as she 
addresses Groucho)
As chairwoman of the reception 
committee, I welcome you and extend 
the good wishes of every man, woman 
and child of Freedonia.  I deem it 
an honor on this momentous occasion...

GROUCHO
(Interrupting)
Never mind that stuff...

He takes a pack of cards from is pocket and extends them to 
Mrs. Teasdale.

GROUCHO
Take a card.

The bewildered Mrs. Teasdale complies.

Groucho puts the other fifty-one cards in his pocket.

MRS. TEASDALE
What'll I do with this card?

GROUCHO
You can keep it -- I've got a whole 
pack...  Now what were you saying?

MRS.  TEASDALE
As chairwoman of the reception 
committee, I welcome you with open 
arms.

GROUCHO
How late do you stay open?

MRS. TEASDALE
In choosing you, I feel that I serve 
my country well.  I heartily endorse 
everything you stand for.

GROUCHO
Well, I won't stand for much.  And I 
won't stand for you if you don't 
show some improvement soon.  Look at 
your report card last month -- "D" 
in spelling...  six in behavior.  
Now who were the six?  A fine state 
of affairs -- no wonder you can't 
matriculate, now what were you saying?

MRS. TEASDALE
The future of Freedonia rests upon 
you.  Promise me you will follow in 
my husband's footsteps.

GROUCHO
(To CAMERA)
I haven't been on the job five minutes 
and already she's making advances to 
me.
(To Mrs. Teasdale)
Not that I care -- but where is your 
husband?

MRS. TEASDALE
(Slightly embarrassed)
Why - er -- my husband passed away...
(reverently)
I was with him to the very end.

GROUCHO
No wonder he passed away.  I'd like 
to be with you to the very end.  
Can't you see what I'm trying to 
tell you -- I love you.

MRS. TEASDALE
(Very warmly)
Your Excellency!

GROUCHO
You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. 
Teasdale, when I look at you I can 
see that we're facing a crisis.  
We've got to balance the budget -- 
we've got to cut down everything 
including, you.

Ambassador Trentino enters the scene.

MRS.  TEASDALE
Oh...  Your Excellency... I would 
like to present to you... Ambassador 
Verdi Trentino Of Amnesia...  Having 
him with us today is indeed a great 
honor.

TRENTINO
(To Mrs. Teasdale, 
smiling appreciatively)
Thanks... but I can't stay very long.

GROUCHO
That's even a greater honor.

TRENTINO
I bring you the greetings of my 
President and the good will of my 
people.

GROUCHO
I'll keep the greetings -- but you 
can send back the good will... what 
we need right now is twenty million 
dollars.

TRENTINO
Twenty million dollars is a 
considerable sum...  I'll have to 
discuss that with my Minister of 
Finance.

GROUCHO
Well, in the meantime, could you let 
me have $50 personally?

TRENTINO
(Surprised)
$50?

GROUCHO
I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll 
give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.
(Throwing a glance at 
Mrs. Teasdale)
or my jackknife.  If you want my 
advice, you'll take the jackknife...  
I've a better proposition...  Make 
it $25 and I'll give you a first 
mortgage on my son and I hope you 
foreclose.

TRENTINO
(With a puzzled look 
at Groucho)
Your Excellency, haven't we met 
before?

GROUCHO
(Looking at Trentino)
Why yes.  I met you at the dog races -- 
say, you could have won that race if 
you tried a little harder.

Vera Trentino enters scene.

TRENTINO
Excellency, may I present my niece.

GROUCHO
Go ahead.

TRENTINO
You don't understand.  This is my 
niece Vera.

GROUCHO
(Throwing her a glance)
And Vera niece, too.

VERA
Your Excellency, please don't think 
me silly, but I'd love to have a 
picture of you.  I want to hang it 
in my bedroom.

GROUCHO
You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- 
I'll make a note of it.  Where's my 
secretary?
(Looking around)

Bob (ZEPPO) enters scene.

BOB
Here I am, Father.

GROUCHO
(To Bob)
Take a letter.

BOB
(Taking out a 
stenographer's pad 
and pencil)
Who to?

GROUCHO
The President of the United States.

Bob writes as Groucho dictates

GROUCHO
My dear President...  read it back...

BOB
(Reading from pad)
"My dear President"...

GROUCHO
That doesn't sound right...  take 
out "President"...  now read it.

BOB
(Reading)
"My dear"...

GROUCHO
That's not right yet... put back 
"President" and take out "dear"...  
How does it read now?

BOB
(Reading)
"My President"...

GROUCHO
There's still something wrong with 
it... take out "President" ...now 
what've you got?

BOB
(Reading)
"My"...

GROUCHO
Now we're on the right track... Put 
back "dear"... How does it read?

BOB
(Reading)
"My dear"...

GROUCHO
You can't say that to the President...  
Put back "President"... Now let's 
hear how sounds.

BOB
(Reading)
"My dear President"...

GROUCHO
That's what I wanted in the first 
place.  Tear it up and send it 
airmail.

BOB
Is that all?

GROUCHO
Take another letter...  to my tailor.

Bob takes dictation again.

GROUCHO
Dear Sir... enclosed find check for 
$100.  Yours very truly...  Send 
that immediately.

BOB
I'll have to enclose the check first.

GROUCHO
You do and I'll fire you.

Groucho glares over his shoulder at Bob to emphasize his 
remark as the latter exits from the scene.  Mrs. Teasdale 
enters to Groucho.

MRS. TEASDALE
(To Groucho)
Your Excellency, the eyes of the 
world are upon you.  Notables from 
every land are gathered here in your 
honor --
(Indicating the guests 
with a wave of her 
hand)
This is a gala day for us.

GROUCHO
Well, a gal a day is enough for me.  
I couldn't handle any more.

MRS. TEASDALE
If it's not asking too much --
(Recitative)
For our information just for 
illustration
(Begins tune)
Tell us how you intend to run the 
nation.

GROUCHO
(Singing)
These are the laws of my 
administration: No one's allowed to 
smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And 
whistling is forbidden...

ENSEMBLE
(Singing)
We're not allowed to tell a dirty 
joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA

GROUCHO
(Singing)
If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer 
is pursued And in the hoosegow 
hidden...

ENSEMBLE
(Singing)
If we should choose to chew, we'll 
be pursued -

GROUCHO
If any form of pleasure is exhibited 
Report to me and it will be 
prohibited.  I'll put my foot down; 
So shall it be - This is the land of 
the free.  The last man nearly ruined 
this place He didn't know what to do 
with it.  If you think this country's 
bad off now Just wait 'till I get 
through with it.
(Does sailor's hornpipe)
The treasury is low on dough; The 
last man went and flew with it.  If 
you think we're short of money now 
Just wait 'till I get through with 
it.
(Does Highland fling)
The country's taxes must be fixed - 
And I know what to do with it, If 
you think you're paying too much 
now, Just wait 'till I get through 
with it.
(Takes flute from 
inside pocket and 
plays strain of Dixie)

DIGNITARY
(Singing)
In our midst you stand The ruler of 
this land A man who'll govern with 
an iron hand.

GROUCHO
(Singing)
If anyone gets fresh with me, I'll 
show him who's the boss; I'll stand 
upon my dignity, And toss him for a 
loss.  And this will be the penalty
For those who doublecross - We'll 
stand 'em up against the wall, and 
Pop goes the Weasel

ENSEMBLE
(Singing)
If you should make him cross, He'll 
toss you for a loss.  If anyone gets 
fresh with him, He'll show him who's 
the boss.

Groucho does minuet with girls as above is sung

GROUCHO
(Singing)
I will not stand for anything that's 
crooked or unfair; I'm strictly on 
the up and up, So everyone beware.  
If anyone's caught taking graft And 
I don't get my share, we'll stand 
'em up against the wall - and pop 
goes the weasel!

ENSEMBLE
(Singing)
So everyone beware Who's crooked or 
unfair; No one must take a bit of 
graft Unless he gets his share.
(Groucho dances as 
above is sung)

GROUCHO
(Singing)
If any man should come between A 
husband and his bride, We find out 
which one she prefers By letting her 
decide.  If she prefers the other 
man, The husband steps outside; We 
stand him up against the wall And 
Pop goes the Weasel!

ENSEMBLE
(Singing)
The husband steps outside; 
Relinquishes his bride; We stand him 
up against the wall And take him for 
a ride.
(Groucho dances as 
above is sung)

GROUCHO
The population must increase With 
great rapidity.  We give a couple 
seven years To raise a family. If, 
by that time, there is no branch 
Upon the family tree, we stand 'em 
up against the wall - and Pop goes 
the Weasel.

Groucho does a dance with Mrs. Teasdale who joins him 
reluctantly and registers embarrassment as dance continues.  
He might finish dance in her arms, looking tenderly at her 
as she beams down at him.

MRS. TEASDALE
(As she beams on him)
You've made a wonderful impression.  
Your views are liberal... It is easy 
to see you have an open mind.

GROUCHO
That's what I get for dressing in a 
hurry.

MRS. TEASDALE
Your Excellency, you mustn't forget 
your appointment at the House of 
Representatives... Have you got your 
speech ready?

GROUCHO
I wrote a speech last night that'll 
knock them off their seats...
(He takes a paper 
from inside pocket 
as he says above... 
then reads from paper)
Four score and seven years ago, our 
fathers brought forth on this 
continent a new nation --

MRS. TEASDALE
Why, that's the speech that Lincoln 
made at Gettysburg...

GROUCHO
(With a look of great 
surprise)
He did?... I told my son not to leave 
it laying around... Where is son?

Bob enters

BOB
Here I am, Father...

GROUCHO
Send for my car...

BOB
(Calling to servant 
off scene)
His Excellency's car!

This is repeated by a servant's voice off scene...

A servant enters to Groucho, bearing his high silk hat.

He bows low as he hands it to Groucho... Groucho takes hat, 
removes a white rabbit, hands it back to servant, dons his 
hat and with a swanky gesture exits... again we hear a 
servant's voice calling: "His Excellency's car"...

We see the trumpeters at the top of the steps of the mansion, 
outside, standing at attention... their trumpets at their 
sides...

From inside comes the voice of a servant calling "His 
Excellency's car"...

The trumpeters click their heels, draw themselves erect, put 
the trumpets to their mouths and blow a fanfare to summon 
the car...

We cut to the Exterior of the Dictator's garage.  This is a 
pretentious affair.  In central foreground a wall, in the 
center of which is a large wrought-iron double gate.  On 
each side of the gate is a crest or design in relief.  Also 
two liveried guards stand erect before the gate.  A trumpeter 
on the wall above.  Through the gate we see the patio and 
suggestions of the garage.  Two or three high-class cars in 
background identify the garage.

At the beginning of the scene, we hear finish of trumpeter's 
call.  Instantly the two guards move to the center of the 
gates and call through the bars -

GUARDS
(In unison)
His Excellency's car!

Almost instantly there is a terrific roar of motors on the 
other side of the wall.  The two guards open gates moving in 
military manner.  Immediately the gates are wide open, Harpo 
appears on his motorcycle, that carries a side car.

The motorcycle is decorated... perhaps a crest in relief on 
the side of the car...  a thin staff, about four or five 
feet high is fastened to the handle bars...  As Harpo rides 
along, he hoists the Freedonian flag to the staff.  Further 
along the road he hits a man... he looks behind to see what 
damage he's done, but continues riding... A CUT BACK to the 
man shows that he is lying prostrate on the ground.

We CUT BACK to Harpo, who is just getting off motorcycle... 
he takes another look back at the man, lowers the flag to 
half-mast, takes bugle, which is hanging on his car and blows 
a few bars of taps... he mounts motorcycle again and starts 
off...

CUT TO top of mansion steps as Groucho comes from mansion... 
the two guards standing stiffly erect, form a seat by crossing 
hands... Groucho sits on the seat made by their hands, puts 
his arms around their shoulders and they carry him down 
stairs... as fast as they can.

CUT TO Harpo arriving in front of mansion just as Groucho, 
carried by the men, moves into the scene.  Groucho gets into 
the side-car... and in Napoleonic manner says to Harpo:

GROUCHO
To the House of Representatives... 
ride like fury... Don't stop for any 
signals and don't wait for a corner 
to make a turn... see if you can 
break a record...

Harpo takes a phonograph record and smashes it on the 
ground... there is a roar of the motor -- the motorcycle 
starts off but leaves the side-car.

Groucho gets out of side-car... starts back to steps, stops 
and says:

GROUCHO
A fine thing -- leaving the head of 
the nation at the foot of the 
stairs...

As he dashes up the stairs, we CUT TO Harpo... riding along...

A very attractive girl is coming along in the opposite 
direction.  As she approaches Harpo, he toots his horn to 
attract her attention, she throws him a indignant look and 
continues on down the street.  Harpo turns his motorcycle 
around and starts after her.  She looks around, sees Harpo

pursuing and breaks into a run... CUT BACK to Harpo following 
her, putting on speed... he lowers the Freedonian flag and 
simultaneously raises a pirate flag -- with skull and cross-
bones on it, displayed prominently.  A motorcycle cop is 
parked on the corner waiting for prospective violators...  
he sees Harpo chasing the girl and quickly starts his motor 
and follows in pursuit...

The girl, as she reaches the executive mansion, rushes up 
the stairs in an effort to escape.  Harpo comes into the 
scene and rides up the stairs after her... As Harpo gets 
about half way up the stairs the motorcycle cop is seen 
approaching the mansion.

CUT TO reception room of mansion as the girl is running madly 
through the room... a moment later we see Harpo on his bike 
following... there is panic among the guests.  Then we see 
the girl tearing up the stairs leading to the circular 
balcony...

CUT BACK to Harpo.  He looks behind him as he rides and sees 
the motorcycle cop following on his bike.  On the balcony 
above,  the girl is running, with an occasional glance over 
her shoulder as she runs out of scene... Harpo rides into 
scene.  This time he is bent over his handle-bars in the 
manner of a six day bicycle rider... following closely behind 
him rides the motorcycle cop.  They circle the mezzanine... 
Harpo in the lead, looking back now and then over his shoulder 
at his pursuer... this is done in imitation of a six day 
bicycle race... The motorcycle cop is closing in on Harpo... 
the latter approaching a large open door, rides through the 
opening, but the cop continues on around the balcony...  as 
he gets to the opposite side of the circular balcony he passes 
another open doorway.  Harpo comes riding out of it and is 
now in pursuit of the cop...

CUT down stairs to Groucho... One hand is upraised holding a 
gun.  As he looks at a wrist watch, he fires gun, then 
addresses guests looking into CAMERA.

GROUCHO
That concludes the nine o'clock 
sprints... Next Saturday night the 
winner of the six day bicycle race 
will receive ten thousand dollars in 
gold... the following morning we go 
off the gold standard...

CUT BACK to balcony... Harpo is passing the cop...  He holds 
up his hand for the cop to stop... they both come to a halt... 
Harpo gets off his motorcycle, walks over angrily to cop, 
takes out his book, writes out a summons and hands it to the 
cop as we FADE OUT...

END OF SEQUENCE "A"

SEQUENCE "B"

FADE IN on interior of Freedonian House of Representatives.  
This interior although not a replica of our own House of 
Representatives, should be close enough technically to sell 
the idea... Each seat is occupied by an officious-looking 
dignitary.  On the platform are a few desks... perhaps a 
pulpit which Groucho uses when he arrives...  The one to the 
right is the court stenographer's desk, occupied by Bob 
Firefly.  He takes notes as the meeting progresses.

Throughout the House runs a ripple of excitement, which is 
stopped by the rapping of the gavel by the Speaker of the 
House.

SPEAKER
Gentlemen, gentlemen, remember for 
forty-six years we have enjoyed the 
friendship of Amnesia, so ably 
represented by Ambassador Trentino.
(Indicating the 
Ambassador who is 
present)
We owe it to ourselves to listen to 
what he has to say...

Trentino takes the floor

TRENTINO
Gentlemen, while I admit it is unusual 
for a representative of one country 
to advise the legislative body of 
another, I assure you that I have 
the interest of Freedonia at heart 
...
(Deferential applause)
We have lent you money in the past -- 
we are willing to lend you money 
again -- but, we cannot do it if 
your leader is allowed by you, to 
carry out his ridiculous proposals... 
In self-protection it is my --

Bob rises to interrupt

BOB
I object!...  we have no right to 
discuss this matter in the absence 
of my father.

SPEAKER
(To House)
We have been meeting every morning 
for eight days and not once has His 
Excellency been on time...

TRENTINO
(Looking at his watch)
Gentlemen, I cannot wait much 
longer...

SPEAKER
(To Bob)
Would you mind calling your father 
again?

Bob presses a button, either on desk or wall...

CUT TO - the corner of Groucho's bedroom, showing fireman's 
pole.  The sound of the clanging bell is heard over scene.

Groucho hurries into scene, fully clad but for his coat which 
he has on his arm... without waiting to don his coat he slides 
down the pole.  We pick him up finishing the slide down the 
pole into the House of Representatives.  As he arrives the 
members are on their feet singing the last four bars of the 
national anthem.

MEMBERS
(Singing)
HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA Land of the 
brave and free...

Groucho hurries toward Speaker's desk, putting on his coat 
as he goes...  Just as he reaches the desk the singing 
subsides.  Groucho turns to the body of men and looks off in 
the direction of one of the representatives.

GROUCHO
(Pointing toward the 
individual off scene)
The Secretary of Agriculture was a 
little flat...
(He takes a match and 
scratches it across 
the top of the desk 
to light his cigar...  
takes a few puffs, 
then raps the gavel.)
I move we open the morning session...  
Has anybody got a cork screw?
(Looking out and around 
at members)

[page missing]

GROUCHO
What's to stop you from digging one... 
And after you dig a river, how're ya 
gonna cross it without a bridge...?  
We've got to have a bridge to stop 
people from going places -- then 
we've gotta stop them from coming 
back.  If you're worried about the 
expense we can have a bridge with 
only one end -- and if that's a 
success we can do away with it 
altogether. I'm telling you that 
what this country needs is --

Off scene we hear Chico's voice singing "P-E-A-N-U-T-S"... 
this is followed by the piping of a whistle playing the first 
strain of the PEANUT VENDOR...

Groucho listens, annoyed and then continues

GROUCHO
If there's one thing we don't need 
right now -- it's peanuts -- 
gentlemen, what good is a bridge if 
you haven't got ammunition to blow 
it up... ammunition was never 
cheaper...  Right now, you can get 
two cannons for the price of one and 
shoot twice as far for half the 
money...  With every five thousand 
dollar purchase we throw in a Big 
Bertha... If you don't like her, you 
can throw her right out again.  I 
tell you no country can protect itself 
without --

Again Chico's voice comes over scene singing "P-E-A-N-U-T-
S"...  The whistling of the first strain of song - the PEANUT 
VENDOR is heard again

SPEAKER
I'm sorry your Excellency, it is 
that infernal peanut vendor
Chicolini... How can we accomplish 
anything with that constant annoyance?

TRENTINO
Your Excellency - are we or are we 
not going to discuss this problem - 
my time is valuable - I'm a man of 
few words -

GROUCHO
I'm a man of one word... SCRAM!!!

Trentino exits resentfully

GROUCHO
(To Bob - aroused)
Go out and chase that peanut vendor 
away from the building -- Get rid of 
him if you have to use violence - if 
necessary call out the militia and 
if he isn't looking get me a bag of 
peanuts.

BOB
I've tried to chase him but it's no 
use - he won't go -

GROUCHO
He won't eh? - We'll see about that - 
send for your father immediately.

BOB
But you're my father -

GROUCHO
Never mind then, I'll get in touch 
with him myself -

CUT OUTSIDE to Chico standing by his peanut stand which has 
a whistle on it conspicuously displayed -

CHICO
(Singing loudly)
"P-E-A-N-U-T-S"

CLOSE UP of whistle piping tune of "PEANUT VENDOR" - Trentino 
enters to Chico -

CHICO
(To Trentino)
How'm I doing, boss?

TRENTINO
Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything 
you can to disturb Firefly - Now 
what about your cousin?

CHICO
He's working very hard - I got him a 
job driving Firefly's car - He's-a 
driving him crazy and I'm driving 
him nuts - P-E-A-N-U-T-S

Singing even louder than before - Trentino smirks approvingly 
and exits - the whistling of the tune following as we CUT 
inside to Groucho - and the well-known vamp of the "Peanut 
Vendor" is heard coming over scene with orchestra 
accompaniment...

GROUCHO
(Glaring angrily at 
window)
I'll get rid of that pest - watch me --

He walks determinedly in direction of window and breaks into 
a rhumba - with hands on hips - dipping to ground a la Spanish 
dancer... as he reaches window we CUT outside.  Groucho is 
seen in the window - which is on the ground floor - Chico is 
by his peanut stand.

GROUCHO
(To Chico - angrily)
Hey you!!

CHICO
All right -

Chico takes bag of peanuts from stand - throws it to Groucho - 
The latter catches bag and throws Chico a dime - then starts 
to eat the peanuts.

GROUCHO
Have you got a license?

CHICO
No, but my dog he's a got millions 
of them --

GROUCHO
(Munching peanuts as 
Chico walks over and 
stands under window)
What kind of a dog is he?

CHICO
He used to be a bloodhound but he's 
anemic --

GROUCHO
Well - what is he now?

CHICO
He's half poodle and half watch dog -

GROUCHO
Half watch dog?

CHICO
Yeh, he's only got one eye.

GROUCHO
I don't know much about dogs but you 
ought to be on the end of a leash - 
a ninety-nine year leash -
(Gives him a look of 
disgust)
Look - what do you call your dog?

CHICO
I don't call him, I whistle.

GROUCHO
What do you whistle?

CHICO
Yankee Poodle.

GROUCHO
I've got just the place for a man 
like you but I'm too busy right now 
to do any digging.  What do you call 
your dog when you want him?

CHICO
I don't want him.

GROUCHO
Well, if you don't want your dog why 
don't you put him in a pound?

CHICO
He only weighs ten ounces --

GROUCHO
I can use you in the House of 
Representatives.  We need a man who 
understands dogs -- and that's where 
this country is going to.  Step 
inside.

Groucho turns and disappears from the window - CUT INSIDE of 
House of Representatives

GROUCHO
(To Bob)
In case of fire, how long will it 
take to empty this place?

BOB
(After a moment's 
thought)
About - thirty-four seconds.

GROUCHO
We'll start a fire --
(Indicating 
representatives)
-- and get rid of these microbes.

Groucho exits towards door leading into his private office.  
CUT to inside of private office which has another door leading 
to a hallway, and among other articles of furniture, there 
is an impressive-looking desk on which is a telephone.  Just 
as Groucho comes through the door into his office, Chico 
enters through the other door.  He is wearing gauntlets, 
reaching half way up his arms.  As they walk toward each 
other the telephone rings and the two men make a mad  dash 
for the telephone on the desk.  Chico beats Groucho to the 
phone, picks up the receiver.

CHICO
(At telephone)
Hello!...  Yes...  Yes...  He's not 
in...

Chico hangs up receiver and turns to Groucho who is waiting 
impatiently

CHICO
That was for you.

GROUCHO
I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to 
have a long talk with you...  Now 
look here, my good man, you've got 
to stop yelling "peanuts" in front 
of the House of Representatives.

CHICO
Oh no, I can't do it.

GROUCHO
You don't want to be a public 
nuisance, do you?

CHICO
Sure.  How much does the job pay?
(or)
Sure, if there's a chance for 
advancement.

GROUCHO
You wouldn't consider going over 
Niagara Falls without a barrel?

CHICO
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara 
Falls once.

GROUCHO
Did you shoot the rapids?

CHICO
No, but I shot some ducks.

GROUCHO
If there was an open season for 
fellows like you, I'd get myself a 
hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going 
to make you a sporting proposition.  
You give up the peanut stand and 
I'll make you vice-president of the 
country.

CHICO
Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a 
brother who was a vice-president 
once and that's the last we ever 
heard of him.

GROUCHO
Well, maybe he's still the vice-
president.  Now if I were to offer 
you --

Telephone bell rings.  The two men turn and run for the 
telephone.  Again Chico gets there first.  Groucho stands by 
exasperated while Chico talks to the party on the other end 
of the line

CHICO
(To telephone)
Hello...  Yes...  No, not yet... All 
right...  Goodbye.
(Hangs up receiver - 
then says to Groucho)
That was for you again.  He wants 
you to call him up as soon as you 
get back.

GROUCHO
I don't know what's keeping me.  I 
should've been here a long time ago.  
Now how about my proposition?

CHICO
What other job you got?

GROUCHO
Let's see -- What've I got in my 
cabinet besides mice --
(Stops to think - 
then very 
enthusiastically)
I've got it -- how would you like to 
be Secretary of the Interior?

CHICO
That's no good.  I like to work on 
the outside.  I must have something 
easy.

GROUCHO
Then you don't wanna work hard?

CHICO
I don't wanna work at all.

GROUCHO
In that case you'll have to take a 
civil service examination --  if you 
pass I'll put you in the post-office -- 
stick out your tongue.

CHICO
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.

GROUCHO
Well, if you wanna work in the post-
office you'll have to stick out your 
tongue.

CHICO
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I 
gotta have a job where I come to 
work at eleven -- go to lunch at 
twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice 
a year I gotta have a six month 
vacation.

GROUCHO
I've got just the job for you -- 
Secretary of War.

CHICO
'At's-a fine.

Telephone bell rings.  They both make a dash for the 
telephone, but Harpo rushes in through hallway door and 
reaches the phone first.  Harpo picks up through telephone 
receiver, listens to conversation on the other end with an 
occasional nod and shake of the head.  As he listens, he 
scribbles message on a piece of paper.  He holds the written 
message up to the telephone receiver for a moment, then writes 
a few more words on the paper.  During this, Chico and Groucho 
stand by, terribly worried.  Finally Harpo hangs up the 
receiver and exits, tearing up the paper

GROUCHO
(After a moment's 
glance at Harpo)
You know, I'd be lost without a 
telephone.  Now - where were we?  
Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary 
of War.  The first thing you do is 
buy ammunition -- you buy it from me 
and I get 10% commission.

CHICO
What do I get?

GROUCHO
You get half mine and I get half 
yours.

CHICO
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we 
no gotta war.

GROUCHO
Then we've gotta start one. Do you 
know how to start a war?

CHICO
Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult 
somebody.

Groucho suddenly slaps Chico across the face with his gloves, 
then as quickly brings to light a card which he presents to 
Chico in the professional manner of an experienced duelist

GROUCHO
My card.

CHICO
(Laughing)
That's a-no good.  You gotta insult 
somebody from another country.  Look --
(Puts his large gloves 
on the desk)
I come from one country.  You come 
from another country.  I say something 
you don't like.  You say something I 
don't like - and I'm insulted.

GROUCHO
Why wasn't I insulted?

CHICO
You was insulted, but you don't know 
it.

GROUCHO
(Indignantly)
Then I demand an apology!

CHICO
That's a-no good.  If I apologize we 
no got a war.  Look -- I send you a 
scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap 
of paper -- and we have a scrap.

GROUCHO
You've got a brain after all - and 
how you get along without it is 
amazing to me -- Now, who can I 
insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...
(Enthusiastically)
AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?

CHICO
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say 
something to his niece once, and he 
slapped my face.

GROUCHO
Why didn't his niece slap your face?

CHICO
She did.

GROUCHO
What did you say to her?

Chico whispers in Groucho's ear -- Groucho gives him an 
indignant look

GROUCHO
You're lucky I don't slap your face -- 
you oughtta be ashamed of yourself.  
Where did you hear that story?

CHICO
You told it to me.

GROUCHO
(Puzzled for a moment)
Oh, yes, I remember -- and I should 
have slapped Mrs. Teasdale's face 
when she told it to me... I'm going 
right out and find Trentino.  You go 
right out and get yourself an army.

Chico turns to go - Groucho stops him

GROUCHO
Wait a minute.  What kind of an army 
do you think we oughtta have?

CHICO
I think we oughtta have a standing 
army, so we can save money on chairs.

At this point Chico is at the door and exits - Groucho slams 
the door right in his face - then he walks over to the desk 
and sees the larger gauntlets.  He takes a swing with his 
own gloves, then takes a hefty swing with the gauntlet.  He 
leaves his own gloves on the desk and exits with the gauntlets 
in is hand.

CUT outside.  Harpo is just pulling up to the curb in front 
of the House of Representatives, in his motorcycle and side 
car.  Groucho comes from the building wearing gauntlets, 
gets into the side car and with a dignified wave of his hand, 
says:

GROUCHO
To Mrs. Teasdale's residence!

The motorcycle speeds out of the scene, leaving the side car 
behind.

GROUCHO
This is the fifth trip I've made 
today and I haven't been anywhere 
yet.

And, as he gets out of the side car and starts to go back 
into the building, the scene

FADES OUT

END OF SEQUENCE "B"

SEQUENCE "C"

FADE IN to garden party.  This is an afternoon tea in the 
garden of the Teasdale estate.   Spotted in the set-up are 
innumerable colorful umbrellas, under which are tea tables.

The guests include the notables we saw in the mansion in the 
first sequence.  The only two people absent are Ambassador 
Trentino and Mrs. Teasdale.  Vera Trentino is seated at one 
of the tables and her presence is established there in the 
opening shot.  Music is heard over the scene and should be 
continued through the scene as if being played by an orchestra 
on the premises.  Suddenly the chatter ceases as the following 
announcement is heard coming over scene.

GUARD'S VOICE
(From off scene)
His Excellency, Rufus T. Firefly!

All eyes turn toward those off scene and everyone rises to 
sing the last four bars of the national anthem.

Cut to the gateway leading into the garden... a servant on 
each side of the gate, as Groucho jauntily strides through 
the gate, swinging the unusually large gauntlets...

GUESTS
(Singing)
HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA Land of the 
brave and free...

Groucho hands his high silk hat to one of the guards and 
starts down the walk among the guests.  From his attitude it 
is evident that he is intent on finding Ambassador Trentino.  
Suddenly he stops, having seen something of interest off 
scene.  The following dialogue comes over the scene.

TRENTINO'S VOICE
Can't you see, Gloria, our marriage 
would not only unite two great 
families...

CUT TO Trentino and Mrs. Teasdale in a quiet corner of the 
garden -- both are at a tea table.  This shot leaves Groucho 
out.

TRENTINO
(Continuing)
...but would further cement the 
relations of our countries.

MRS. TEASDALE
(Fluttering with 
excitement)
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed 
honored...
(Falteringly)
But you see - well - I --

TRENTINO
(Repressing his anger - 
coldly)
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?

MRS. TEASDALE
Well no -- not exactly -- but --

TRENTINO
(Impatiently)
Gloria -- I've waited for years.  I 
won't be put off!  I love you!  I 
want you!
(Taking her hand 
pleadingly)
Can't you see that I'm at your feet?

Groucho enters the scene.

GROUCHO
(To Trentino)
When you get through with her feet, 
you can start on mine.  I haven't 
been to a chiropodist in two years...
(To CAMERA)
If that's not an insult, I don't 
know what is.
(Turns to Gloria)
Gloria, I love you.  I --

TRENTINO
(Furious, to Gloria)
Can't we go some place where we can 
be alone?

GROUCHO
(To Mrs. Teasdale)
What can this mug offer you?  Wealth 
and family.  I can't give you 
wealth...
(Archly lifting his 
eyebrow)
...but we can have a little family 
of our own.

MRS. TEASDALE
(Coyly)
Oh, Rufus!

GROUCHO
All I can offer you is a Rufus over 
your head.

MRS. TEASDALE
(Happily confused)
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know 
what to say.

GROUCHO
I wouldn't know what to say either 
if I was in your place.
(Turning to Trentino)
Maybe you can suggest something.

TRENTINO
(Hotly)
This has gone far enough!  This 
interruption is humiliating, to say 
the least...

GROUCHO
Well, why not say the least and get 
it over with?

MRS. TEASDALE
(Fearful)
Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!

TRENTINO
(Half addressing Mrs. 
Teasdale)
I didn't come here to be insulted.

GROUCHO
That's what you think.

TRENTINO
(Furiously)
You swine!

GROUCHO
Give me that again!

TRENTINO
You worm!

GROUCHO
Once more!
(Holds his gauntlets 
in his hand, ready 
at any moment to 
strike)

TRENTINO
You upstart!

GROUCHO
That's it!  No man lives who can 
call a Firefly an upstart.

Without further ado, Groucho strikes Trentino across the 
face with his gauntlets.  Then he quickly flashes his card 
and extends it to Trentino in the manner of a duelist.

GROUCHO
(As he offers the 
card)
Touch.

A sudden ripple of excitement as the guests, attracted by 
the rumpus begin to move into the scene.  Prominent among 
these is Vera Trentino.  Trentino refuses Groucho's card, 
white with rage.

TRENTINO
(Coldly)
I shall report this indignity the my 
President.
(To Mrs. Teasdale - 
polite but firm)
Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this 
regrettable occurrence will plunge 
our countries into war.

MRS. TEASDALE
(Half crying)
This is terrible!

VERA
Uncle, you can't do this!

TRENTINO
(Politely)
My dear niece -- I must ask you not 
to interfere.  War is not a woman's 
problem.

VERA
(Rising angrily)
It is every woman's problem.  Who 
supplies the sons? -- the brothers? -- 
the husbands?  Who...

GROUCHO
(To Vera -- 
interrupting)
You keep that up and you'll crab the 
whole war.

VERA
Carry out this tragic folly if you 
will -- But I for one will not be a 
part of it.
(She winks at Trentino)
I will stay here in Freedonia.

TRENTINO
(As a faint smile of 
understanding vanishes 
from his face)
Very well then, if that's how you 
feel about it --
(suggestive shrug of 
his shoulders)
My country has spoken.

He turns on his heel as if about to leave.  Groucho stops 
him

GROUCHO
Then it's war?

TRENTINO
(Stiffly)
Yes.

GROUCHO
How're ya fixed for ammunition?

TRENTINO
Bah!!
(Waves Groucho aside 
and exits)

GROUCHO
(Dramatically)
THEN IT'S WAR!

SOUND of trumpet - Ta - ta - ta-ta

GROUCHO
THEN IT'S WAR!

SOUND of trumpet - Ta - ta - ta-ta

GROUCHO
GATHER THE FORCES!

SOUND of trumpet - Ta - ta - ta - ta

GROUCHO
HARNESS THE HORSES!

SOUND of trumpet - Ta - ta - ta - ta

GROUCHO
THEN IT'S WAR!

The above lies are spoken in meter and each line is punctuated 
by the staccato notes of the trumpet.  Groucho makes a 
military exit from scene in time to the music, which goes 
into a military march.  As Groucho reaches the gate, the 
guard hands him his high silk hat.  Groucho takes the hat -- 
removes a white rabbit from it  -- hands it to the guard -- 
as he exits through gate.

DISSOLVE.

END OF SEQUENCE "C"

SEQUENCE "D"

INSERT of newspaper.  The newspaper moves up to CAMERA from 
background -- as it stops we read the following headlines:

"ARMIES MOBILIZE AS WAR CLOUDS GATHER!"

Through this insert we get the vague impression of war 
activity.  We see the movement of soldiers' feet.  From the 
background the second insert moves up to CAMERA...

The first insert moves past CAMERA and the second insert 
comes from the background.  The headline reads:

"AMNESIA HASTENS PREPARATIONS!"

Through this insert we see the heavy wheels of army wagons 
moving along.  This is replaced by the the insert coming 
from the background.  The headlines read -

"FREEDONIA'S LEADER MAINTAINS ATTITUDE OF DIGNIFIED SILENCE!"

Bombing planes move through this insert.  The front page of 
the paper is turned and followed by a few other pages until 
we come to the classified ad section of the paper.  We see 
the following advertisement:

WANTED: - A female spy.

Must be young and attractive Apply to Office of Secretary of 
War.

Above this ad we just see a few lines of another ad --

WANTED: -- A Chauffeur Below the war nurse ad we see part of 
another ad in which a cook is wanted.

DISSOLVE TO

A SHOT (in movement) of a row of shapely legs, obviously 
those of very pretty girls.  The CAMERA moves upward 
disclosing the faces of the girls, who are sitting in a row 
in the ante-room of the Secretary of War's office.  On the 
door leading to the Secretary's private office, we see the 
lettering: PRIVATE.  The CAMERA discloses only four or five 
of these girls, but we know there are more in the room.  Bob 
appears in the doorway leading to the Secretary's office and 
addresses the first girl - nearest the door.

BOB
The Secretary of War will see you 
next, Miss.

This girl is very pretty and has a very attractive form.

She smiles at Bob, rises and exits into the Secretary's 
office.  Bob closes the door behind her.  The CAMERA now 
moves along the row of girls and the sixth or seventh girl 
in the row is Harpo, dressed as a girl.  On the other side 
of him are more girls.  A girl to the right of him turns to 
the girl beside her.

GIRL
(To the girl at her 
right)
Did you hear the one about the woman 
taking a bath?... Well, she forgot 
to lock the door... A man came in 
and said, "I'm a doctor"... The woman 
said, "I'm not sick"... and the man 
said, "that's all right.  I'm not a 
doctor."

All of the girls laugh heartily at at this remark.

Harpo is laughing also.  He slaps the story-teller on the 
leg.

Her laughter ceases instantly.  She slaps him back, and gets 
another slap on the leg in return.  A little squeal of pain 
from her and she raises her dress disclosing a bruise on her 
leg just above the knee.

GIRL
(To Harpo)
Look!

Harpo does so, then pulls up his own dress and points to his 
leg for her to look.  On his leg is tattooed a picture of 
two hearts entwined with an arrow running through both.  She 
gives Harpo dirty look and rises

CUT TO

Private office of Secretary of War.  The office is cluttered 
with war implements, maps, etc.  The examination of the girl 
is in progress.  She is turning around in the manner of a 
clothes model.  Chico is looking her over.

CHICO
(To girl)
You look pretty good to me - but 
very still need a spy - Have you got 
any credentials?

The girl nods and pulls her dress up above her knees revealing 
an attractive leg.  She reaches into her stocking for a paper.

CHICO
(Taking a very good 
look)
You got credentials all right.

The girl drops her skirt and hands the paper to Chico.  Chico 
looks at the paper

CHICO
This is fine.  Put it back.

Hands the girl the paper.  She lifts her dress above her 
knees again and puts the paper back in her stocking, while 
Chico looks on.  She drops her skirt.

CHICO
I think I better take another look 
at that paper...

She lifts the skirt again to get the paper, while Chico steals 
another glance.  The girl drops her skirt and hands him the 
paper.

CHICO
(Looking at the paper)
I look this over later -- now I look 
you over.  If you want to be a spy, 
you gotta be in good condition.  I 
better examine you.

He takes stethoscope from his pocket, applies it to her heart 
and listens.

CHICO
(Listening to girl's 
heart beat)
There's something wrong -- I think 
I'm getting Whiteman's band.

Puts stethoscope back in his pocket and takes watch from 
vest pocket.  He feels her pulse while looking at the watch.

CHICO
According to my watch it's four 
o'clock.
(Puts watch back in 
his pocket)
Now look -- a woman spy is a-gotta 
make love to men.  Come on -- let's 
see you make love...

She walks over to him and lovingly strokes his hair, puts 
both arms around him, then suddenly becomes very amorous, 
bends him over and kisses him madly.  She lets go after a 
little while and Chico comes up for air.  He staggers around 
in a daze.  Then he takes the watch from his vest pocket, 
hands it to her, extends his wrist and says:

CHICO
Now you feel my pulse.

Suddenly the screaming of girls is heard coming from the 
anteroom, and we cut to the anteroom in the midst of 
confusion.  The girls are running helter-skelter, one or two 
of them are standing on chairs with their skirts lifted above 
their knees.  There is a little white mouse running about 
the room.

Harpo is sitting innocently on the bench.  The girl just 
interviewed by Chico comes from the office, sees the mouse, 
screams and joins in the general confusion.  Groucho enters 
as the girls are running about - zig-zags among them and 
continues through the room into the private office of Chico - 
closing door behind him. The girls clear out of anteroom and 
Harpo is left all alone.  He takes a small mouse trap from 
his large pocketbook, puts it on the floor, crouches down 
and whistles to the mouse in the manner of a man trying to 
call a dog.  The mouse in answer to the whistle runs into 
the trap.

CUT TO

The Secretary of War's office.  Chico at the phone.

CHICO
(To phone)
Send in the next girl.
(He hangs receiver up)

GROUCHO
By the way, are you sure we need a 
spy?

CHICO
Sure, we gotta have a spy.  If we no 
got a spy who's gonna tell the other 
side what we're doing?

At this point, Harpo makes his entrance through the door, 
carrying his unusually large pocketbook which is about the 
size of a carpetbag.   He walks past Groucho in a seductive 
manner, swinging his bag and rolling his eyes flirtatiously.  
Groucho is delighted with this action and returns the ogling.

CHICO
(To Harpo)
Have you got any credentials?

Harpo lifts his dress and shows them the tattoo on his leg 
of the two hearts.  Groucho examines it closely.

GROUCHO
I don't go in much for modern art.  
Have you got anything by one of the 
old masters?

Harpo lifts his dress above the other leg and shows a picture 
of Gainsborough's "Blue Boy".  Chico and Groucho arise from 
the examination.

GROUCHO
I'm glad I didn't ask you for 
"Washington Crossing the Delaware".

CHICO
(To Harpo)
We've gotta have somebody who knows 
how to get secrets from men.  You 
know how to make love?

Harpo walks over to Chico, throws his arms around him and 
starts to give him a big hug. He squeezes him very hard.  In 
the midst of this there is a loud report.

A startled look from Groucho and Chico.  We see that Harpo 
is minus one breast.  He tries to affect an innocent look 
when suddenly there is a second loud report and his breasts 
are now as flat as a billiard table.

Just as he turns to hide the sight from Chico and Groucho, a 
hissing sound is heard -- the air is leaking out of his bustle 
and the bustle is becoming deflated.)

GROUCHO
(To Harpo)
You ought to carry a spare.

Harpo goes to a corner of the room and keeps his back to 
CAMERA.  He takes a tube out of his dress front and begins 
to blow.  Chico and Groucho wear a puzzled look as they watch 
him - the bustle starts to expand.

This inflation continues to gigantic proportions as they 
look on.

GROUCHO
(Looking at Harpo)
We're certainly living in a marvelous 
age.

There is a terrific explosion and all of Harpo's clothes are 
blown off him - leaving him in nothing but running pants and 
ladies' silk stockings.  His body is literally covered with 
tattoos.

CHICO
(Laughing)
That's very funny... he certainly 
fooled me.  He'll make a good spy.

Winks significantly at Harpo.  Harpo returns the wink.

GROUCHO
(Examining tattoos)
If we can't use him as a spy, we can 
have him framed.

He and Chico continue further examination of the tattooed 
designs on Harpo's body.

CHICO
Say, that's a nice collection.  You 
oughta have a catalogue.

Harpo pulls a catalogue from under the belt of his trunks 
and hands it to Chico.  Groucho and Chico look at the 
catalogue.

GROUCHO
Let's take a look at number eighteen.

Harpo reveals more of his back and shows a superb tattooed 
job of a beautiful girl's head.

CHICO
(Referring to picture 
of girl)
Say, she's all right.  You got-a her 
phone number?

Harpo raises one arm and shows the phone number tattooed 
right under the arm pit.  He holds this a moment, then turns 
and discloses a portion of the tattooing on his chest.  
Groucho and Chico's eyes shift from the telephone number to 
the tattooed picture on his chest.  Harpo completes move and 
discloses the entire picture.  It is a country back-house 
with a crescent over the door.  Chico laughs uproariously.

CHICO
(Laughing)
That's a funny one!

He slaps Harpo an the back good-naturedly.

TRICK SHOT on HARPO'S CHEST.  The door in the outhouse flies 
open.  The head of a real man appears in the opening.  He 
looks off in the direction of Chico and mumbles incoherencies 
under his breath.

He is terribly angry at being interrupted.  He draws in his 
head, closing the door behind him.

CHICO
(To Harpo)
I think we can use you.  Here's a 
spy glass... go ahead and do some 
spying...

Harpo takes the glasses and goes directly toward the window.  
As he looks across street through binoculars, he is grinning 
all over and wiggling around like a happy kid.

ROOM ACROSS THE STREET

Looking into the open window of a bedroom as Harpo would see 
it through the binoculars.  A beautiful girl is undressing, 
preparing to retire.  After a moment of this shot CUT BACK 
to Harpo looking through the binoculars.  Chico takes the 
binoculars from Harpo and pushes him out of the scene, 
proceeds to look himself.  He registers the same satisfaction 
as Harpo and hands the binoculars to Groucho.  As Groucho 
looks through the binoculars at the beautiful girl, Chico 
says:

CHICO
He's going to make a good spy... 
that's not bad for the first day.

GROUCHO
(Turning and looking 
at Chico)
That's not bad for any day.

Groucho takes a second look through the binoculars at the 
beautiful girl.  This time he sees Harpo chasing the girl 
around the roam.  This is shot through the binoculars as 
before.  Groucho registers amazement as he looks through 
binoculars; perhaps squints his eyes once or twice and takes 
second look.

GROUCHO
(To Chico)
Maybe my eyes are bad - you take a 
look.

Chico takes the binoculars and looks at the room across the 
street.  Binocular shot as before.  The girl is in her 
underwear, tearing out of the room into the hall, pursued by 
Harpo.  Chico is still looking through the binoculars.

GROUCHO
You're right about that guy -- I 
think we've got something.

CHICO
I don't know about us, but I know 
he's-a got something...

CUT TO the front of the building occupied by the beautiful 
girl.  She comes dashing madly out of the door and starts 
down the street, clad only in her underwear.  Harpo appears 
in doorway, riding his motorcycle and starts down the street 
after her.

FADE OUT

END OF SEQUENCE "D"

SEQUENCE "E"

FADE IN to living room of Mrs. Teasdale's home...  It is a 
smartly appointed room.  Its main feature for our purposes 
is a winding stairway leading to bedrooms above.

In the absence of Mrs. Teasdale, Vera is seated by fireplace 
while Ambassador Trentino is excitedly pacing up and down...

TRENTINO
This is all Firefly's fault -- that 
idiot, that fool...

VERA
I thought everything was working out 
fine.

TRENTINO
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war...  
My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale 
and overthrow Firefly.

VERA
Maybe you can still win the old dame 
over -- why not try to --

At this point Trentino sees Mrs. Teasdale coming downstairs 
and hushes Vera with a nudge.

MRS. TEASDALE
(As she descends stairs)
I'm so sorry I've kept you waiting...

Trentino walks over to meet her.

TRENTINO
(Taking her hand)
Mrs. Teasdale...
(Kisses her hand)
I deeply regret the unfortunate affair 
with his Excellency, but his attitude 
left me no alternative...

MRS.  TEASDALE
(Emotionally)
To think that this should happen 
after all these years of friendship.

VERA
Maybe the war can still be averted...

MRS. TEASDALE
(Hopefully)
Oh, if only it could...

TRENTINO
Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket 
my pride and do anything I can to 
make up with his Excellency.

MRS. TEASDALE
(Solicitously)
Oh, would you...?

TRENTINO
For you, I would do anything...
(Bowing graciously)

VERA
If only we can get his Excellency to 
listen to reason...

TRENTINO
(To Mrs. Teasdale)
Perhaps he will listen to you...

MRS.  TEASDALE
Perhaps...  I'll call him...

She goes the phone... as she starts to dial the number there 
is a quick CUT to Trentino and Vera who are exchanging 
significant looks...

CUT BACK to Mrs. Teasdale at phone...

MRS. TEASDALE
(Talking into phone)
Hello, your Excellency?...  I hate 
to disturb you -- I know you're a 
very busy man, but I must see you at 
once.

CUT TO Groucho at other end of telephone...  He is lying in 
bed, in his flannel nightgown, eating crackers...  the bed 
is strewn with cracker boxes and crackers...

GROUCHO
(Into phone)
Why not come over here? -- You can 
come in the back way and no one'll 
see you...

CUT BACK to Mrs. Teasdale at phone.

MRS. TEASDALE
(Into phone)
But your Excellency, you must -- oh 
thank you -- please hurry...
(She hangs up phone... 
and walks over to 
her guests)
He'll be right over...

CUT TO corner of room (Mrs. Teasdale's living room), 
disclosing for the first time the fireman's pole... Groucho 
comes sliding down the pole in his nightgown, with a long 
box of crackers under his arm... stops about three feet from 
the floor, looks around the room and sees Trentino.

GROUCHO
(Hanging on to pole -- 
addressing Trentino)
If I knew you were here I would've 
brought some cheese...

He shoots right up the pole again out of sight.  Hold CAMERA 
on this shot for an instant...  Groucho comes sliding down 
again... this time he is fully dressed, including his high 
hat and the cigar in s mouth...  He walks over to Trentino 
belligerently, and deposits his hat on table on the way.

GROUCHO
(To Trentino)
So -- you've come to ask for clemency!  
I'll give the enemy no quarter -- 
not a dime...

MRS. TEASDALE
But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador 
is here on a friendly visit...  He 
came to ask you to patch up the 
breach.

GROUCHO
Let him patch up his own breeches...

TRENTINO
(To Groucho -- ignoring 
Groucho's remark)
I'm sorry we lost our tempers...  
I'm willing to forget if you are.

GROUCHO
Forget?
(Like an injured woman)
You ask me to forget... Why, my 
ancestors would rise from their 
graves... and I'd only have to bury 
them again... A Firefly never 
forgets...

TRENTINO
I am willing to apologize...  I'm 
willing to do anything to prevent 
this war.

GROUCHO
Nothing doing!!  I've taken a lease 
on the battlefield.  I'd lose my 
deposit, besides, I've already ordered 
the ammunition...

VERA
(Putting her arms 
around Groucho)
Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there 
something I can do?

GROUCHO
Yes, but I'll talk to you about that 
when we're alone...

MRS. TEASDALE
(Coming to Groucho)
Oh, won't you reconsider...

GROUCHO
(Relenting)
Well, maybe I am a little 
headstrong...  But, you know, it's 
awfully hard to forget what he called 
me.
(Indicating Trentino)

TRENTINO
What I called you...  Why, what did 
I call you?

GROUCHO
I don't remember.

TRENTINO
(With a little chuckle)
Oh -- you mean... worm?

GROUCHO
(Smiling coyly)
No, that wasn't it...

TRENTINO
Was it -- swine?

GROUCHO
(Same attitude as 
above)
No... it was a seven letter word.

TRENTINO
(Thinking, then with 
a broad smile)
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!

GROUCHO
That's it...

Takes gloves from Trentino's breast pocket and socks him 
across the face... and puts them in his own breast pocket.  
Trentino becomes apoplectic

TRENTINO
(Spluttering and 
stuttering)
Why - er - Mrs. Teasdale - this is 
an outrage!  This man is impossible...  
My course is clear...  this means 
war...
(Turns to go and turns 
and yells to Groucho)
You RUNT!

GROUCHO
I still like UPSTART the best.

Trentino exits in a rage.  Vera pretends that she is overcome 
by the scene

VERA
(Putting her hand to 
her brow)
Oh, this is dreadful!  If you'll 
excuse me I'll go to my room...

She exits toward stairway

MRS.  TEASDALE
(Excited - almost 
hysterical)
Yes, it's awful!
(To Groucho)
Are you sure you did the right thing?

GROUCHO
Of course.  Who ever heard of calling 
off a war after ordering all the 
ammunition?

By this tine Vera has descended the stairs and exited from 
scene.  Groucho looks around the room furtively to make sure 
he is not being observed and takes a large envelope from his 
inside pocket.

GROUCHO
The plans of war are in this envelope.  
I want you to take care of them -- 
no one will ever suspect you.

He hands papers to her

CUT TO Vera lingering on stairs looking down on the scene 
below.  Having heard the conversation, she exits from scene, 
and we CUT down stairs to Groucho and Mrs. Teasdale.

GROUCHO
Guard them with your life... don't 
leave them out of your sight...  If 
the enemy gets those papers  we're 
lost.  If they don't get them, we're 
lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying 
to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. 
Teasdale, you're the salt of the 
earth.  They don't come any better 
than you...

MRS. TEASDALE
(Modestly, with a 
bashful lowering of 
her eyes)
Now -- er --

GROUCHO
Well -- they might come better but 
they don't come any bigger... and 
the bigger the better.  The bigger 
the betta you've got on a horse, the 
more you lose, and speaking about 
horses, why don't you marry me.  
Come, come -- say yes and you'll 
never see me again.  I'll go 'way if 
it means your happiness...

MRS. TEASDALE
Oh, your Excellency, you take me off 
my feet.

Groucho puts his arms around her and tries unsuccessfully to 
lift her off her feet.

GROUCHO
(Angrily)
Swell chance I've got taking you off 
your feet...

Mrs. Teasdale sinks down into a chair; without hesitation, 
Groucho slides into her lap and continues his passionate 
love making.

GROUCHO
Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?

MRS. TEASDALE
Why -- why -- of course.

GROUCHO
You can call me Gloria too.  Gloria -- 
what a beautiful name.  When I was 
born my mother named me Gloria -- 
two minutes later she found out her 
mistake...

CUT TO door as Bob enters.  He moves in the direction of 
Groucho and Mrs. Teasdale.

BOB
(Coming into scene)
Father...

GROUCHO
(Looks up and sees 
Bob... without being 
a bit disturbed... 
remains on her lap)
Take a letter...

Bob takes out pad and pencil.

BOB
Who to?

GROUCHO
None of your business...  Take another 
letter.

Groucho rises to his feet and paces the floor in the manner 
of a studious business man with his hands behind his back... 
then starts to dictate as Bob writes on his pad.

GROUCHO
Eureka Ammunition Company -- Gentlemen -- 
Your shipment of sailor hats arrived 
this morning by freight --
(Turns to Mrs. Teasdale)
Gloria, I could go for you in a big 
way --
(turns to Bob)
However, the rifles you sent were a 
little rusty --
(Then to Mrs. Teasdale)
-- and I don't say that to everybody --
(Now to Bob)
Have not received last month's drawing 
account.  How come?
(To Mrs. Teasdale)
Your neck is like a swan...  Yours 
very truly.  Now read it back.
(Dashes back to Mrs. 
Teasdale's lap)

BOB
(Reading from pad)
Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen.  
Your shipment of sailor hats arrived 
this morning by freight.  Gloria, I 
could go for you in a big way.  
However, the rifles you sent were a 
little rusty and I don't say that to 
everybody.  Have not received last 
month's drawing account; how come 
your neck is like a swan.  Yours 
very truly...

GROUCHO
(Rising to his feet)
They'll know I mean business then 
they get that letter...  see that 
that gets out immediately and that 
goes for you too.

BOB
Yes, sir.
(Exits from scene)

GROUCHO
(Turning to Mrs.  
Teasdale)
Gloria, much as I hate to leave, I'd 
be crazy to stay here.

MRS. TEASDALE
Well, if you must go --

She picks up Groucho's hat and hands it to him.  He removes 
a white rabbit from hat and gives it to her.  He is about to 
put the hat on his head when something in the hat attracts 
his attention.  He empties six baby rabbits out of the hat 
onto the table; puts his hat on and exits.

CUT TO outside of house just as Harpo is pulling up to the 
curb in his motorcycle and sidecar.  Groucho comes out of 
house and walks directly to motorcycle.

GROUCHO
(To Harpo)
I'm not taking any more chances.  
You sit in the sidecar...

Harpo gets off seat and sits in sidecar.  Groucho sits on 
driver's seat.  The sound of the motor is heard and Harpo 
drives off in the sidecar, leaving Groucho on the motorcycle.

FADE OUT

END OF SEQUENCE "E"

SEQUENCE "F"

FADE INTO

Insert of program

GEMS FROM THE OPERAS

PREMIER DANSEUSE

VERA TRENTINO

DISSOLVE - Through program to stage of opera house - company 
singing aria from some well-known opera.  CUT TO orchestra 
box nearest proscenium arch.  Harpo and Chico are there fast 
asleep leaning on each other.  They are dressed in Inverness 
capes - wearing their high hats.  Chico has a red band across 
his shirt-front on which is embossed "Secretary of War" in 
gold letters.  An usher enters box with two people in the 
background.

USHER
(To Chico and Harpo)
I'm sorry gentlemen - but you have 
the wrong seats.

CHICO
(Awakening)
That's all right.  We're not enjoying 
ourselves anyway.

USHER
You belong in that box over there -
(Pointing to vacant 
box on opposite side 
of house - orchestra 
box)

CHICO
(To Harpo)
Come on --

They both step out of box, onto stage and stroll casually 
across as singing is going on.  Part of the way across, Harpo 
and Chico react to the singing of a very high note -- it's 
practically in Harpo's ear.  He stops -- makes a terrible 
face -- takes out ear-muffs, puts them on his ears and he 
and Chico continue toward the box --

CUT TO other box -- the one that Chico and Harpo are headed 
for.  Mrs. Teasdale and guests are being ushered in...

Chico and Harpo come into scene, arriving at box.  Chico 
steps into box from stage.  Harpo is about to follow when he 
spies a pretty girl in box above.  He starts climbing up the 
proscenium arch to upper box -- the girl sees him, screams 
and dashes out of box.  Harpo completes climb into box -- at 
this point the singing has just finished and applause breaks 
out.

Harpo acknowledges the applause as if it was in appreciation 
of his climb -- after a few quick bows he starts out of the 
box after the girl.  As he is running out of box into the 
foyer he bumps into Ambassador Trentino.

TRENTINO
(Stopping him)
Wait a minute... Mrs. Teasdale is in 
the box below.  The plans of war are 
in her purse -- you've got to get 
them -- I don't care how, but get 
them -- and when you do, bring them 
to 492 North Myrtle Road -- you'd 
better write that down.

Harpo takes out a pencil with heavy lead and writes the 
address on the white and purple-edged silk band which is 
across Trentino's shirt bosom.  Then he pushes Trentino's 
coat aside and from under his vest pulls the ribbon in the 
manner of a ticker tape -- tears it off -- and starts back 
to box.

CUT TO

LOWER BOX

MRS. TEASDALE
I wonder what's keeping His 
Excellency?

CHICO
Never mind His Excellency -- you 
gotta your pocketbook?

MRS. TEASDALE
Yes -- why?

CHICO
I wanna powder my nose...

Mrs. Teasdale laughs good-naturedly and puts the purse behind 
her between her back and the back of the chair...  as we go 
to stage where the shooting of the apple in "William Tell" 
is being enacted.  William Tell is just placing the apple on 
his son's head -- he turns his back on his son and walks 
toward opposite side of stage with bow and arrow.

CUT TO

UPPER BOX

Harpo takes a look at apple on the boy's head -- reaches 
down in box and comes up with a bow and arrow.  He takes a 
good aim and lets the arrow fly...  It hits its mark and the 
apple falls to the ground.  William Tell, having arrived at 
spot from which he's going to shoot, turns to take aim and 
sees that the apple is gone.  He picks up another, at the 
base of an apple tree and starts in direction of his son.

CUT TO Harpo, who is watching William Tell.  He reaches down 
into box and brings up another arrow -- takes aim and lets 
arrow fly.  Again it hits its mark and the apple falls to 
ground.  William Tell, reaching his place, turns to take aim 
and is bewildered at the sight of the second missing apple.  
The tree is bare and there are no more apples around.

A whistle is heard coming over scene.  William Tell turns in 
direction of the whistle and we CUT TO Harpo whistling with 
his fingers in his mouth.  Reaching down into the box, he 
brings up a bag of apples and dumps all the apples onto the 
stage.  CUT TO:  Lower box.

MRS.  TEASDALE
(Anxiously)
If his Excellency doesn't get here 
soon, he'll miss the whole 
performance.

CHICO
He's-a not missing anything.  He's 
in the dressing room with Vera 
Trentino.
(Winks at her)

MRS. TEASDALE
(Jealously)
In her dressing room?  Why, what 
could he be doing there?

CHICO
He could be playing solitaire, but I 
don't think so.

She jumps as if she's been goosed, and gives Chico an 
indignant look as he withdraws his hand from her back.

MRS. TEASDALE
What's the matter with you?

CHICO
What's the matter with you?

MRS. TEASDALE
You haven't been still a moment since 
you've been here.  You act as if you 
had neurosis --

CHICO
I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's-
a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta 
new-rosis.

Mrs. Teasdale looks at him disdainfully, turns to look at 
stage, and jumps again.  She and Chico turn to look at each 
other.  She, of course, is indignant, while Chico smiles -- 
his hand is coming from behind her.  She takes the purse 
from its hiding place and places it on the ledge of the box 
out of Chico's reach.  CUT TO:

Ballet dancers' dressing room. The CAMERA PANS along, showing 
several of the ballet dancers limbered up by other dancers.

This is done as follows: - a girl stands against the wall on 
one leg while another girl raises the other leg up and down.

The CAMERA passes three or four of the girls and comes to a 
stop on Vera and Groucho -- the latter is stretching her leg 
in the same manner.

VERA
(With exaggerated 
romance)
I shall dance for you tonight as 
I've never danced before.

GROUCHO
This is a fine thing to be doing at 
my age.

VERA
Are you getting tired?

GROUCHO
(Still working leg)
Not at all.  When I was a boy back 
on the farm I used to pump my own 
water.

CUT TO shot taking in the stage and Harpo.  Harpo is in the 
foreground.  On the stage is our hero and his valet.

VALET
(Singing to hero)
Your love is waiting for you, my 
lord...

HERO
Fetch my hat - my hat - my hat --

Harpo tosses him a large hat - possibly a fireman's hat.

HERO
(Continuing singing)
Fetch my boots --
(Harpo throws boots 
on stage Hero 
continues)
Bring me my sword --
(Harpo throws a sword 
on stage --)

Hero continues his song while Harpo litters the stage with 
various articles - a saddle - a chair, etc...

CUT TO box below - Chico is trying to reach for pocketbook 
on ledge but can't get it.  He whistles up to Harpo.  Harpo 
looks down and Chico pantomimes to him to get the pocketbook, 
pointing to it.  The singing stops and aplause follows -- 
the orchestra starts a selection -- which continues through 
following routine without any singing.

CUT TO box above.  Harpo takes out a fishing pole with a 
reel on it -- he unwinds reel and the line descends

near box below and lands in a man's hair -- the man occupies 
an aisle seat in the orchestra -- near Teasdale box.

CUT TO Harpo reeling in.  CUT TO man on aisle seat -- The 
hook has caught onto his toupe and its being pulled off his 
head.  CUT TO Harpo reeling in with great satisfaction in 
the belief that he has the purse -- on the end of the line 
comes the toupe.  Harpo, astonished, looks down on the victim 
who, minus the toupe, now displays a shiny bald pate.

Harpo takes out his fountain pen and releases gadget. The 
ink pours down on the bald spot of the man below and spreads 
into the form of a toupe parted in the middle.  CUT BACK to 
Harpo - he places the toupe on the bare back side of a figure 
of Cupid carved on the arch.  He is now suddenly attracted 
by something on the stage -- it is a pool with a practical 
fountain in its center.  Harpo digs into a decorative flower 
box set in a groove in the proscenium arch.

He brings out a real live worm and baits his hook -- stands 
up and casts... the line swishes through the air and the 
hook lands in the pool on the stage.  The line instantly 
tightens and a large carp fish is yanked out of the pool...  
as the line is drawn in the fish nearly hits Mrs. Teasdale.

She covers her face with her hands.  Chico takes advantage 
of her action, grabs the line, removes the fish, and puts 
hook on handle of purse...  then signals Harpo with a whistle 
and in the manner of a construction foreman, motions to him 
to start "hoisting".  The line becomes taut and the purse is 
yanked out of view.  Mrs. Teasdale uncovers her face and 
discovers that the purse is missing.

MRS.  TEASDALE
(Hysterically)
My purse -- my purse is gone!

There is a buzz of excitement among the rest of the guests 
as they help Mrs. Teasdale look for the purse.

Chico joins in the search.  He grabs an elderly dignified 
man in the party, throws back his coat and starts to frisk 
him.

CHICO
He no got it ---

As he turns to frisk another man, Mrs. Teasdale says

MRS. TEASDALE
This is dreadful -- I must see His 
Excellency at once ---
(She exits from box)

CUT TO ballet dancers' dressing room, where we find Groucho 
still pumping away on Vera Trentino's leg ---

VERA
Are you sure you're not tired?

GROUCHO
Tired!  I'd like to stretch this 
into a week -

Mrs. Teasdale enters the scene.  The sight shocks her but 
she recovers herself sufficiently to hide the embarrassment.

MRS. TEASDALE
I hope I'm not interrupting.

GROUCHO
(Still pumping -  
looks over his 
shoulder at Mrs. 
Teasdale)
Take a seat -- you're next.
(He lets go of Vera's 
leg - and she exits)

MRS. TEASDALE
Your Excellency, something terrible 
has just happened.

GROUCHO
That's all right.  I'll fix you right 
up.

Grabs her ankle and starts to lift her leg - she gets away 
from him.

MRS. TEASDALE
My purse has been stolen -- the plans 
of war are in it.

GROUCHO
(Shouts)
WHAT  ?

Walks up and down puffing furiously on his cigar

MRS. TEASDALE
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect 
the Secretary of War.

GROUCHO
(Still pacing wildly)
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- 
What was that?

MRS. TEASDALE
I said - I suspect the Secretary of 
War.

GROUCHO
(Stopping dead in his 
tracks)
THIS IS TREASON!!
(Strikes a pose - 
raising his clenched 
hands; then to Mrs. 
Teasdale scornfully)
What a fool I was to listen to your 
siren song and fall a helpless victim 
under the insidious spell of your 
irresistible charms --

MRS. TEASDALE
But -

GROUCHO
(Paying no attention)
You satisfied your selfish whims, 
while nations tottered, dynasties 
rocked and the world plunged headlong 
into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --
(Throws her an arch 
look)
Not bad, eh?

Starts for door

CUT TO - Stage showing about eight bars of Vera Trentino's 
solo dance.  PAN to lower box - Mrs. Teasdale's guests are 
gone but Chico and Harpo are there -- Chico is examining 
plans of war.

CHICO
This is-a fine - you do a good job - 
you make-a no trouble and you waste-
a no time.  Come on, we take-a the 
plans to the Ambassador.  You gotta 
the address?

Harpo opens coat and across his shirt front is the ribbon 
with "462 North Myrtle Road" on it -- the door of the box 
flies open and Groucho bounds in

GROUCHO
Hands up!

Harpo and Chico throw their hands up and wheel around

CHICO
(Smiling)
You no gotta no gun.

GROUCHO
Who said I had a gun... Gimme those 
plans, you paper snatchers --

He makes a grab at Chico -- Chico passes the plans to Harpo - 
Groucho goes after Harpo - the latter leans away over ledge 
of box and holds the plans out over the stage.  As Groucho 
is trying to reach for the plans, Vera dances into scene, 
makes a graceful pirouette and with her outstretched hands 
takes the plans from Harpo.  As she dances away she deposits 
the plans in her bodice...

Vera's male dancing partner enters from the wings, walks out 
about four feet - stops and strikes a pose with uplifted 
hand.  Vera is dancing on the opposite side with her back 
turned.  CUT TO Groucho back stage - he sees the dancing 
partner - pulls a lever on switchboard marked "TRAP DOOR" -  
CUT TO stage as the dancer disappears through floor.  CUT TO 
shot of Vera - preparing to turn to join her partner - she 
reacts as she sees -- CUT TO Groucho standing on her partner's 
former spot holding the same pose ...

CUT TO full stage shot.  Groucho and Vera are dancing 
together.  During the dance Groucho tries to get the paper.

He bends her way over in an effort to make the paper drop 
out of her bodice.  Harpo and Chico, watching the struggle, 
quickly tear off their capes and coats and leap from the box 
on to stage in their shirts.

This develops into a four-cornered adagio dance.

She hands the papers to Harpo over Groucho's shoulder as she 
dances with him... Groucho rushes to Harpo and they do a 
twirl together.  Harpo hands the paper to Chico over Groucho's 
shoulder.  Groucho rushes at Chico and twirls with him - 
Chico in trying to pass the papers to Vera drops them on the 
floor.  They all make a dive for them.  Groucho gets the 
papers and dashes with them to the lower box just as Mrs. 
Teasdale enters same.

The following is a close shot of Groucho and Mrs. Teasdale.  
The latter standing on stage right by the box.

GROUCHO
(Handing paper to 
Mrs. Teasdale)
Here -- put these plans where no one 
will ever find them - sleep on them.

CUT TO - Dressing room just a Vera, Chico and Harpo enter. 

VERA
(Apologetically)
I'm sorry boys -- I did my best -- 
it's all my fault.

CHICO
It's not-a your fault.  It's-a his 
fault --
(Indicating Harpo; 
then to Harpo 
accusingly)
I fix it for you to getta the plans -- 
you getta the plans -- then you losa-
a the plans -- now we no gotta the 
plans of war...

Harpo lifts up his shirt and tattooed upon him is the 
reproduction of the war plans...

FADE OUT

END OF SEQUENCE "F"

SEQUENCE "G"

FADE IN - Mrs. Teasdale's living room.  Night.  Subdued light.  
We begin with an EXTREME CLOSE CLOSE SHOT of a hand depositing 
the plans of war in a vault.  This vault is about the height 
of a man, the door flush with wall.  The CAMERA TRUCKS back 
and discloses that the one depositing the papers is Mrs. 
Teasdale -- she is in negligee.  She closes the vault door, 
pulls a cord, closing a pair of drapes which hide the vault.  
The CAMERA PANS to the balcony above where Vera Trentino,  
also in negligee, is watching the action in the living room 
below.  She tiptoes quietly from the scene.

Downstairs, Mrs. Teasdale turns out the center table light 
and moves toward the stairway.

CUT TO Vera Trentino's bedroom.  Vera comes toward window, 
raises it quietly and waves a handkerchief, evidently 
signalling somebody below.

CUT TO EXTERIOR of house.  Chico and Harpo are waving back 
to signify that they have caught the signal.  The boys try 
to raise the window which is located next to the main 
entrance, but it is locked and they can't budge it.

CHICO
(Peeved)
It's all your fault. Now we gotta 
steal the plans again -- You had 'em 
on you... you take a bath... and now 
we no gotta plans of war.

They try the window again and find it hopeless

CHICO
(To Harpo)
You wait here -- I'll let you in.

Chico walks right in through the door, closes it behind him 
and then appears at the window.  He raises it from the inside 
and Harpo climbs in through the window and joins Chico.

CUT TO INSIDE.  They are walking cautiously across the room 
when they hear the following coming over scene -- "Psst... 
Psst..."  They stop and look around, trying to locate the 
source of the sound.  We CUT TO the balcony and see Vera 
Trentino, still dressed in her negligee.  Once more she tries 
to attract them.

VERA
Psst...

The boys look up and see her.

VERA
(In a half whisper - 
mysteriously)
In the safe -- behind the drapes --
(Pointing in the 
direction of the 
safe)

CHICO
(Also in a half whisper)
All right -- I'll meet you behind 
the drapes.

VERA
(In a half whisper)
No, no -- I mean the plans are in 
the safe.
(Pointing to safe 
again)

Harpo hasn't taken his eyes off of Vera during all this, 
makes a sudden dash for her, as she turns to her room.

Chico stops him on the second or third step of the stairs.

CHICO
Come on, we gotta no time for that.

Chico goes over to the safe and draws the curtains, disclosing 
safe.  Harpo follows and takes from his back pocket a rather 
large electrical drill with a cord and plug attached to it.  
Chico takes the cord and plugs it into the wall socket.

Harpo starts to drill the safe door, making a terrific noise -- 
the usual reaping whir-r-r of an electric drill.  Chico grabs 
his hand and stops him from drilling.

CHICO
Wait a minute...  we make too much 
noise...  Turn on the radio so they 
can't hear what we're doing.

Harpo goes over to radio and turns it on... a dance tune 
comes over the air.  Harpo grabs Chico and whirls him around 
as if he were dancing with a dame...

CHICO
(Jerking himself away 
from Harpo)
What's-a matter, you crazy... ?

Chico goes to radio and adjusts dial to another station... 
the following comes over the air...

RADIO POLICE ANNOUNCER
Calling car 125... car 125... go to 
vacant lot at Tenth and Elm... a 
woman walking around in her nightgown ---

Harpo drops the drill and makes a wild dash for door obviously 
to go to the woman... Chico stops him.

CHICO
Come on, we gotta finish the job...

RADIO POLICE ANNOUNCER
Calling car 67-W... car 67-W... go 
to Mrs. Teasdale's residence... 
burglars are attempting to break in.

Chico rushes to phone... and dials...  This shot excludes 
Harpo.

CHICO
(Into phone -- after 
slight pause)
Hello -- Police department... ?  
That fellow's  crazy...  we're in 
the house already...

Chico turns to listen to the next announcement - hanging 
onto receiver.

RADIO ANNOUNCER
The Teasdale residence is located at 
232 Poloma Drive...

CHICO
(Into phone)
You'll never find us, you gotta the 
wrong address...  we're at 235 Poloma 
Drive... not 232...  Look, it's a 
white house with a shingle roof -- 
shingle -- shingle --
(and sings to 
illustrate)
Shingle bells, shingle bells, shingle 
all the way...
(Stops singing)
That's it, you got it... Hurry up, 
if no get-a here soon, we can't 
wait...

Hangs up... looks around for Harpo, who is not there...

CHICO
Hey, Skippy...
(Puts his fingers to 
mouth and whistles.)

CUT TO Vera's bedroom.  It is a CLOSE SHOT showing Vera in 
bed, shot from side of bed.  She is under the bedcovers 
desperately trying to keep them from being pulled off her... 
TRUCK back disclosing Harpo on the other end of the bedcovers, 
trying to pull them off her... for a moment following, a tug 
of war goes on, Harpo pulling the covers about a foot his 
way and Vera pulling them back...  The sound of Chico's second 
whistle coming over scene attracts Harpo, who lets go of the 
covers and runs out of the room.

We pick him up outside of the room on balcony.  Without 
hesitation he slides down the bannisters to join Chico who 
is waiting at foot of stairs.

CHICO
(Exasperated)
Hey, you never get the safe open 
that way.
(Looking up at Vera's 
room)
We gotta try the combination...  You 
gotta the combination?

Harpo nods and takes from under his coat a woman's silk 
combination... winks and looks back in the direction of Vera's 
room...  Chico snatches it out of his hand and throws it 
away.

During above Mrs. Teasdale has come out on balcony, sees the 
boys but can't distinguish them in the room which is 
practically in darkness except for a few splotches of 
moonlight.  She runs back into her room...

CUT TO Mrs. Teasdale's room...  she is at telephone dialing 
a number...

MRS. TEASDALE
(After a slight nervous 
pause)
Hello?  Your Excellency?  There are 
burglars in the house...  I want you 
to come right over.

CUT TO Groucho's bedroom.  He is at the other end of the 
phone in bed.

GROUCHO
(Into phone)
You come over here.  There are no 
burglars in my house.

CUT BACK to Mrs. Teasdale at phone.

MRS. TEASDALE
(Into phone)
But Your Excellency, you must -- I 
tell you there are burglars here...  
Oh, thank you...  Please hurry...

CUT TO Chico and Harpo in living room below at safe.

Harpo has just finished putting a stick of dynamite in the 
door of safe...

CHICO
Light it... Now we blow him up...

Harpo strikes a match, but Chico stops him from lighting it.

CHICO
Wait a minute... we gotta fix it so 
it don't make-a so much noise... 
What-a we do?

Harpo takes out a large wad of cotton, tears it, hands two 
pieces to Chico... they both stuff their ears with large 
pieces.

CHICO
That's fine... Now, nobody hear the 
noise.

Harpo lights fuse... each stands on either side of safe door 
waiting for the explosion... after a slight pause, there is 
a terrific blast of sound... and the screen is masked with 
smoke.  The smoke clears away and the safe door falls to the 
floor.  Groucho walks out of the safe putting the plans of 
war in his inside pocket...

After a few steps he stops and addresses the boys...

GROUCHO
That woman is crazy... there are no 
burglars around here...

FADE OUT

END OF SEQUENCE "G"

SEQUENCE  "H"

FADE IN - to insert of newspaper which comes from background 
to CAMERA.  A screaming headline reads:

WAR DECLARED!!

This insert goes past the CAMERA as another newspaper comes 
from the background.  The headline reads: -

"ENEMY APPROACHING CAPITOL"

DISSOLVE to Groucho's office.  Groucho is standing in front 
of his desk reading a newspaper, which is spread over his 
desk.

The headline is the same as in the second insert -

"ENEMY APPROACHING CAPITOL"

Harpo is standing at the other side of the desk.

GROUCHO
(Pounding his desk)
They're coming...
(He recites the 
following command to 
Harpo)
Ride through every village and town 
wake every citizen up hill and down 
tell them the enemy comes from afar 
with a hey-nonny-nonny and a ha-cha-
char

CAMERA TRUCKS back disclosing a real horse beside Harpo.

GROUCHO
There'll be two lamps in the steeple 
if they're coming by land and one 
lamp if they're coming by sea.

He and Harpo go to the window and look out.

CUT TO SHOT of a steeple with three lighted lamps -

CUT BACK to Groucho and Harpo

GROUCHO
They double-crossed me... they're 
coming by land and sea -- Be off, my 
lad!

With a grand gesture, Groucho exits out of scene.

Harpo grips pommel of the saddle with both hands and in his 
attempt to make a flying mount, vaults clear over the horse 
landing on the other side.  He lets down a rope ladder from 
under the saddle, climbs the ladder, mounts the horse and 
starts off.

DISSOLVE to CLOSE UP of Harpo riding at breakneck speed.  As 
he looks grimly ahead he reaches down out of scene and brings 
up a three-cornered colonial hat and puts it on his head.

DISSOLVE to a Moving Insert - Harpo bringing the horse to a 
stop in front of a farm house.  He blows a blast on a regular 
army bugle... immediately a few old men rush out of the house 
in their nightgowns, carrying guns, and into the scene from 
all directions rush other men, answering the call, similarly 
attired.  Harpo starts his horse and we DISSOLVE to him 
pulling up to another farm house.

This house has a single door on the extreme end of it and a 
very large French window covering almost the rest of the 
house.  Harpo stops and sounds the bugle call.  This time 
there is no answer to his call.  He waits a second, then 
turns his horse in the direction of the house and rides 
through the single door.  After a short pause, the doors of 
the French window fly open and the horse runs out pulling a 
double bed which is on wheels.  Harpo is standing at the 
foot of the bed, braced against the bedpost, holding the 
reins.  There is an old couple, man and woman, fast asleep 
in the bed - (This couple might be the blase gentleman and 
young wife used by Peter Arno in his cartoons.)  After riding 
a few feet Harpo leaps from the bed onto the horse's back 
and rides off leaving the bed and its occupants on the road.

DISSOLVE to Harpo pulling up to another farm house.

He stops, sounds his bugle.  A very pretty young girl, in 
her night clothes pokes her head out of the second story 
window.  Harpo takes a good look at her, leaps off his horse 
and dashes into the house.  A moment later he comes out of 
the house with a feed bag and puts it on the horse's head....  
then he dashes back into the house again.  Almost instantly 
he comes tearing out of the house, followed by an old geezer 
in his nightgown, who is chasing him, with rifle in hand...

He fires a few shots -

DISSOLVE:

END OF SEQUENCE "H"

SEQUENCE "J"

DISSOLVE through the shooting of previous scene to STOCK 
SHOT of artillery fire on battle field - a profile SHOT with 
all the activity of an actual battle, but without an 
indication of falling men.  DISSOLVE from this to interior 
of Groucho's headquarters behind the front - a wooden shack.  
The sound of a distant booming of guns is heard over this 
scene.  On the wall is a large war map with colored thumb 
tacks indicating the positions of Groucho's men and the enemy.

Groucho, in the uniform of a Confederate General, (a Robert 
E. Lee make-up), is studying the war map with a few of his 
Generals.

GROUCHO
(Looking at a tack in 
a distant sector)
Either there's a fly in the room or 
we've got a soldier in Africa.

The door flies open and Bob, in a snappy uniform, enters 
excitedly and breathlessly.  He faces Groucho with a quick 
salute and a click of the heels.

BOB
(Taking a dispatch 
from under his belt)
A dispatch from the front, sir.

Groucho snatches the dispatch from Bob's hand, tears it open -- 
reads it quickly -- claps his hand to his brow and staggers.  
The generals crowd about him.

A GENERAL
(Solicitously)
Bad news, sir?

GROUCHO
Bad news -- its disastrous!

A FEW GENERALS
(Simultaneously)
What is it?

GROUCHO
(Reading from dispatch)
Private Moscowitz quits!
(Groucho rushes to 
radio operator)

GROUCHO
Clear all wires...
(The operator works 
key)

GROUCHO
The enemy has taken Hill 25, throwing 
twelve Hill-billies out of work... 
Our front is exposed to the enemy -- 
we'll have to bring up the rear...
(Turning away, then 
turning back to 
Generals and 
continuing)
P.S.  Have misplaced flag of truce... 
look in upper lefthand drawer of my 
bureau...

The whining of an approaching shell is heard and a shell 
about three feet long comes sailing through the open window, 
speeds through the room and tears through the opposite wall, 
leaving a clean-cut hole.  Groucho rushes to window and closes 
it.

CUT TO:

SHOT of No Man's Land, with shells exploding in all 
directions.  We see a head slowly appearing over the edge of 
shell-hole, looking through spy-glasses.  It is Harpo...

CUT TO:

Inside of shell hole...

Harpo registers that he has seen something of startling 
interest.  He drops the glasses, scrambles out of shell-hole 
and runs out of scene.  He rushes to his waiting motorcycle 
(without the side-car).

The staff with the flag flying from it is attached to the 
handle-bars.  He leaps onto the motorcycle seat and starts 
off.

CUT TO:

A war nurse, attracted by the roar of the motorcycle.

She looks back, sees Harpo approaching and breaks into a 
run.

As he closes in on her, she jumps into a trench to escape 
him.  Harpo rides on a little further to the entrance of the 
trench and turns in, to continue his pursuit.  A TRUCKING 
SHOT shows only the flag and staff, tearing along above the 
surface, with the accompanying roar of the motorcycle which 
is hidden from view.  As it speeds along, soldiers are leaping 
up out of the trenches on every side to avoid being run down.  
This continues doing a zig-zag with abrupt turns...

CUT BACK TO:

Groucho's headquarters.  Groucho is discovered there alone, 
stropping his sword on a razor strap attached to his desk.  
Chico enters... goes to time-clock on wall, puts his workman's 
card in it and punches it.  Groucho, attracted by the bell 
of the time-clock, stops stropping and walks over to Chico, 
with sword in hand.

GROUCHO
Late again, eh?  You haven't been on 
time once since this war started...
(Puts sword in sheath)
Get out there and fight...
(Pointing commandingly 
in direction of battle 
field)

CHICO
I can't do it...

GROUCHO
(Surprised)
Why not?  You're the Secretary of 
War, aren't you?

CHICO
Yes, but I'm not working for you any 
more.  I'm on the other side.

GROUCHO
(Like a surprised 
child)
Is that so?  I used to think you 
were two-faced - but you can't be - 
or you wouldn't be wearing that one.  
Now - let's talk this thing over.

Groucho sits down at desk and Chico pulls up another chair 
and sits at opposite side of desk facing Groucho

GROUCHO
(Blowing out a puff 
of smoke)
Now -- how many men you got in your 
army?

CHICO
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand 
men.

GROUCHO
That's not fair -- we've only got 
fifty thousand.

CHICO
That's all right.  We let you have 
twenty-five thousand men -- and we 
both start even.

GROUCHO
(Enthusiastically)
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.

CHICO
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.

GROUCHO
Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- 
how many battalions you got?

CHICO
We gotta two battalions and one 
Frenchman.

GROUCHO
I wish you were still working for 
me, so I could ask you to resign.  
How're ya fixed for cavalry?

CHICO
I've gotta five thousand men but no 
horses.

GROUCHO
That's funny, we've got five thousand 
horses but no men.

CHICO
That's all right -- our men can ride 
your horses.

GROUCHO
Not a bad idea.  If our horses get 
tired they can ride your men for a 
change.
(Chico nods agreeingly)
Now, I don't mind letting you have 
our horses, but you must promise to 
put them through their maneuvers.

CHICO
Oh, sure.  We have horse maneuvers 
every morning.

At this point, an unusually large shell comes crashing from 
above, imbedding itself, point down, in the floor without 
exploding.  Groucho and Chico rush over to look at it.

GROUCHO
(Looking at shell)
Acme Ammunition Company, eh?  How do 
you expect to win the war with shells 
that don't go off?  Now, if you were 
buying your stuff from me, you 
wouldn't have that trouble.  Eureka 
Ammunition is guaranteed to explode -- 
or your money back.  Let me show you 
some samples.

Groucho opens door and yells to some one outside

GROUCHO
Bring in No. 47, line 8.

Harpo enters, bent forward, tugging at a rope which tightens 
over his shoulder, in the manner of a Volga Boatman... at 
the end of the rope is a cannon, on two wheels

GROUCHO
(Pointing to gun)
That's our latest number...  our 
sixteen-inch Horowitz gun.
(To Harpo)
Load it up.

Harpo pours a great quantity of powder into the cannon, then 
to make sure he has enough, he lights a match and looks into 
the hole.  Groucho takes the lighted match from Harpo.  He 
lights his own cigar, hands the match back to Harpo.  Harpo 
pours in a little more powder, makes sure he has enough, 
then proceeds to ram the powder in the barrel with his horn.  
He rises and moves to wall toward which the cannon is pointed.  
He draws a target on the wall with a piece of chalk -- goes 
back to cannon.  He picks up the firing string, and faces 
the target toward which the cannon is pointing.  Chico puts 
his fingers into his ears.  Groucho picks up a pencil from 
desk - taps it on desk - then raises both hands, in the manner 
of an orchestra leader.  He holds this pose for a second - 
and on the down beat, Harpo jerks the string and there is a 
terrific explosion.  The cannon fires out the back end instead 
of the front and blows a hole through the back wall.  The 
two stare off in the direction of the hole.  Groucho turns 
to Chico.

GROUCHO
With a gun like that you can kill 
some of your own men.

CHICO
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a 
dozen of them.

GROUCHO
Anything else?
(Writing order on pad)

CHICO
(Mentally figuring)
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen 
hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- 
and throw in some matches.

GROUCHO
(Writing)
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches 
before we make the delivery.  By the 
way, how're you fixed for spys?

CHICO
Fine.  We gotta him.
(He indicates Harpo)

GROUCHO
So! -- He's on your side, too.

CHICO
Sure.

GROUCHO
Well, with you two fellows on the 
other side, this country should have 
no trouble keeping the wolf from the 
door.

Harpo opens the door and discloses a dozen or more snarling 
wolves at the door.

CUT TO - INTERIOR enemy headquarters.   The booming of distant 
guns comes over the scene.  Trentino is there with a Sylvanian 
general.

GENERAL
Something must be done immediately.  
The soldiers are getting discouraged.

TRENTINO
There's only one thing to do... we 
must capture Firefly.

GENERAL
But how?  It's a very dangerous 
undertaking.

TRENTINO
(Standing near widow)
Ask for volunteers.  Some one must 
make the sacrifice -- someone --
(Stops to gaze out of 
window attracted by 
off scene roar of 
motor)
Here comes Chicolini.  Maybe he'll 
do it.
(Walks away from window)
Unless we can make Firefly our 
prisoner, we're lost.

Chico enters. Trentino rushes over to him

TRENTINO
Chicolini, you've come just in time.  
We need a man who's fearless, brave.  
A man who's willing to die, if 
necessary.

CHICO
All right -- I'll go out and find 
one.

TRENTINO
Firefly must be captured at any cost.

CHICO
That's easy, I'll get him for you 
wholesale.

TRENTINO
It must be done right away.

CHICO
I can't do it right away.

GENERAL
Why not?

CHICO
I got a date with a General's wife.

GENERAL
Isn't that a little dangerous?

CHICO
(To General)
Not unless you find it out.

CUT TO:

Interior of Groucho's headquarters.  Groucho is on his feet 
addressing five or six generals, who are seated.  Zeppo is 
at the desk writing the minutes of the meeting.

GROUCHO
Boys, I hate to do this, but if you 
generals want this war to continue 
you'll have to take a cut --

Bursting of a shell is heard right outside of shack.

Groucho rushes to the window, opens it, fires a shot from 
his revolver through the window, hurriedly shuts it, then 
rushes back to Generals

GROUCHO
We can't afford to pay the money 
we've been paying. Now I don't want 
to lay anybody off.  My motto in 
this war is: - "Live and let live".

The bursting of another shell is heard right outside of shack.  
Groucho rushes to the window, opens it, turns his back to 
window, takes out a pocket mirror, holds it up in front of 
him and shoots over his shoulder out of window, taking his 
aim from the reflection in the mirror, like a trick marksman.  
As Groucho walks away from window, he hears another explosion 
outside.  He rushes back to the window, takes a package of 
small firecrackers out of his pocket, detaches one of the 
firecrackers, lights it from his cigar and throws it out of 
the window.  A very small explosion is heard.  Groucho 
hurriedly shuts the window and rushes back to the generals, 
as we - CUT TO:

THE OUTSIDE - A LONG SHOT of a dirigible (miniature) --

then we go to a CLOSE UP of the dirigible.  On the bag, in 
large letters, is printed --

SYLVANIA

G-62

The CAMERA PANS DOWN to the cabin of the dirigible.

Chico and Harpo are standing at the open door looking down.

CHICO
Look!  That's-a Firefly's 
headquarters.
(Pointing down)
We catch him right now.

Harpo reaches back into the cabin, picks up an enormous hook 
and throws it out.  The rope that is attached to the hook 
starts playing out rapidly.

CUT TO --

LONG SHOT miniature of dirigible and rope dangling from it...

Then CUT TO - SHOT of rope and hook as it approaches Groucho's 
headquarters.  It hooks onto the roof of the shack and raises 
it off the ground.  CUT TO -

LONG SHOT - miniature of dirigible carrying the shack through 
the air.

CUT TO - inside of headquarters.

GROUCHO
(To generals)
Gentlemen, the overhead is killing 
us.  Everything is going up.  If we 
don't watch ourselves, we'll come 
down with a crash.  Now -- all those 
in favor of taking a cut say "aye"...

ONE GENERAL
(Protesting)
But Your Excellency!

GROUCHO
Carried unanimously.

CUT TO - SHOT of dirigible carrying the shack.

The shack just clears a steeple by a few inches.

CUT TO - INSIDE of headquarters.

GROUCHO
Now go right out there and fight.
(To one general)
You go out there and relieve General 
Beauregard, and while you're at it, 
see what General Motors is doing.

The general, without saluting, exits out of door and closes 
door behind him.

GROUCHO
(To another general)
Call him back -- he didn't salute 
me.

The second general exits out of door without saluting, closing 
door behind him.

ZEPPO
Father, he didn't salute you either.

GROUCHO
(Angrily)
Attention!

The remaining generals jump to their feet, stand at attention 
and salute.

GROUCHO
Go out there -- all of you -- and 
bring those generals back -- dead or 
alive.

All of the generals exit through to door; the last one closing 
door behind him.

GROUCHO
Why don't those generals come back?

ZEPPO
I'll call them.

GROUCHO
Never mind, I'll go after them myself.

Groucho goes to door, pulls it open, starts out --

CUT TO - EXTERIOR OF SHACK (against sky backing).

Groucho is seen in the open doorway.  He comes out and walks 
down the steps (there are three steps attached to entrance 
of door, with railing on each side.  Groucho is about to 
step off into space.  He grabs the railing and hangs by his 
hands.)

GROUCHO
Hey, Junior!

Zeppo rushes to door and pulls him up by the hands.

CUT TO - Inside as Zeppo finishes pulling Groucho in.  Groucho 
scrambles to his feet, rushes to window, leans out of window 
backwards and looks up.

CUT TO -- SHOT of dirigible as seen by Groucho.

CUT BACK inside of shack as Groucho pulls in his head.

GROUCHO
Get my rifle.

Zeppo runs for rifle...

GROUCHO
I'll get rid of them.

Zeppo returns and hands rifle to Groucho.  Groucho leans out 
of the window backwards and shoots up into the air...  CUT 
TO - dirigible (miniature) as the bag explodes.  The smoke 
fills the screen.  As the smoke clears away we see Groucho 
and Zeppo descending side by side in two parachutes against 
sky background.

GROUCHO
(To Zeppo)
Take a letter.

Zeppo takes out pad and pencil

ZEPPO
To whom?

GROUCHO
To whom it may concern...  Dear 
Gloria:  The air has done me a world 
of good.  I am five thousand feet 
above sea level speeding home to 
you.  Can you arrange to meet me at 
twenty-five hundred feet?  -- which 
is only asking you to meet me half 
way.  Don't be surprised if I drop 
in on you any minute... Your fun-
loving Dictator.

Groucho and Zeppo descend out of scene, as Harpo and Chico 
come into scene from above, both suspended from the ropes of 
their parachutes... They are in a sitting position, with a 
board across their knees, playing cards...

FADE OUT

END OF SEQUENCE "J"

SEQUENCE "K"

FADE IN - to a group of notables standing around a large 
table.  Among them are Mrs. Teasdale and Zeppo.  Groucho is 
the guest of honor, very gaily attired for the occasion.

As we FADE INTO this scene, they are singing -

ALL
(Singing)
Hail, hail, Freedonia...  Land of 
the brave and free!

ZEPPO
My dad is much too great for his 
position without a question.  I'd 
like to offer this with your 
permission as a suggestion: I really 
think he should be king!

ALL
We really think he should be king!

ZEPPO
I really think he should be king!

ALL
He should be king!

SOLO
And wear a crown and everything.

ALL
And everything.

SOLO
I really think he should be king!

ALL
He should be king!

GROUCHO
From what I have been gathering, I 
think they think I should be king: I 
think they think I should be king!

ALL
He should be king!

GROUCHO
And wear a crown and everything.

ALL
And everything.  He should be king!

Then follows a musical interlude during which Groucho says: -

GROUCHO
(Speaking to audience)
You know I think they think I should 
be king.
(Then turning to the 
guests - singing)
Although it would please me to govern 
the throng, suppose I were king and 
then everything went wrong.

MRS. TEASDALE
The king can do no wrong!

ALL
The king can do no wrong!  The king 
can do no wrong!

They all sit

GROUCHO
Of course you're All aware a king 
must have an heir some one to pass 
the family name along will some one 
tell me where I'd ever get an heir 
if a king can do no wrong

ALL
(Standing up)
The king can do no wrong!
(They all sit down)

GROUCHO
Suppose a pretty dame Into my castle 
came - And let us say that I was 
going strong.  She might be stuck on 
me, but what good would it be, if 
the king can do no wrong.

ALL
(Standing up)
The king can do to wrong!
(Sitting down)

GROUCHO
King Solomon was game he gave each 
Girl his name to number them would 
make a list that long I'll bet his 
thousand wives led miserable lives 
if the king can do no wrong.

ALL
(Remaining seated)
We really think he should be king 
and wear a crown and everything.

GROUCHO
They think I should - They think I 
should - They think I should - They 
think I should be king.

(APPLAUSE)
Mrs. Teasdale rises.

MRS. TEASDALE
My dear friends, in time of peace we 
should forgive those who fought 
against us, and so, I have invited 
our former enemies.
(Applause)

CUT TO door, as it is being opened by two pages.

Trentino and Vera enter.  They both stop and bow in 
acknowledgment of the applause coming over scene.

As they walk toward table and out of scene, Chico and Harpo 
enter.  The latter is carrying a carpet runner, rolled up 
under his arm. He flips the carpet runner away from him on 
the floor, holding onto one end.  It rolls out and Harpo 
strides majestically down its length toward the table with 
Chico following.  Harpo pauses, brings to light a cuspidor 
from under his coat, puts it on the carpet and spits into 
it, and continues on, following Chico, who is now ahead of 
him.  Harpo breaks into a run and he and Chico dash madly to 
the table.  They take seats on either side of Groucho and 
without hesitating, start to eat the food in front of them.  
The guests are standing.  Trentino and Vera arrive at their 
places and everyone sits down.

Harpo reaches for a large service plate with a pretty picture 
on it, pushes his plate away, breaks the service plate with 
a knife... it breaks into little pieces like a jig-saw puzzle.  
He mixes the pieces up, and then starts to put them together 
again ... Groucho watches him... then helps him...

GROUCHO
(Stopping Harpo as he 
tries to fit a piece)
No, no, this is the one...
(Picking up a piece 
and placing it...)

A waiter places a dish of tasty food in front of Groucho... 
he is just about to dig into it with his knife and fork when 
Harpo turns the table toward himself.  This brings Groucho's 
food to Harpo, and Chico's empty plate to Groucho...

GROUCHO
That was awfully good, I think I'll 
have a second helping...  waiter...

Snapping his finger to waiter off scene.  The waiter 
immediately appears placing a second dish in front of Groucho.  
He starts to dig his knife and fork into it again when Chico 
turns the table toward himself... This brings his food to 
Chico... Harpo lifts his plate up and puts it down again 
when the table stops turning... this time Groucho has nothing 
in front of him...

GROUCHO
If I don't stop eating I'll get 
indigestion...

A WOMAN GUEST
(To the left of 
Chico... to Chico)
Would you mind passing the salt?

CHICO
(Yelling to Harpo)
Hey, she wants some salt...

Harpo takes salt shaker from man to his right, places it in 
front of himself and gives the table a quick turn toward the 
woman next to Chico...

Groucho is still without food.  He rises and looks about 
table... Sees a dish of food in front of Trentino, who is 
seated at opposite side of table...  Trentino is eating.

GROUCHO
(Yelling to Trentino)
Ambassador, how's the food?

AMBASSADOR TRENTINO
(Looking up and turning 
in direction of 
Groucho)
It's delicious, Your Excellency.

GROUCHO
That's all I wanted to know.

He gives the table a quick turn and Trentino's plate 
disappears as it spins around toward Groucho...

Just as it gets to Harpo, he lifts up the plate...  the table 
goes on a few feet more and when it stops, Harpo puts down 
his plate and starts to eat...  again Groucho has nothing... 
Groucho picks up his napkin and wipes his mouth.

GROUCHO
I couldn't eat another thing.
(He stands up)
Ladies and gentlemen, I want to 
introduce to you a man who is a prince 
of good fellows, generous to a fault, 
his own worst enemy and a devil in 
his own hometown...

Applause... Groucho steps up on the table

GROUCHO
Thanks, I didn't expect to be called 
upon... However, in conclusion I 
want to tell you that I promised 
Mrs. Teasdale I'd marry her if we 
won the war.... Well, we won the war 
and I'm stuck... to the victor belongs 
the spoils...

The table starts to turn slowly...  Groucho starts to walk 
in opposite direction... staying in same place.

GROUCHO
In union there is strength...

The table moves a little faster...  Groucho increases his 
pace accordingly...  CUT TO Harpo and Chico now seated beside 
each other turning the table...  CUT BACK to Groucho...

GROUCHO
I feel that we are taking a step in 
the right direction, and that's what 
I call balling the Jack...

Speed of table turning increases.  Groucho keeping pace 
against it in tread-mill fashion...

GROUCHO
Now is not the time for political 
temporizing, all interests must be 
sacrificed for the common weal...

CUT TO Harpo and Chico turning table... faster and faster...  
We CUT BACK to Groucho who is now galloping to keep his spot 
but he's not going any place

GROUCHO
All those who want to place their 
money on the wheel, step inside, 
faint heart never won fair lady...  
Money won't grow in your pocket like 
the hair on your head and now is the 
time for all good men to come to the 
aid of their party.

This FADES OUT on a shot with Groucho running madly, and 
gesticulating, taking in Harpo and Chico turning the table...

SHOOTING DRAFT



PROLOGUE

Berlin.

Season is March.

Action of the picture takes place in approximately 36 hours.

Picture commences at approximately 12:35 in the day.

Time: The Present.



EXTERIOR REVOLVING DOOR

Show general natural action of people going in and people 
coming out but in it is the definite inference of people 
arriving and people leaving the big hotel.

MOVE INSIDE THROUGH THE REVOLVING DOOR -- very quickly. CAMERA 
PAUSES ON THE THRESHOLD like a human being, seeing and 
hearing.

DISSOLVE OUT.

DISSOLVE INTO: Clock. It is twenty minutes to one -- and 
then moves slowly into the crowd of busy mid-day business 
jumble.

CAMERA pushes through crowd and passes by the foot of the 
steps that lead up to the restaurant. In its journey, it 
passes Kringelein looking up. He is not pointed.

THE CAMERA then saunters -- getting a slow profile movement 
across -- near Senf's desk. Senf is very busy. THE CAMERA 
now passes -- profile -- the desk of Senf. General action. 
Senf stands before his background of slots and keys. WE 
PROCEED until we are facing the elevator.

At that moment the elevator is opening. Among the people who 
emerge is Suzette, who moves too quickly for us to distinguish 
who she is.

THE CAMERA PANS quickly with her and in the distance we hear 
her saying to Senf:

SUZETTE
Madam Grusinskaya will not want her 
car.

This line is only just above the general clatter of action 
but it is picked-up sharply first by Senf then by Bell-Captain -- 
and as the CAMERA SLOWLY TURNS AROUND, we see the boy going 
towards the door and we hear the voice in the distance, 
saying:

VOICE
Cancel Madam Grusinskaya's car.

The CAMERA now backs away from the scene into the BAR. (a 
section.) It backs to the back of the bar and proceeds -- in 
profile -- behind the backs of the barmen. A mixed crowd of 
people drinking before their lunch.

We pick up the Doctor, leaning his head upon his hands, 
looking into space. The woman next to him, a noisy blonde, 
is laughing. The doctor glances up at her -- she glances at 
the doctor. She and the audience see the scarred side of his 
face -- the laugh dies on her lips and she turns suddenly to 
her companion, who is the Baron. We do not get much of a 
chance to see him because at that instant he is glancing at 
his watch, his shoulders are turning away from THE CAMERA 
and he moves out towards the lobby.

BACK UP a few feet and LAP DISSOLVE as you move into the 
main aisle of busy room in restaurant. Great activity of 
waiters. The bustle and activity of fashionable lunchtime. A 
string orchestra is playing.

Among other things, we pick up the smiling face of the pompous 
Maitre d'hotel, he has apparently just shown someone important 
to a table.

THE CAMERA watches his face and follows him. His face just 
as CAMERA reaches service table. The pompous Maitre d'hotel 
now becomes a thing of drama as he demands of a waiter:

MAITRE D'HOTEL
Where is that gentleman's soup?

The waiter, frightened and perspiring, doesn't bother to 
argue -- he tears off quickly (CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM) to 
another service table. The waiter seizes buss-boy's arm:

WAITER
Where's that soup?

Boy goes off at great rate of speed, CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM, 
into service room of kitchen. Boy stops at soup chef's 
counter. He is not the only waiter wanting soup at that 
moment. He pushes his way to the front and puts his ticket 
forward.

BOY
Quick -- come on -- come on...

The soup chef, used to impatient waiters, makes no exception 
of the young man. He looks at him as much as to say: "I'll 
slap you on the mouth." At the same time he is pulling over 
a cauldron of soup.

CUT TO:

CAULDRON OF SOUP being pulled over -- it dislodges a small 
cauldron that is near the edge. We see the soup fall and 
hear the scream of a woman before showing her agonized face -- 
She has been scalded. General steamy confusion. The chef has 
filled the plate. WE PROCEED the buss-boy out. Half way down 
the aisle, the waiter takes it from him.

THE CAMERA follows the waiter who places the soup before Mr. 
Preysing. Preysing has been waiting, with his serviette 
carefully tucked in his collar. His spoon is in his hand. A 
horrible man, ready for action. The soup is in front of him, 
he tastes it, pushes it away, frowns, we feel he is going to 
tear the place down.

WAITER
(anxious voice)
Yes.

PREYSING
(grimly)
Cold.

VOICE
(near Preysing's elbow)
Mr. Preysing...

PREYSING
(in same voice)
Yes...

BELLBOY
Telephone -- from Fredersdorf --

Preysing rises, struts from restaurant. CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM -- 
He walks out through the door...

DISSOLVE OUT AND INTO:

Between two operators heads. Odd effect at board. CAMERA 
TILTS UP as Preysing's head looks right down at girl.

Bellboy is with Preysing.

BELLBOY
Mr. Preysing from Fredersdorf -- his 
call.

GIRL
Yes, Mr. Preysing --

Preysing begins drumming his fingers on the top of 
switchboard.

GIRL
(nervously)
They've gone -- Just a moment, sir...

PREYSING
(to boy)
You told me it was on -- you said 
the call was through.
(he waits irritably)

SECOND GIRL
(to first)
Who's in number three?

FIRST GIRL
Senf -- the hall porter.
(Girl looks off at...)

CUT TO:

SENF IN TELEPHONE BOOTH

SENF
Yes, it's Senf, the head porter, 
Grand Hotel... Are you at the 
Clinic?,... How's my wife?,... Is 
she in pain?,... Isn't the child 
coming soon?,... Patience! It's easy 
for you to talk... Get away?,... No, 
I can't -- I'd lose my job. It's 
like being in jail. Oh, I hope the 
child comes along all right.

At the conclusion of Senf's speech, CAMERA MOVES TO NEXT 
BOOTH. Thru the glass door we see Preysing approaching from 
desk. He enters booth and commences conversation:

PREYSING
Hello! Long Distance?,... Get off 
the wire... No... I was talking to 
Fredersdorf... What?,... Oh... 
Hello!... Is that you dear?... How 
is everything at home?... What do 
you hear from the factory?... No... 
How are the children?... I left my 
shaving set at home... Yes, is your 
father there?... Hello, father?... 
Our stock has gone down twenty-three 
points. If our merger with the Saxonia 
doesn't go through -- I don't know 
what we can do... Hello, hello... 
yes, papa. Rely on me -- everything 
depends on Manchester... If they 
refuse to come in -- well, we will 
be in bad shape... no... Rely on me, 
I'll make it go through -- I'll make 
it go through... Waiting?... Yes, 
I'm still speaking...

THE CAMERA THEN PANS TO Suzette. Suzette is already in the 
booth and she is waiting for Mr. Meierheim to come on.

SUZETTE
(starting to speak)
Hello, Mr. Meierheim?... Is that, 
Mr. Meierheim?... This is Suzette... 
Suzette, Madam Grusinskaya's maid... 
No... Madam Grusinskaya will not go 
to the rehearsal... No... Madam is 
in a terrible state, she didn't sleep 
all night -- She's very tired... No, 
I'm speaking from a booth -- I didn't 
want to speak in front of her... I 
gave her a tablet of veronal... She's 
sleeping now... You had better come 
to the hotel, I'm afraid...

PAN TO BARON just entering booth. He is lighting a cigarette. 
(receiver down - trick)

BARON
(speaking into 
telephone)
Baron Gaigern speaking. Yes, Baron 
Gaigern himself. Where are you?,... 
Good... No -- first, I need money. I 
need it right now. I have to make a 
showing... That's my business. I 
hope to do it tonight... at the 
theatre or after the show... But 
money -- for the hotel bill, for 
tips... I don't need advice, I need 
money!... Now, listen...

PAN TO KRINGELEIN - booth.

KRINGELEIN
Who is that, This is... Hello, 
hello!... Who is that... Heinrich? 
This is Kringelein. Hello, Heinrich. 
This is Otto Kringelein. Hello! Can 
you hear me?... I've got to speak 
very quickly. Every minute costs two 
marks ninety... What?... Otto 
Kringelein! Yes, I'm in Berlin, 
staying at the best hotel, the Grand 
Hotel... No, don't you understand? I 
want to explain, but I must do so 
quickly, it costs so much. Please 
don't interrupt me -- hello? Hello! 
Listen! You know that will I made 
before my operation? I gave it to 
you. I want you to tear it up. Destroy 
it. Because, listen, I came to Berlin 
to see a great specialist about that 
old trouble of mine... It's pretty 
bad, Heinrich. The specialist says I 
can't live much longer.
(louder)
I haven't long to live! That's what's 
the matter! Hello, hello. Are you on 
the line? No, it isn't nice to be 
told a thing like that. All sorts of 
things run through your head. I am 
going to stay here in Berlin. I am 
never coming back to Fredersdorf. 
Never! I want to get something out 
of life, too. You plague, and bother, 
and save -- and all of a sudden you 
are dead. Heinrich... You don't say 
anything. I am in the Grand Hotel, 
do you understand, the most expensive 
hotel in Berlin? I'm going to get a 
room here. The very best people stay 
here. Our big boss, Preysing, too. I 
saw him -- not five minutes after I 
was here. Sometime, I'd like to tell 
him exactly what I think of him. 
Listen, Heinrich -- I have taken all 
my savings; my life insurance, too; 
I cashed in all my policies, the 
sick benefit fund, the old age 
pension, the unemployment insurance, 
the burial fund and everything... 
What's that, miss?... Hello, Heinrich. 
I have to hang up now. I have to pay 
three times overcharge. Just think, 
Heinrich! There's music here all day 
long. And in the evening, they go 
around in full dress... Yes, sometimes 
I have pain, but I can stand it. 
Everything is frightfully expensive 
here. You can imagine, the Grand 
Hotel... What? Time's up...

Near the conclusion of Kringelein's speech, we see the Doctor 
approaching through Kringelein's booth. He is looking down 
at something.

CUT TO:

COMPLETE REVERSE - MATCH SHOT - SHOOT THEM BOTH TOGETHER

Doctor is looking down at parcel. Kringelein's voice on same 
track. CAMERA BACKS UP. Show doctor as he passes various 
booths -- voices of respective people come up sharply.

KRINGELEIN
I'm a sick man -- Heinrich -- Hello - 
hello -- Operator -- every minute 
two marks ninety.

Doctor passes Baron's booth next.

BARON
Dangerous?... That's my business... 
I'll do it tonight -- ...I'll do it 
alone.

Doctor passes Suzette's booth.

SUZETTE
Madam is afraid -- she will never 
dance again -- there was no applause 
last night --

Doctor passes Preysing's booth.

PREYSING
Yes -- the merger -- Manchester -- 
it is my business as much as yours -- 
we've already lost eighty-five 
thousand --

Doctor passes Senf's booth.

SENF
I'm on duty -- I can't leave the 
Grand Hotel -- it's like being in 
prison -- the baby --

Doctor crosses to telephone operator:

DOCTOR
(to operator)
Any calls?

GIRL
No, Doctor.

DOCTOR
(half to himself)
Grand Hotel -- people -- coming -- 
going... Who cares... nothing ever 
happens.

FADE OUT.

SEQUENCE "#1"

FACADE OF HOTEL

showing electric sign -- odd angle -- THE GRAND HOTEL -- 
unlighted.

CUT TO:

ELECTRIC CONTROL ROOM

small section -- Engineer pulling down lever.

FACADE OF HOTEL

sign flashes on.

DISSOLVE OUT:

DISSOLVE INTO: EXTERIOR HOTEL

Shooting directly on swinging door -- normal crowd action. 
Tea-dansant at this hour is daily rendezvous for smart demi-
mondaines, gigolos, out-of-town travelers, etc. -- These 
types indicated.

In the distance we hear music.

DISSOLVE SUDDENLY TO:

YELLOWROOM - NEAR SHOT OF BAND

This same music is being played by the Eastman Jazz Band in 
the Yellow Room of the hotel.

THE CAMERA does not wait but backs down the room. It is the 
hour of the tea-dansant.

As the CAMERA IS BACKING OUT OF THE ROOM which is in reality 
the restaurant converted -- the tall figure of the Baron -- 
he proceeds through the door of the restaurant --

Note: Question here as to whether Yellow Room will be the 
restaurant converted, or not. In which case it will be 
necessary to add scene of Baron walking through corridor 
upstairs -- giving sense of distance.

The Baron is whistling the tune of the orchestra, he proceeds 
through the lobby as if on a mission. He glances at a pretty 
woman who passes and nods good evening to the Doctor, who is 
seated in his chair, not far from the desk. He enters.

CUT TO:

FLORIST SHOP

Pretty girl is there, she has seen him coming. She turns 
from the door and hands him a box of orchids, already tied 
in ribbon.

BARON
Good little girl -- nice ones?

GIRL
Yes, Baron.

The Baron would stay and flirt but he has a mission; he 
leaves.

CUT TO:

LOBBY

In the lobby we pick up the Baron leaving the florists with 
small box of flowers -- he crosses quickly to Senf's desk.

SHOT OVER SENF'S HEAD as the Baron puts the flowers down. 
Senf is busy.

The Baron is whistling gaily -- tapping his fingers on the 
flower box -- he is good-natured and patient.

SENF
(to Clerk -- as 
telephone bell rings)
Is that for me?

CLERK
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to 
be brought.
(he replaces the 
receiver)

SENF
(to one of the bellboys)
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be 
brought.

Boy leaves. We hear his voice out of scene at the door.

BELLBOY'S VOICE
Madam Grusinskaya's car... to be 
brought.

SENF
Good evening, Baron.

BARON
(amiably)
Good evening. Will you send these up 
to Madam Grusinskaya?

SENF
Yes, Baron.
(he hands the box of 
flowers to the clerk)
Madam Grusinskaya.

Clerk hands box to bellboy.

CLERK
Room one-seventy -- Madam Grusinskaya.

BARON
(to Senf)
Have you my tickets for the theatre?

SENF
Oh yes, Baron --
(to Clerk)
Baron von Gaigern's seats for Madam 
Grusinskaya.

Telephone rings again. Clerk picks it up.

SENF
(to Clerk)
For me?

CLERK
(at telephone -- shakes 
his head)
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not 
to be brought.

SENF
(to boy)
Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be 
brought.

The Clerk hands Senf the tickets which Senf hands to the 
Baron.

BARON
Charge them...

As the Baron is picking up his tickets he looks around quickly 
as he hears the voice of Pimenov, who has arrived apparently 
from his afternoon walk from the rehearsal at the theatre.

PIMENOV
(to Senf)
Good evening -- my key -- one sixty-
eight.

BARON
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.

PIMENOV
Oh -- good evening, Baron.

BARON
How's the beautiful lady?

PIMENOV
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the 
truth, Baron -- tonight we are a 
little bit nervous. Were you at the 
theatre last night?

BARON
Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya 
dances.

PIMENOV
Well -- last night was not so good.

BARON
I thought she was splendid!

PIMENOV
Yes -- but the audience.

At that moment they are interrupted by a vehement little 
Japanese with his wife. They are arguing with the Clerk. The 
Japanese speaks in Japanese to his wife.

CLERK
(to Japanese)
The parquot loges are behind the 
parquet chairs.

JAPANESE
Then they've put me back and I want 
to be up in front. How is that, chairs 
in front of loges?

Senf is speaking to a lady at the same time.

SENF
The train leaves at seven-thirty, 
Madam. That is the only through train -- 
the dining car goes along.

The Baron and Pimenov exchange glances as the little Japanese 
speaks volubly to his wife.

BARON
(sarcastically)
It's always so quiet here.

PIMENOV
If you occupied the room next to 
Madam Grusinskaya, you would 
appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.

BARON
My dear sir, I would gladly change 
rooms with you.

PIMENOV
(effeminately)
No doubt you would, Baron. But do 
you know, I'm quite indispensable to 
her. I'm her ballet master and her 
nurse. I hardly belong to myself 
anymore. But, there you are, it's 
Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring 
her.

At that moment, Zinnowitz pushes past them.

ZINNOWITZ
Pardon me.
(addressing Senf)
Is Mr. Preysing in -- I am Doctor 
Zinnowitz.

SENF
(to bellboy)
Mr. Preysing -- from Fredersdorf --

BELLBOY
(quickly -- paging)
Mr. Preysing --

Preysing steps quickly into scene.

PREYSING
Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.

ZINNOWITZ
Have I kept you waiting?

PREYSING
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from 
Manchester.

ZINNOWITZ
No news yet?

PREYSING
No. No word.

ZINNOWITZ
Everything depends on the Manchester 
merger.

PREYSING
I know -- I know.

ZINNOWITZ
I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as 
your lawyer I made it my business to 
broach the matter ---

As they begin to move out of scene, Zinnowitz calls back to 
Senf.

ZINNOWITZ
I'm expecting a young woman -- a 
stenographer -- she will ask for Mr. 
Preysing. Ask her to wait.

SENF
Yes, Doctor Zinnowitz.

As they move out of scene, telephone bell goes.

SENF
(to Clerk)
For me?

CLERK
No -- letters to two-eighty.

SENF
(to Clerk)
If a young woman, a stenographer, -- 
etc.

This just covers the scene.

The Baron and Pimenov are laughing at something one of them 
has said which brings our attention to them again.

At that moment the Doctor enters the scene.

DOCTOR
Any letters?

SENF
No, Doctor.

DOCTOR
Telegrams?

SENF
No, Doctor.

DOCTOR
Anyone asked for me?

SENF
Nobody, Doctor.

The Doctor turns slowly away, taking out a cigarette with 
his one hand.

BARON
(glancing at Doctor)
The war.

PIMENOV
(looking up from his 
letter -- glances 
off at the doctor)
That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You 
know him?

BARON
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting 
for something -- and nothing ever 
comes.

PIMENOV
The war dropped him here and forgot 
him.

BARON
(beams)
Yes, I was in the war.

CUT IN: FLASH OF DOCTOR --

He turns as he hears the Baron say this.

He pulls at his cigarette and looks grimly at the Baron... 
then he looks off at Kringelein -- who is trying to get 
Rohna's attention (the reception Clerk) -- at the reception 
desk, which adjoins that of Senf's.

KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
Please -- please pay some attention 
to me -- I have no time.

Pan back to desk:

ROHNA
(engaged with a lady 
and gentleman, who 
have just arrived)
If you will wait one moment, sir.

KRINGELEIN
I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I 
waited three days before I got a 
room at all and what a room that is.

ROHNA
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, 
sir.

KRINGELEIN
Did I say I wanted a cheap room to 
live in -- when I came here did I 
ask for a cheap room? Did I?

Rohna, sensing a scene with this strange dirty little 
gentleman, looks furtively around for the manager.

ROHNA
Just one moment, sir.

KRINGELEIN
No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every 
day is precious -- every hour -- 
Every minute.

Second Clerk is looking straight at him.

Kringelein turns his attention directly to this man and 
proceeds:

KRINGELEIN
I came here because I wanted to live 
here, two weeks, maybe three -- God 
only knows -- I've told you I'll pay -- 
I'll pay anything you ask. I'm tired -- 
I'm ill -- I can't wait.

As he finishes the Doctor draws into the scene -- he is 
watching.

Assistant Manager enters.

ASSISTANT MANAGER
Has the gentleman a complaint?

Rohna and Kringelein speak together.

ROHNA
The gentleman is dissatisfied with 
room number five fifty-nine.

KRINGELEIN
I certainly have a complaint -- and 
a fair one.

He senses an audience and warms up. The Baron and Pimenov 
enter the scene. The lady and gentleman have turned. The 
bellboy stands watching curiously and even Senf pauses and 
looks up.

KRINGELEIN
(continuing)
I came here from a long distance to 
stay at the Grand Hotel. I want a 
room -- a big room -- like you would 
give General Director Preysing -- 
I'm as good as Mr. Preysing -- I can 
pay like Mr. Preysing -- would you 
give him a little room, way up in 
the corner with the hot water pipes 
going -- bang -- bang -- bang...
(he bangs at the desk 
with his fist)

DOCTOR
This gentleman can have my room.

KRINGELEIN
(turning)
Oh!

DOCTOR
Send his bags up to my room.

KRINGELEIN
Oh -- but -- I --

DOCTOR
You're tired. I can see that.

KRINGELEIN
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have 
been ill...

DOCTOR
You are ill.

During this scene the manager has been talking with Rohna 
quietly. The manager how turns.

MANAGER
Mr. Kringelein will take room number 
one-seventy-six, one of our most 
expensive rooms. It is large and on 
the front with bath.

KRINGELEIN
(subdued -- exhausted --)
Does that mean that the bath is my 
own? --- Private?

MANAGER
Certainly, sir.

KRINGELEIN
Well, now, that's very kind -- thanks. 
That's what I want -- a large room 
on the front with a private bath -- 
Yes, that's what I want. I can pay 
now if you like.

He takes out his wallet and nervously commences to extract 
money.

DOCTOR
That will not be necessary.

The manager is instructing the bellboy to take Kringelein to 
the new room.

Kringelein accidentally drops a bill -- the Baron, who has 
noticed the money, stoops to pick it up.

In bending himself, Kringelein drops his hat.

Baron picks up the hat and considerately brushes it with his 
sleeve.

KRINGELEIN
Thank you, sir.

BARON
(amused)
Not at all, sir.
(he beams)

KRINGELEIN
(finding a friendly 
face)
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- 
from Fredersdorf.

BARON
I'm Baron von Gaigern.

KRINGELEIN
Oh, a Baron!
(he is impressed)

Baron catches the mood of making this gentleman suddenly 
popular.

BARON
And this is Doctor Otternschlag.

KRINGELEIN
(turning to Doctor)
Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- 
I am --

DOCTOR
I know -- I know -- when a man's 
collar is an inch too big for him -- 
I know he is ill.

KRINGELEIN
Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, --
(his finger goes 
nervously to his 
collar)

Zinnowitz passes through scene quickly on his way out.

At that moment, Pimenov returns from the news-stand, where 
he has bought the evening papers.

PIMENOV
Well, Baron -- I must go and dress.

KRINGELEIN
(to doctor)
Is this gentleman a Baron, too?

PIMENOV
(laughing)
Unfortunately no.

The Manager comes into scene.

MANAGER
Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.

KRINGELEIN
Again?

MANAGER
Please.

Kringelein turns to the desk. The Doctor turns up with him.

At that moment the Baron's chauffeur touches his arm.

CHAUFFEUR
Have you a minute now?

BARON
No -- I told you not to come in this 
lobby.

CHAUFFEUR
Time's getting short.

BARON
I've told you a hundred times not to 
speak to me with a cigarette in your 
mouth.

Chauffeur takes the cigarette out of his mouth -- but still 
holds it in his hand.

CHAUFFEUR
I want to speak --

BARON
Not now.

CHAUFFEUR
Yes, sir.

The Baron leaves.

General moving off, towards elevator, of Baron, Pimenov, 
Kringelein and the Doctor.

SENF'S DESK

On another shot, shooting profile onto Senf's desk, bring in 
Flaemmchen. Flaemmchen enters. Her back to CAMERA.

FLAEMMCHEN
(we hear her ask)
Mr. Preysing.

SENF
Will you wait please.

CLERK
The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. 
Preysing telephoned.

SENF
Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.

FLAEMMCHEN
Thanks --
(calling off to 
elevator)
Heigh! -- Wait!

She crosses to elevator.

THE CAMERA RUSHES UP BEHIND HER, ALMOST PUSHING INTO ELEVATOR 
WITH HER.

As she enters the elevator and the gate shuts, she turns 
around, back pressed against the Baron -- who is looking 
down at her. The look on her face is the look we often see 
on Flaemmchen's in elevators when they are pressed.

NOTE: Good introduction, for Flaemmchen.

The lift ascends.

UPPER CORRIDOR

Flaemmchen steps out of the lift. She is looking around for 
the numbers. She moves out of scene.

The Doctor, Kringelein and the bellboy with the bag, move 
straight down the hall.

Pimenov is chatting volubly.

PIMENOV
(to Baron)
Poor Grusinskaya -- how can she 
receive anyone. She can't -- theatre, 
trains, hotels -- hotels, trains 
theatre.

We see Flaemmchen being directed by the floor clerk to Mr. 
Preysing's room.

PIMENOV
(continuing)
I must go and dress -- she'll be 
waking up and calling for me.

He proceeds up the passage, pompously, humming the air of 
his ballet.

At that moment, Flaemmchen, who has been directed to 
Preysing's door, by floor clerk, passes the Baron and there 
is an amusing exchange of glances between them.

Flaemmchen knocking at Preysing's door hears a voice.

PREYSING'S VOICE
Come in.

She opens the door.

CUT TO:

PREYSING'S ROOM

Preysing has had a bath and is actually steaming from it. He 
stands before a long mirror, rubbing himself with a towel.

He sees her through the mirror, wraps the towel around him 
very cutely, for a big man, and turns upon her.

PREYSING
What...! --

FLAEMMCHEN
I'm the stenographer.

PREYSING
Then you will please wait outside.

He is very much affronted.

Flaemmchen, who has seen many large gentlemen in the 
altogether --

FLAEMMCHEN
(lightly)
Don't hurry -- take your time.

She goes out of the room and shuts the door.

CUT TO:

UPPER CORRIDOR

Flaemmchen emerges from Preysing's room.

Baron loitering in the hall. (Whistling as outlined). Baron 
approaches, he is also whistling -- the same tune that 
Flaemmchen is whistling. She glances at him, as he continues 
whistling with an amusing dance step, as much as to say: 
"Are you mad?"

BARON
Like dancing?

FLAEMMCHEN
Not with strangers.

Baron glances back up the passage; it is apparent that he is 
going to make conversation here with this girl, in order to 
keep legitimately in the passage until Grusinskaya comes 
out.

BARON
(turning to Flaemmchen)
Never?

FLAEMMCHEN
You're a fool!

BARON
Yes, I am rather.

He glances down the passage again, his hands in his pockets.

She glances impatiently at her watch.

BARON
He must be very nice.

FLAEMMCHEN
Who?

BARON
(gallantly)
Whoever is keeping you waiting.

FLAEMMCHEN
(indicating Preysing's 
door)
Have you seen it?

BARON
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- 
really? That?
(indicating Preysing's 
door)

FLAEMMCHEN
That.

BARON
(with meaning)
You?

FLAEMMCHEN
(quickly)
Oh -- work!!

BARON
(with meaning)
Oh!

FLAEMMCHEN
Dictation.
(she twittles her 
fingers)
You know...

BARON
Oh... poor child. If you were free, 
I'd ask you to come and have some 
tea -- but --

FLAEMMCHEN
Tea would spoil my dinner.
(lightly)
One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil 
it.

BARON
Reducing?

FLAEMMCHEN
(she turns invitingly)
No -- why? -- should I?

BARON
Lord no -- charming -- but why one 
meal a day?

FLAEMMCHEN
(laughing in his face)
Money -- Ever heard of it?

BARON
Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are 
a...
(moves fingers)
...a stenographer. Don't little 
stenographers earn little pennies?

FLAEMMCHEN
Very little.

BARON
Too bad.

FLAEMMCHEN
Did you ever see a stenographer with 
a decent frock on? -- One that she'd 
bought herself?

BARON
Poor child --
(enthusiastically)
I wish I were free tonight -- we 
could --

FLAEMMCHEN
(with invitation)
Aren't you?

BARON
(quickly)
What?

FLAEMMCHEN
Free --

BARON
(glancing up passage)
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow 
though.

FLAEMMCHEN
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?

BARON
Shall we say five o'clock -- 
downstairs?

FLAEMMCHEN
Where downstairs?

BARON
Yellow Room where they dance --
(business)

FLAEMMCHEN
You're very funny --

BARON
(with great meaning)
Yes? -- Tomorrow?

FLAEMMCHEN
Of course.

BARON
Really?

Flaemmchen laughs at him.

BARON
We'll dance.

FLAEMMCHEN
(slowly)
All right. We'll dance.

At that moment we hear Kringelein's voice calling from his 
doorway at the end of the passage.

KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
Baron -- Oh, Baron!

The Baron turns and looks off at ---

KRINGELEIN

Kringelein is in his door in the distance -- radiant. He 
waves.

KRINGELEIN
If I could trouble the Baron to come 
and see this beautiful room. I have 
ordered champagne. Perhaps the 
Baroness could join us.

CUT BACK TO:

FLAEMMCHEN, BARON AND KRINGELEIN

KRINGELEIN
Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!
(to Baron and 
Flaemmchen)
We are having caviar -- it's expensive 
but that makes no difference -- I 
see the Baroness is laughing.

FLAEMMCHEN
Have caviar if you like, but it tastes 
like herring to me.

At that moment Grusinskaya's door opens suddenly and Suzette 
comes out into the hall.

SUZETTE
Ssshh! Please! Madam is asleep.

KRINGELEIN
Oh!

By this time the others are entering Kringelein's room. The 
Baron turns back for a moment.

BARON
(calling back quietly 
to Suzette)
Asleep? -- Ssshhh -- sorry!

Suzette turns back into the room.

CUT TO:

GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM

It is typical hotel. Half-open trunks, etc. Curtains are 
drawn -- room is in semi-darkness. There is a sense of 
silence, except for distant music coming from the Yellow 
Room below.

In Suzette's hands we see one of Grusinskaya's ballet slippers 
which she has been mending.

She is about to tiptoe to her seat when she stops suddenly 
and looks off dramatically at...

GRUSINSKAYA

Shot from her angle. She is sleeping beneath a Chinese robe, 
on the chaise-lounge.

Apparently she has changed her position, because the hand 
which is outside the robe moves.

The CAMERA, as though it were Suzette, moves up towards 
Grusinskaya. Her eyes are closed. Suzette crosses to the 
chaise-lounge and is looking down.

Grusinskaya's eyes open suddenly. She looks at the ceiling 
and then her eyes turn and look straight at Suzette.

SUZETTE'S VOICE
(quietly and reverently -- 
almost a whisper)
Madam has slept well.

GRUSINSKAYA
No, I have been awake -- thinking -- 
thinking.

SUZETTE'S VOICE
It is time for the performance.

GRUSINSKAYA
The performance?

SUZETTE
It is time.

Like a soldier called to attention Grusinskaya sits suddenly 
upright --

GRUSINSKAYA
Always the performance -- every day 
the performance -- time for the 
performance.
(she pauses and droops 
suddenly)
I think, Suzette, I have never been 
so tired in my life.
(she takes the bottle 
of veronal which is 
nearby)
Veronal didn't even help me to sleep.
(laughs a little)

SUZETTE
(speaking into 
telephone)
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be 
brought.

While she is speaking Grusinskaya rises -- with the grace of 
a dancer she picks up the Chinese robe that has fallen to 
the floor and although there is only one other woman in the 
room -- she holds the robe around her.

She crosses to the mirror and looks at her face, running her 
fingers through her hair. She gently massages under her eyes 
and the CAMERA sees Grusinskaya for the first time.

There is silence in the room -- neither of the women speak.

Suzette gets madam's clothes ready. She crosses, puts the 
case of pearls down on the dressing table and opens them.

Grusinskaya looks into space -- silence -- dead silence.

Suzette kneels as if to put Madam's stockings on for her. 
Grusinskaya pulls her foot away.

GRUSINSKAYA
I can't dance tonight --

SUZETTE
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.

GRUSINSKAYA
Let us cancel the engagement.

SUZETTE
But, Madam. cannot do that.

GRUSINSKAYA
Now is the time to cancel to stop 
entirely. I feel it -- everything 
tells me -- enough -- enough.

She leans forward against the dressing-table and her hands 
unconsciously touch the pearls.

GRUSINSKAYA
(very quietly)
The peals are cold -- everything is 
cold -- finished -- it seems so far 
away -- so threadbare -- the Russians -- 
St. Petersburg -- the Imperial Court -- 
the Grand Duke Sergei --
(long pause as though 
she were reliving 
incidents of the 
past)
-- Sergei -- dead -- Grusinskaya -- 
it's all gone.

She throws the pearls away, down upon the floor.

SUZETTE
Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they 
were to break --

GRUSINSKAYA
The pearls won't break -- they hold 
together and bring me bad luck ---- 
I hate them!

Suzette crosses replacing the pearls.

SUZETTE
Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- 
I think perhaps they are from the 
same young man -- he is at the end 
of the corridor -- tall -- he walks 
like a soldier -- Madam must have 
noticed how often he is in the 
elevator with us. Last night for 
instance --

GRUSINSKAYA
Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- 
quiet.

Grusinskaya's eyes are looking off into space -- she is away 
in Russia -- she does not look --

Telephone rings -- Suzette crosses to telephone.

SUZETTE
Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.

GRUSINSKAYA
Send it away -- I shan't need it.

There is a knock at the door -- a certain kind of knock.

GRUSINSKAYA
Come in.

She picks up the telephone and as she does so Pimenov enters. 
Suzette quickly gives Pimenov a signal that there is trouble. 
As Pimenov is closing the door we hear Grusinskaya speak 
into telephone.

GRUSINSKAYA
(authoritatively)
Madam Grusinskaya will not require 
her car -- no -- she will not be 
going to the theatre.
(she turns)

Pimenov (at heart a clown) makes a grand comedy bow. He will 
deliberately try to tease Madam out of her mood.

She glances at him, without smiling, crosses to the dressing-
table and sits.

PIMENOV
It is time for the performance.

GRUSINSKAYA
(under her breath)
The performance -- the performance -- 
the performance.
(during this scene 
the orchids fall to 
the floor)

It is a hysterical out-burst. It is not a woman who is just 
temperamental, it is something deeper than that. She is very 
near a nervous breakdown. We, the audience, must feel with 
her a revulsion against the word performance.

PIMENOV
(tenderly -- as he 
touches her shoulder 
gently)
Poor little Lisevata -- she still 
has her stage frights -- it will 
pass.

Pimenov kneels by Grusinskaya -- he is chafing her hands, he 
attempts to soothe her.

Now Grusinskaya draws her hands suddenly away.

GRUSINSKAYA
It is not stage fright -- it's 
something more --

PIMENOV
(tenderly)
What -- what is it? Last night...

GRUSINSKAYA
Last night?... There was no applause.

PIMENOV
(quickly)
There was -- there was.

GRUSINSKAYA
That theatre -- half empty -- dancing 
for those few -- I was frantic -- I 
finished -- the last beat and...
(she reclines her 
head as the swan 
finishing the dance)
...I waited -- I listened -- but the 
applause didn't come -- nothing. A 
man in the box -- and just the claques 
behind -- it is passed, Pimenov. We 
are dead -- it's finished.

There is a sudden knocking at the door.

PIMENOV
Meierheim --

The door opens suddenly. Meierheim bursts into the room.

MEIERHEIM
What is this that you have cancelled 
your car? Who am I that I should 
wait like a fool at the door? And 
here on a whim, you cancel your car. 
Have you forgotten there is a 
performance? Do you know the time? 
Or, are we all mad? Am I your 
manager?... Have we a contract? Have 
we obligations? Am I blind?
(glances at his watch)
...Or is that the time?

GRUSINSKAYA
I'm cancelling the engagement.

MEIERHEIM
Oh!

Business of Pimenov signaling to him.

MEIERHEIM
Oh! Madam is cancelling the 
engagement. Madam has chosen a funny 
time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, 
ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- 
there's a line in front of the theatre 
since six o'clock. The house is jammed 
to the roof.

GRUSINSKAYA
The house is not full -- Is it really 
full?

MEIERHEIM
Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get 
dressed. And what an audience -- the 
French Ambassador -- American 
Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- 
er -- er --

GRUSINSKAYA
(to Suzette)
Oh -- but it can't be.

SUZETTE
Oh, come, Madam -- please come.
(she holds up her 
frock)

GRUSINSKAYA
(changed mood)
All right, Suzette -- quickly -- 
hurry.

PIMENOV
We will wait.

MEIERHEIM
You are late. Hurry.

Meierheim goes over to telephone, he picks up receiver and 
says:

MEIERHEIM
Tell Madam Grusinskaya's chauffeur 
to bring the car.

Show few feet of Grusinskaya getting dressed.

CUT TO:

BY ELEVATOR

Pimenov and Meierheim.

Meierheim is pushing the bell.

PIMENOV
How is the house?

MEIERHEIM
Terrible. After this, no more ballets 
for me. Jazz --
(snaps his fingers)
Just jazz.

PIMENOV
If the house is empty again, I don't 
know --

MEIERHEIM
When she gets her paint on and hears 
the music -- she'll be all right. I 
know these people.

They are walking towards Kringelein's room. They are pacing 
rather like men who walk the deck on a liner. They turn almost 
together, but when they turn back past the CAMERA the CAMERA 
PROCEEDS on into Kringelein's room. The CAMERA ENTERS THE 
ROOM to a burst of laughter. Champagne bottles open, caviar, 
smoke, etc.

In the room are the Doctor, Kringelein, the Baron, Flaemmchen, 
and a very fat waiter -- comedian.

KRINGELEIN
You may laugh. Caviar and champagne 
may mean nothing to you, but to me -- 
they mean a great deal. You see, I'm 
ill and all of a sudden I got a fear 
of missing life. I don't want to 
miss life -- do you understand?

FLAEMMCHEN
You are funny. You speak of life as 
if it were a train you wanted to 
catch.

KRINGELEIN
Yes -- and for me, it's going to 
leave at any minute. Let's drink.

The Baron offers Flaemmchen a glass of champagne. She shakes 
her head.

KRINGELEIN
I'm sure this beautiful room must 
appeal to your taste -- distinctive, 
don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 
'A-number one'. I'm in the textile 
trade and I know.
(he has a slight case 
of hiccups from the 
champagne. He touches 
the drapes)
And these are real silk drapes.

FLAEMMCHEN
(amusedly)
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- 
they are, too.

KRINGELEIN
(who hasn't stopped 
talking)
Have you seen the bathroom? -- Hot 
and cold running water -- You see, I 
can get a bath whenever I like.

At that moment Preysing's voice is heard calling to the Floor 
Clerk.

PREYSING
The stenographer!

Flaemmchen, hearing this, turns and looks off, apparently 
through the door. Her manner changes, she puts down her glass.

FLAEMMCHEN
Her master's voice!
(turns to Baron)
I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.

KRINGELEIN
Oh, don't go.

FLAEMMCHEN
I'm engaged for the evening.

KRINGELEIN
Oh, can anyone engage you for the 
evening?

FLAEMMCHEN
To take dictation -- a Mr. Preysing --
(to Baron)
Goodbye, you -- tomorrow at five 
o'clock.
(she is moving out)

Kringelein's optimism has left him for a moment, he stands 
looking out of door undecided, he is drooped suddenly, as 
though years had returned to him.

BARON
What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?

KRINGELEIN
(to himself)
General Director Preysing!
(possibly he turns to 
Baron)
Baron, when I was sixteen years old, 
I started as an office boy in that 
man's factory --

BARON
Then you know him?

KRINGELEIN
Do I know him -- I know him through 
and through.

They start to leave. Oh, gentlemen, please don't go.

BARON
I must -- I hope to see you again, 
Mr. Kringelein.

Baron leaves.

KRINGELEIN
You will stay, Doctor -- if you have 
nothing better to do?

DOCTOR
I have nothing better to do, Mr. 
Kringelein.

They move into the room.

CUT TO:

NO SCENES: 24 and 25 Sequence omitted from original script.

NEAR ELEVATOR

Pimenov and Meierheim are standing there.

Meierheim is pushing the elevator button.

The Baron stands near and pauses, he is now a changed man. 
He looks off as he hears the voice of Grusinskaya, off in 
the distance.

Grusinskaya's Voice Hurry, Suzette.

GRUSINSKAYA

Shot from the Baron's angle. Grusinskaya is sweeping down 
the corridor, followed by Suzette.

CUT BACK TO:

BARON, PIMENOV AND MEIERHEIM

BARON
Perhaps you could present me now, 
Mr. Pimenov.

PIMENOV
Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not 
now -- here she is.

Grusinskaya sweeps into scene.

The Baron leans forward quickly and pushes the bell with a 
glance at her.

They look at each other. He fixes his eyes on her 
characteristically. She glances at him. This is the first 
time they have met in the picture.

She is impatient. As if to break an awkward silence, she 
turns to Suzette.

GRUSINSKAYA
My coat.

Suzette is carrying the coat over the pearls. As she takes 
the coat off her arm, Grusinskaya glances down at the jewel 
case.

GRUSINSKAYA
Suzette -- I told you not to bring 
the pearls. I will not wear them 
tonight.

MEIERHEIM
Why not?

GRUSINSKAYA
Take them back, Suzette.

MEIERHEIM
You haven't time.

Suzette hesitates.

GRUSINSKAYA
Hurry, Suzette.

MEIERHEIM
Such nonsense.

Suzette toddles off with the pearls.

The elevator opens, collects its passengers, all except the 
Baron and descends.

FLASH IN

A shot of Grusinskaya's eyes as she goes down, glancing up.

FLASH IN

A shot of the reverse of him looking down.

The Baron pauses, hesitates, thinks. We are interested in 
his action. For the first time he becomes furtive.

HOTEL LOBBY - FROM ELEVATORS

Music swells up from the Yellow Room. A great deal of noise, 
confusion and activity as the elevator stops to emit 
Grusinskaya, followed by Pimenov, Meierheim and some other 
people who are rather excited to be in the elevator with the 
great Grusinskaya.

MEIERHEIM
(off scene)
The car for Madam Grusinskaya.

The bellboy hears it and passes the word around. It seems to 
be echoed through the lobby.

People turn, as Grusinskaya's spirit seems to rise with the 
attention she is getting.

THE CAMERA precedes her through the revolving door, as she 
sweeps outside of the hotel.

The Baron's chauffeur, Schweinke, is seen to watch her go. 
He looks furtively around and enters the hotel.

CUT BACK TO:

UPPER CORRIDOR - CLOSEUP OF BARON

As he watches Suzette returning from Grusinskaya's room. She 
is about to push lift button - then decides to run downstairs.

IMPORTANT CLOSEUP OF BARON

FADE OUT:

END OF SEQUENCE "#1"

PREYSING'S ROOM

Zinnowitz and Preysing are standing by door.

PREYSING
No news from Manchester yet -- Do 
you think we ought to postpone the 
conference?

ZINNOWITZ
Good heavens no. That'd create the 
very worst impression. You must be 
optimistic. You must convince them. 
You know as well as I do that the 
merger must go through.

PREYSING
Yes -- the merger must go through -- 
But I am used to making my deals on 
a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am 
an honest business man -- a good 
husband and father -- I have a sense 
of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. 
I couldn't live happily otherwise.

ZINNOWITZ
Well, don't get excited about it. We 
agreed that the merger with the 
Saxonia people must go through.

PREYSING
I want to dictate my statement for 
tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. 
I like to have things down before me 
in black and white.

ZINNOWITZ
I'll see you in the morning then, at 
the conference. Everything'll be all 
right, Preysing... Don't worry. 
Goodnight.

PREYSING
Good night.

Zinnowitz leaves.

SEQUENCE "#2"

FADE IN ON BLACKNESS OF PREYSING'S ROOM

We hear the distant voice of Preysing and the keys of the 
typewriter rattling. The reason for the blackness is that 
Preysing's back is flat into the camera. His hands are behind 
his back and his fat fingers are moving restlessly. It is an 
odd effect. We don't know quite what it is.

PREYSING'S VOICE
Both parties have fully agreed that 
this merger can result only in mutual 
advantages.

Preysing moves forward showing that we are in Preysing's 
room.

The change of light shows us plainly the time lapse.

Flaemmchen is seated at a small table typing. Preying strides 
forward As he strides he says:

PREYSING
Moreover --

FLAEMMCHEN
(repeating)
Moreover --

Preysing paces the room.

PREYSING
(repeating)
Moreover --
(he pauses, thinking. 
Picks up telephone 
quickly -- into 
telephone)
Is there a telegram for me yet?... 
Oh -- when it does, send it up.

During this, Flaemmchen, who is tired sits back and rubs her 
fingers that have been over-worked. She glances at her wrist-
watch.

Preysing comes and stands behind Flaemmchen.

PREYSING
Now, where was I?
(he looks over the 
sheet in her 
typewriter -- 
accidentally his arm 
touches her neck)
Oh -- sorry.
(he puts his cigar in 
his mouth and walks 
away. As he walks 
away)
Where was I?

As he turns, he catches a down shot on her from behind as 
she stretches back showing her busts. Seeing his face looking 
down on her she pulls herself together and seats herself at 
attention.

FLAEMMCHEN
Moreover...

PREYSING
Moreover...

It seems a silly kind of lull.

PREYSING
Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' 
office?

FLAEMMCHEN
No -- only occasional jobs.
(she yawns suddenly)

PREYSING
Tired?

FLAEMMCHEN
You pay me.

PREYSING
You're a very unusual stenographer --

FLAEMMCHEN
Moreover...

PREYSING
Moreover...
(as he paces the room, 
it is obvious that 
he is trying to 
collect his thoughts)

She looks at him, waits a moment and then begins 
characteristically to, change the sheet of paper.

FLAEMMCHEN
I don't see why it's unusual for a 
stenographer to be pretty -- if she 
does her work well, -- seems so silly. 
I don't know why they don't like 
girls like me in offices. Personally, 
I hate offices -- I'd much rather be 
in the movies.

PREYSING
Movies?

FLAEMMCHEN
Yes, I photograph very well. Look --

She tosses magazine -- as if it were nothing at all over to 
him.

He looks down at it without touching it.

PREYSING
What is this?

FLAEMMCHEN
I got ten marks for that.

He picks it up.

PREYSING
You...

FLAEMMCHEN
(without looking up)
Me.

As he looks at picture -- he lowers his voice two notes.

PREYSING
You...

FLAEMMCHEN
(reading)
Moreover...

PREYSING
(quickly)
What?

FLAEMMCHEN
(reading)
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.

PREYSING
What brown hands you have.

FLAEMMCHEN
That's from skiing.

PREYSING
Skiing?
(he holds her hands)

FLAEMMCHEN
(natural -- unabashed)
Yes... A man I know took me to 
Switzerland last month...

He drops her hand suddenly.

PREYSING
A man? -- To Switzerland? -- That 
must have been nice -- for him.

FLAEMMCHEN
(reading)
Only in mutual advantages -- 
moreover...

Preysing paces the room trying to get his thoughts back to 
the work in hand.

PREYSING
Moreover... He was a lucky man -- 
that man.

FLAEMMCHEN
Perhaps.
(she waits at attention)

He paces back and forth again.

PREYSING
Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married 
man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --

FLAEMMCHEN
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?
(she takes cigarette)
I went to Florence once, too.

PREYSING
With the same friend?

By this time she is smoking her cigarette.

FLAEMMCHEN
(without looking at 
him)
No.

PREYSING
(quickly)
Moreover, the possibility of the 
successful termination of negotiations 
now pending with the Manchester Cotton 
Company...

FLAEMMCHEN
Not too quickly.

PREYSING
What?

FLAEMMCHEN
You're a little too fast.

PREYSING
Can't you understand me?

FLAEMMCHEN
I understand you perfectly.

PREYSING
Have you got it now?

FLAEMMCHEN
(typing)
Cotton Company --

PREYSING
Should throw a great weight into the 
balance...

FLAEMMCHEN
(as he turns his back 
looks at him 
significantly)
...weight into the balance...

There is a sudden knock at the door.

PREYSING
Come in.

Boy enters with telegram.

BOY
Telegram for Mr. Preysing.

With almost hysterical speed, Preysing snatches the telegram -- 
opens it. Flaemmchen powders her nose.

IMPORTANT CLOSEUP OF PREYSING

it is bad news. He wipes the perspiration from his forehead.

PREYSING
Oh -- oh.
(he throws the telegram 
away from him, onto 
her desk. Paces the 
room.)

Flaemmchen, believing the telegram to be something that she 
must copy, picks it up quite naturally and reads it.

FLAEMMCHEN
Deal with Manchester Cotton Company 
definitely off.

Preysing turns and snatches the telegram from her.

FLAEMMCHEN
Sorry.

Preysing paces the room with the telegram.

Flaemmchen rises, stretches. Quite naturally she glances at 
the pictures on Preysing's dressing-table.

FLAEMMCHEN
How nice -- your daughters?

PREYSING
My daughters -- yes, my daughters.
(he is talking more 
to himself)

FLAEMMCHEN
Is that Mrs. Preysing.

PREYSING
(to himself)
Definitely off.

FLAEMMCHEN
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel?
(she is looking at 
picture of Mrs. 
Preysing)

PREYSING
(turns, speaks quickly -- 
definitely)
That'll be all -- be here tomorrow 
at nine o'clock.
(he turns, goes out 
onto balcony with 
telegram)

Flaemmchen, delighted and with alacrity, crosses, piles up 
her papers and is prepared to leave.

CUT TO:

FLASH OF CORRIDOR

Trim Flaemmchen out of Preysing's room. Take her down to 
elevator.

At the same time, CAMERA PANS OVER and shows the Baron's 
chauffeur knocking at the Baron's door.

BARON'S VOICE
(calling)
Come in!

Trim the chauffeur into the Baron's room.

BARON'S ROOM

Baron is busy changing his clothes. Chauffeur steps in, he 
closes the door behind him and stands there with an 
inquisitive look.

CHAUFFEUR
You are late -- the dancer's gone to 
the theatre.

BARON
(very nonchalantly)
Well?

CHAUFFEUR
She's gone to the theatre -- don't 
you know?

BARON
(very nonchalantly)
Yes.

CHAUFFEUR
(ready to explode)
And what are you going to do?

BARON
The pearls are in her room.

CHAUFFEUR
(threateningly)
Now listen to me. The others are 
getting suspicious of you. I was on 
the telephone to Amsterdam today, 
they think you're scared.

BARON
I've been careful, I've been waiting 
my chance.

CHAUFFEUR
You've been waiting your chance. 
You're too much of a gentleman -- 
that's the trouble with you.

BARON
I told you I'll get the pearls 
tonight.

CHAUFFEUR
Need any help?

BARON
No.

CHAUFFEUR
Have you got that skeleton key?

He takes the skeleton key out of his pocket and produces it 
to the Baron.

BARON
No --

CHAUFFEUR
Why?

BARON
The floor clerk is out there in the 
corridor -- she sees everything ---

CHAUFFEUR
(contemptuously)
I could take care of her.

BARON
How?

CHAUFFEUR
Chloroform on a handkerchief from 
behind -- while you...

BARON
No -- no -- no -- no...

CHAUFFEUR
Why?

BARON
Poor girl -- chloroform would give 
her a rotten headache... I know -- I 
had it in the war. Besides, she's 
very pretty -- not young but --

CHAUFFEUR
You're no good for this business. 
It's just a joke to you...

BARON
(swings suddenly on 
him)
I don't like your tone.

CHAUFFEUR
(comes up to him -- 
face to face)
No --

Baron is suddenly seized with uncontrollable temper -- twists 
his wrists -- backs him to door, speaks quietly.

BARON
Get out and leave it to me... be 
ready to leave on the night train 
for Amsterdam...

CHAUFFEUR
With the pearls?

BARON
With the pearls --

The Chauffeur leaves.

The moment he is gone -- Baron looks the door -- business ad 
lib.

Crosses to window.

FACADE OF HOTEL

The Baron peeps out onto balcony -- it seems to be clear. He 
proceeds along and peeps into Preysing's room. Preysing is 
apparently in the bathroom. Baron skips nimbly past the room.

Working at thrill of pass through to Grusinskaya's room.

GRUSINSKAYA'S BALCONY

Baron is pretty shaken by jump.

CUT TO:

GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM

Darkness -- light from transom and building opposite.

Business of finding key and getting pearls. INTERCUT Preysing 
coming out onto his balcony, bringing out with him, loud 
speaker of radio -- which announces noisily as follows:

LOUD SPEAKER
'You are listening to the music of 
the Eastman Jazz Band, in the famous 
Yellow Room of the Grand Hotel.'

CUT TO:

GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM

Baron starts suddenly -- when he hears voice and with pearls 
in his hand, looks cautiously out of window -- only to see:

CUT TO:

SHOT FROM HIS ANGLE ONTO PREYSING'S BALCONY:

Preysing seating himself upon his balcony -- Radio loud 
speaker seen. Possibly Preysing commences dinner scene 
bullying waiter.

GRUSINSKAYA'S BALCONY

The Baron knows he is trapped, if he jumps onto Preysing's 
balcony, Preysing is the man that will cause the alarm.

Quickly he moves across the room -- tries the door -- it is 
locked securely. He looks for skeleton key and then remembers 
refusing it from the chauffeur. He is trapped in an absurd 
way.

As he moves back from the door, he knocks the telephone off 
of the table. He watches it for a moment, realizing that the 
operator must now know that there is someone in Grusinskaya's 
room.

He picks up the telephone, replaces the receiver, wipes finger 
prints off with his handkerchief.

He is moving back to window when telephone starts to ring 
suddenly. The thought crosses his mind they they will want 
to know who is in the room. He lets the telephone ring. 
Crosses to the door again.

Above the din of the telephone we hear the chambermaid's 
voice singing an absurd song.

He listens. She is coming in.

The key turns in the door.

Quickly he hides behind the curtains.

Slowly and amusingly the chambermaid, tired and dragging, 
enters the room.

He is looking for an opportunity to dash through the door. 
After all, this maid should be an easy person to get around. 
We have a feeling he wishes to dash through the door.

The chambermaid might be singing the same tune that we hear 
from Preysing's radio.

The telephone commences ringing. Chambermaid does not answer 
it but continues her duties.

At last, because of the noise of the telephone, she picks it 
up and speaks.

CHAMBERMAID
No -- no -- there is no one here.
(she replaces the 
receiver)

At that moment, the Inspectress, a large stout woman, appears 
at the open door.

INSPECTRESS
(to Chambermaid)
You're late... What have you been 
doing?

CHAMBERMAID
(grumbling)
Everyone -- all the time says, 'Come 
back - come back.' They won't get 
out of their rooms.

The Inspectress, in a very businesslike way, proceeds around 
the room, coming nearer and nearer the Baron. She is looking 
at ashtrays and running her fingers over the woodwork looking 
for dust. She tries the door to the next room, to see if it 
is locked.

Telephone bell rings again.

Inspectress picks it up quickly.

INSPECTRESS
No, Madame Grusinskaya is not here... 
The Western Theater?... No...

Suddenly, out of scene, we hear the voice of Suzette.

Suzette is calling out to the night clerk in the passage.

SUZETTE'S VOICE
Have you seen Madame?

CLERK'S VOICE
(replying)
Isn't she at the theatre?

Suzette comes in and hurries to telephone.

SUZETTE
Hello, hello, Mr. Pimenov? Yes... 
Mr. Pimenov, have they found her?... 
No, she is not here... Yes, I'm at 
the hotel.

INTERCUT

With the Baron watching.

GRUSINSKAYA'S BALCONY

During this action the Inspectress has waven the chambermaid 
out of the room. Business ad lib.

Meierheim enters, he has heard the word 'Pimenov' on the 
telephone -- he takes the receiver from Suzette.

MEIERHEIM
(into telephone)
Pimenov?... What's happening?... No, 
I haven't found her. Is Desprez 
dancing?... How is it?... Oh, all 
right. Keep the show going.
(bangs down receiver)
Wait till I see her, she'll pay for 
this -- this little trick is going 
to cost Grusinskaya a suit for breach 
of contract.

SUZETTE
Madame is ill -- her nerves...

MEIERHEIM
Her nerves... What about my nerves?... 
Who is she anyway? Where does she 
think she is -- Russia? Those days 
have passed.

He turns and sees Grusinskaya standing at the door. She is 
in costume, very pale, very beautiful. Her coat, over one 
shoulder, is ragging, she lets it drop and moves slowly into 
the center of the room. Her hair, dressed for the dance, 
make-up is on her face -- she is breathless.

SUZETTE
Madame --

MEIERHEIM
Well?

GRUSINSKAYA
I want to be alone.

The other women in the room draw out, leaving Suzette to 
pick up the robe that has fallen to the floor.

MEIERHEIM
Where have you been?

SUZETTE
Should I -- Does madame wish...

GRUSINSKAYA
Suzette, please go, I want to be 
alone.

Suzette obediently crosses to door and pauses on threshold, 
waiting for Meierheim.

Meierheim approaches Grusinskaya.

MEIERHEIM
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna 
engagement.

GRUSINSKAYA
I wish to be alone.

MEIERHEIM
You'll be very much alone, my dear 
madame. This is the end.
(he stamps out)

Suzette, with a frightened look through the door, closes it 
on Meierheim's exit.

DURING THIS SCENE, INTERCUT SHOTS OF BARON.

It is some time before Grusinskaya moves. She crosses to 
door -- turns the key -- takes the key out of the lock and 
throws it away from her -- out upon the floor. She crosses 
slowly to the mirror, regards herself, silently. We hear the 
strains from Preysing's radio playing a light Viennese waltz.

Grusinskaya begins suddenly to sob.

FLASH OF BARON

Watching her.

GRUSINSKAYA

Quite suddenly -- as if with resolution she begins to undress. 
Then she becomes weary again.

With a garment in her hand, she moves slowly toward the 
curtain -- where the Baron is standing.

BARON

We see him tense himself.

GRUSINSKAYA

She drops the garment listlessly to the floor -- moves out 
of scene.

CLOSEUP OF BARON

He peeps around the curtains.

CUT TO:

GRUSINSKAYA

She is in a thin robe. She sits before mirror -- looks 
steadily at her face. Her head goes down suddenly in her 
hands and we hear her say:

GRUSINSKAYA
The end -- over -- finished --

Suddenly she moves quickly across the room. Goes to bathroom.

Baron half starts out toward door. He watches -- darts across 
the room as if towards the door. He hears her coming and 
darts quickly into the half open door of the closet.

She re-enters -- carrying a glass of water. She crosses, 
places the glass down beside the bed -- her movements are 
quick and furtive -- then she crosses, picks up the telephone -- 
asks for the theatre.

GRUSINSKAYA
The Western Theatre --

She leaves receiver down -- crosses quickly to mirror -- 
stands there and brushes back her hair -- crosses back to 
telephone speaks:

GRUSINSKAYA
Western Theatre?

She glances up at the clock.

GRUSINSKAYA
The stage -- Mr. Pimonov -- the ballet 
master... Grusinskaya -- hurry -- 
hurry.

Again she puts the receiver down -- picking up a pencil she 
commences hastily to scribble a note. She writes frantically. 
Her other hand goes up and picks up the receiver.

GRUSINSKAYA
Yes -- yes, I'm waiting.

She finishes the note -- commences suddenly to speak into 
the telephone --

GRUSINSKAYA
Hello, Pimenov? -- I'm at the hotel. 
I couldn't go on -- I couldn't... 
No, no don't --
(long pause)
...Just alone... Good night, good 
night, my dear -- goodbye... Pimenov, 
how is it going, badly?... Uh?... 
Who's dancing?... Desprez?... Oh -- 
and how is it?... Oh, -- oh, I see -- 
they didn't miss me?... They didn't 
miss me.
(she lets her hand 
drop with the receiver 
and goes on talking 
into the air)
They didn't miss me -- good night, 
Pimenov...

She is about to replace the receiver. She sits with it in 
her hand, unreplaced.

The music has stopped. The room is strangely silent. Behind 
her the Baron peers from the closet.

Her head sinks down upon her hands.

A funny, singing noise comes from the telephone. She lifts 
the receiver to her ear. In a very strange voice, the voice 
of Opehlia, she speaks:

GRUSINSKAYA
(with great humility)
Oh -- I'm sorry, yes... I have 
finished.
(she replaces the 
receiver)

The foregoing scene is much better played than described. It 
is in fact, ballet.

Quite calmly, Grusinskaya finishes the notes on the table. 
She folds it up and places it in a prominent place on the 
table, or hangs it over the telephone.

She crosses to the window pulls back the curtains -- the 
Baron has been hiding behind a few minutes before.

We see the Baron watching. He glances at the door quickly. 
"No, there is not time." She is returning calmly. She crosses 
to the dressing table and takes the veronal out of a drawer. 
She looks at it thoughtfully, her lips are trembling a little. 
She moves to the radiator as if to seek warmth.

She sinks into a chair and her head droops over her folded 
hands which contain the veronal, she seems to pray.

The Baron comes from the closet -- now is his chance, he 
looks at the door but can't make it. Looks on the floor for 
the key which Grusinskaya has previously thrown there, his 
eyes fall upon the note on the telephone -- he reads it.

It is a death farewell note to Suzette -- do not insert it.

At this moment she has finished, the Baron returns to his 
hiding place. She makes the sign of a cross and goes to her 
bed.

She looks around nervously, apprehensively -- like a deer 
who has heard something, then reassured. She places the 
veronal on the night table beside the glass of water. She is 
quiet and deliberate. She arranges the pillows under her 
head and lies down. She reaches for the bottle of veronal 
and empties it generously in her hand. She has to lean away 
upon one elbow, from the Baron's position, in order to balance 
herself.

The Baron steps like a cat from his hiding place. He goes to 
the bedside noiselessly and stands there.

She reaches for the glass-her hand stretches out for the 
glass. The Baron takes her wrist suddenly.

She turns quickly looking at him. The glass falls to the 
floor with a crash and breaks. As she moves, the veronal 
falls out of her hands upon the bed. She struggles up to a 
sitting position.

BARON
Please, do not be alarmed, Madam.

She glances up at him. She is bewildered. She seems to be 
coming out of a trance. Again she wants to jump from the 
bed.

BARON
Careful -- there's broken glass on 
the floor.

Now she becomes conscious of almost nakedness. She draws her 
kimono tightly around her, glances across the wide expanse 
of bed. We see her consider passing over that way, but she 
is now a woman again -- a woman of the earth -- it would be 
a silly movement.

BARON
There.
(takes a pillow from 
the bed throws it 
upon the floor over 
the glass, steps 
back)

She gets up quickly and crosses, putting on her robe which 
was lying across the back of a chair.

Her first movement is not one of alarm but of -- shame. She 
draws her robe more closely around her and looks at the Baron 
puzzled. She thinks, dreamily, "What is this?" She glances 
back at the veronal and the bed showing us plainly that this 
man must have watched her preparation for bed. We get a sense 
of relief with her. She is trembling.

The Baron has controlled his nerves perfectly. He senses his 
danger. He is caught red-handed with five hundred thousand 
marks worth of pearls in his pocket. He is wondering if she 
will ring the bell. For an instant he thinks of escape. He 
could dash for the balcony. He could strike her dead or 
silence her with threats. There is in the room an intoxicating 
sense of romance and danger. (It should be in the scene.)

BARON
Please do not be frightened, Madam.

GRUSINSKAYA
(after a silence)
What do you want here?

BARON
Nothing -- only to be here.

GRUSINSKAYA
Why do you hide in my room?

BARON
But surely you must know -- because 
I love you.

GRUSINSKAYA
Because you love me -- you love me?

She looks at him for a few moments and then suddenly she 
throws herself upon the bed and begins to weep more and more 
passionately.

BARON
(going over to her)
Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do 
you good to cry? Are you afraid? 
Shall I go?

GRUSINSKAYA
I was so alone -- always alone -- 
and suddenly you were there and said 
that.
(sitting up)
No. I am not afraid. It is strange.

BARON
Don't cry -- it tears my heart to 
see you sob like that.

GRUSINSKAYA
(regaining control)
Nerves -- just nerves. You must 
forgive me. I have had a bad evening. 
I am very tired. Do you know what it 
is to be tired -- tired of a routine 
existence?

BARON
I'm afraid not -- I usually do just 
what I feel like doing at the moment.

A look in his eyes reminds her of the strangeness of the 
situation. She rises with returning dignity and pulls her 
robe around her -- she is becoming the Grusinskaya of Imperial 
Russia; she is the woman Grand Dukes have fought for. She 
sweeps across the room.

GRUSINSKAYA
So you feel like coming into a lady's 
room -- and you come... What now?

BARON
(following her)
I'd like to smoke a cigarette.

GRUSINSKAYA
Certainly.

She gets her cigarette box from the writing table and holds 
it out to him. He takes a cigarette and lights it. She watches 
him curiously. She smiles, as she watches him greedily inhale 
the smoke. She crosses and sits before her looking glass. 
She brushes her hair back and powders her face. She looks 
into the mirror, we feel that she has regained a desire to 
live. He crosses and looks at her in the mirror. He smiles.

GRUSINSKAYA
Why do you look at me like that?

BARON
I did not know you were so 
beautiful... and --

GRUSINSKAYA
(bitterly)
And then --?

BARON
No irony. You're so appealing -- so 
soft -- so tired. I feel like taking 
you in my arms and not letting 
anything more happen to you -- ever.

GRUSINSKAYA
(involuntarily closing 
her eyes)
And -- and --

BARON
How tired you are!

GRUSINSKAYA
Yes -- tired...

BARON
So alone.

GRUSINSKAYA
Alone. All alone.
(whispers in Russian)
Oh, you strange -- strange creature.

BARON
You mustn't talk Russian to me.

GRUSINSKAYA
Strange man...

BARON
Am I quite strange to you?

GRUSINSKAYA
Not quite strange now. It is as if I 
had been expecting you. You know, 
once when the Grand Duke was alive, 
I found a man hiding in my room -- a 
young officer --

BARON
And...?

GRUSINSKAYA
He disappeared. Later he was found 
dead.

BARON
I never knew it was so dangerous to 
hide in a woman's room when she's 
alone.
(he embraces her)

GRUSINSKAYA
Go away. Who are you --?

BARON
A man who could love -- that is all, 
who has forgotten everything else 
for you.

GRUSINSKAYA
You could love me. It is so long 
since I have heard that word. Nobody 
has loved me for a long time. It is 
so icy-cold to be famous. One is so 
cruelly alone. How is it that you -- 
Let me look at you. Your hands. Your 
eyes. Why could you love me?

BARON
I saw you just now -- then I saw you 
cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- 
Grusinskaya...

GRUSINSKAYA
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew 
how I slaved and slaved for 
Grusinskaya -- for the success of 
Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of 
Grusinskaya... and what is she now? 
Just someone who has found that on 
the day success ceases life ceases -- 
Are you listening to me -- Do you 
understand? -- I want you to 
understand.

BARON
Yes -- I do understand.

GRUSINSKAYA
I think you must go now -- the key 
is on the floor.

BARON
I'm not going -- You know I'm not 
going -- Let me stay here?

GRUSINSKAYA
I want to be alone.

BARON
That is not so -- you don't want to 
be alone.
(he looks back at the 
bed as if remembering 
the suicide.)

GRUSINSKAYA
I want to be alone --

BARON
No -- You don't want to be alone at 
all -- You were in despair before -- 
If I left you, you'd feel worse than 
you did before, You must not be alone -- 
You mustn't cry -- you must forget... 
Tell me that I can stay with you -- 
tell me.

GRUSINSKAYA
(whispering)
Just for a minute then.

Outside the distant noise of Kringelein is heard --

BARON
What? Say it again -- I didn't hear.

She whispers.

GRUSINSKAYA
You -- man...

The way she says it, the word goes home. It hurts him. She 
has looked into his eyes for a moment with a strangely melting 
and almost happy expression. She gets up suddenly.

(NOTE: The other side of the bed -- not where the glass is)

She reaches with her feet for her slippers. She puts one on. 
She can't find the other.

Business as he gets other slipper for her.

He kisses her ankle and looks up at her. She smiles down.

GRUSINSKAYA
Thank you -- you are gallant.
(she turns, her mood 
has changed)
What a sentimental scene. Grusinskaya 
weeping is a sight worth seeing. It 
is many years since she did such a 
thing... You frightened me -- badly. 
You're responsible for this -- painful 
scene.

He watches her.

The sound of her own voice reassures her. She is generating 
warmth. Her cry has done her good, she speaks quickly, 
volubly.

GRUSINSKAYA
The stage frays one's nerves... the 
discipline -- it's so exacting. 
Discipline means doing what you don't 
want to do and take no pleasure in 
doing. Do you know what I mean? Have 
you ever experienced the weariness 
that comes from discipline?

BARON
I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take 
pleasure in doing.

Grusinskaya turns, she is graceful again.

GRUSINSKAYA
I see -- you do only what you take 
pleasure in doing. You take pleasure 
in coming into a woman's bedroom and 
you come. You take pleasure in a 
dangerous climb onto a balcony, so 
you do it... And what is your pleasure 
now?

BARON
(naive as he says 
frankly)
I should like to smoke.

She rises. She had expected something else. His reply strikes 
her as chivalrous and considerate. She crosses to the writing 
table brings back her little cigarette box which she holds 
out to him. He takes a cigarette and lights it. She watches 
him curiously. She smiles, as she watches him greedily inhale 
the smoke. She crosses and sits before her looking glass. 
She brushes her hair back and powders her face. She looks 
into the mirror, we feel that she has regained a desire to 
live. He crosses and looks at her in the mirror, he smiles.

GRUSINSKAYA
Why do you smile?

BARON
Because I can see something in the 
mirror that you cannot. My dear --
(he pauses suddenly)

GRUSINSKAYA
What can you see?

BARON
You are beautiful!

GRUSINSKAYA
No.

BARON
Beautiful but so sad. I did not know 
it was so dangerous to look into a 
woman's bedroom.

Suddenly he stoops, takes her shoulder in his hands and kisses 
it. A long tender and sincere embrace.

Her eyes close. A tremor passes through her. Suddenly his 
whole being is aware of her. She turns, rises and disengages 
herself.

GRUSINSKAYA
I think you had better go now. The 
key is on the floor.

He glances back. He speaks suddenly with an air of command.

BARON
I'm not going... You know that I'm 
not going... Do you think I could 
leave you alone here? After that --?

GRUSINSKAYA
What?

BARON
The veronal -- you. I'm going to 
stay here with you.

GRUSINSKAYA
I want to be alone.

BARON
That is not the truth.
(he catches her wrists)
You do not want to be alone -- you're 
afraid of being alone -- I know you're 
afraid. I know you. You were 
desperate, just now, if I go away 
you'll be more desperate than ever. 
Say I am to stay with you... say it.
(he almost shakes her)

Her head falls slowly on his breast.

GRUSINSKAYA
(whispers)
For just a minute then.
(she pulls away, 
crosses the room, 
quickly to the door, 
with almost a cry. 
She looks around for 
the key to the door)
No -- oh, no!

He crosses quickly to her and holds her in his arms.

BARON
Just for a minute, Grusinskaya --

Outside the distant noise of Kringelein and the doctor.

FRONT ON SHOT OF KRINGELEIN

approaching the CAMERA with the Doctor.

They are returning from the bar and are passing Grusinskaya's 
room. THE CAMERA precedes them. The Doctor is 
characteristically drunk. He is silent, tense, cynical. A 
distinct contrast to Kringelein, whose soul is warmed for 
the first time by alcohol.

Kringelein's hat, the same, eccentric one, is twisted upon 
his head jauntily. The carnation is in his buttonhole.

THE CAMERA backs into Kringelein's room and pauses, because 
the Doctor has paused at the door.

KRINGELEIN
Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful. 
To live -- to live -- in the Grand 
Hotel.

DOCTOR
(with a deprecating 
gesture)
The Grand Hotel.

KRINGELEIN
Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the 
champagne -- girls when they dance -- 
all the shining ice in those big 
silver things -- That's life --

DOCTOR
Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are 
drunk -- good night.
(he leaves)

KRINGELEIN
(to doctor)
But Doctor --

But the Doctor has gone.

Kringelein re-enters his beautiful room. He crosses to the 
mirror, regards himself. Business ad lib.

He looks at himself in the mirror and raises his hat. 
Imitating the doctor, he repeats:

KRINGELEIN
Mr. Kringelein -- you are drunk -- 
good night.

He puts his hat on the knob of the bed.

He takes off his coat, holds it up and carefully takes the 
carnation out of his buttonhole. With the coat over his arm 
and the carnation in his hand he looks around for a glass 
and some water which he sees standing on the night table by 
his bed.

He puts the carnation in the glass, having filled it with 
water and then his eyes fall upon his small group of medicine 
bottles.

His demeanor changes. He immediately becomes a thing of pain.

He glances at his watch -- it is long past his medicine time -- 
his spirit droops -- he might almost be in pain.

He picks up a small bottle and carefully counts eight drops 
into the glass. He is about to take it, he smells it, a sudden 
impulse of well-being surges over him. He flings the medicine 
away.

With a great wave of optimism he commences to sing the song 
that we have heard during the evening -- the chambermaid 
song - the Preysing radio song -- the love song. He saunters 
around the room, undressing.

DISSOLVE OUT:

DISSOLVE INTO PASSAGE

His voice is still heard in the passage.

Rows of shoes outside the doors. The dozing night clerk hears 
the voice and looks up, startled.

DISSOLVE OUT:

DISSOLVE INTO A WATCHMAN

with his clock, hears the voice.

DISSOLVE OUT:

DISSOLVE INTO A CORNER OF DOCTOR'S ROOM

He is dozing in a chair with his clothes on. He looks up 
suddenly, hearing the voice.

DISSOLVE OUT:

DISSOLVE INTO PREYSING'S ROOM

He is snoring. The distant voice disturbs him. He turns in 
his sleep.

DISSOLVE OUT:

DISSOLVE INTO GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM

A beautiful picture -- the distant voices -- shadows.

BARON'S VOICE
I've never been as happy.

GRU'S VOICE
What did you say?

BARON'S VOICE
I've never been as happy!

GRUSINSKAYA'S VOICE
Say it again -- say it!

BARON'S VOICE
I have never been so happy!

DISSOLVE OUT:

DISSOLVE INTO KRINGELEIN'S ROOM

He is now dressed in an absurd night dress. He crosses to 
the bed, still singing, climbs into the huge bed -- the great 
pillows. His hand goes out -- he pulls out the light. He 
might be an Emperor as he turns with a happy, tired sigh.

DISTANT CLOCK CHIMES.

FADE OUT:

END OF SEQUENCE "#2"

SEQUENCE "#3"

FADE IN:

TELEPHONE ROOM

It is the first time we have seen it. There are about eight 
girls very busy. Morning confusion. (parts to be written)

We pick up essential lines as we PAN DOWN SHOOTING AT THE 
GIRL'S FACES, assuming the CAMERA to be the board.

GIRL ONE
Grand Hotel -- good morning -- no, 
Baron von Gaigern's room does not 
answer... Yes,... all right... Baron 
von Gaigern's chauffeur calling.

CAMERA PANS TO:

GIRL THREE
Good morning, nine-thirty Doctor 
Otternschlag... No, Doctor, no 
messages... No, Doctor.

CAMERA PANS TO:

GIRL FIVE
Grand Hotel -- good morning... who 
is calling Madam Grusinskaya?... Oh, 
Mr. Pimenov. Madam Grusinskaya is 
not to be disturbed, sir... no, sir... 
yes, sir --

The word passes down repeated.

VOICE
Mr. Preysing's calls to one sixty 
two for today.

CAMERA PANS TO:

GIRL EIGHT
-- good morning... Mr. Preysing --
(she plugs through)

CUT TO:

CONFERENCE ROOM

Telephone bell ringing.

General shot.

Gerstenkorn, an old business man and Doctor Waitz, counsel 
for the Saxonia organization are sitting at a gree table, 
smoking and waiting.

GERSTENKORN
(glances at watch)
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us 
waiting.

SCHWEIMANN
(who has returned)
He likes to play the great man.

WAITZ
(glancing at market 
report from table)
The Preysing stock is holding its 
own today on the market.

SCHWEIMANN
Ask Preysing what it's costing him 
to keep it up.

GERSTENKORN
And ask me what it's costing us to 
hammer it down.

WAITZ
Exactly.

GERSTENKORN
If the Preysing people get the 
Manchester contract, we shall 
certainly merge with the Preysing 
company -- but if they haven't they're 
ruined -- Preysing will have to 
declare himself.

WAITZ
Shhh -- here he is now.

The door opens and Flaemmchen enters. She is agreeably 
surprised to see the room full of men. She likes men.

FLAEMMCHEN
(beams)
Good morning, gentlemen -- Mr. 
Preysing will be here in a minute.

Business of Schweimann and Flaemmchen.

Gerstenkorn, making notes, glances at his watch again.

Door opens suddenly.

PREYSING
(enters)
Good morning, gentlemen.

MEN
Good morning.

PREYSING
Sorry I'm late, I've been waiting 
for Justice Zinnowitz, my legal 
advisor.

WAITZ
Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against 
us? -- The whole thing seems to me 
to be very simple.

GERSTENKORN
Very simple -- I've always liked the 
way you dressed, Preysing -- English, 
isn't it?

PREYSING
(disturbed)
What?

GERSTENKORN
(quickly)
They turn out marvelous material in 
Manchester.

PREYSING
Manchester -- yes. Yes, yes, they 
do. Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we 
begin at the beginning? -- Have we 
cigars -- water and everything?

Flaemmchen, who has been busy preparing her little table for 
work is seen in several CLOSEUPS:

SCHWEIMANN
(with a wink to 
Gerstenkorn)
Manchester is a very interesting 
city, don't you think so, Preysing?

PREYSING
(stalling)
Manchester -- yes -- yes. A man in 
the textile industry naturally has 
to know Manchester.

GERSTENKORN
There's a lot of business to be done 
with the Manchester Cotton Company. 
They've the whole English market 
right in their hands. Have you any 
connections with -- Manchester?

PREYSING
(quickly)
We have a good many connections in 
England, naturally.

GERSTENKORN
I mean with the Manchester people?

PREYSING
(looking at Gerstenkorn 
impudently)
We are here to discuss our merger. 
Naturally I can make no statement at 
this time. We must begin at the 
beginning.

GERSTENKORN
(winking at Schweimann)
All right.

PREYSING
(far-away commencing 
to read his report)
Since, on the eleventh of June, this 
year -- when the first negotiations 
for a merger between our respective 
firms was entered into -- both parties 
have fully agreed that this merger 
can result only in mutual advantages.

INTERCUT this speech, which if played by Beery will be 
interesting, with signals, winks and signs between the other 
three men.

GERSTENKORN
Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!

PREYSING
I'm laying before you the last general 
statement of our concern. Active 
capital, plant and machinery, raw 
material and finished product -- for 
instance -- mop rags --

GERSTENKORN
Mop rags --!

Business between Preysing and Flaemmchen finding papers on 
'Mop Rag' report.

GERSTENKORN
What we want to know about is 
Manchester.

WAITZ
Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we 
want to know.

PREYSING
I'd like to wait for Justice 
Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.

GERSTENKORN
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --

PREYSING
No water -- What a place!

GERSTENKORN
All you have to do is phone for it.

Flaemmchen, who is on her toes and busy every minute, rushes 
to the telephone and gives an order -- her conversation is 
heard over the conversation of the men in the room -- CAMERA 
HOLDS ON FLAEMMCHEN:

FLAEMMCHEN
Water -- seltzer, three or four 
bottles and cigars -- good ones.

WAITZ
I can see this session is going to 
be exhaustive.

PREYSING
Now to proceed with the projected 
merger, the advantages for the Saxonia 
are so obvious...

GERSTENKORN
Oh -- now let's talk like adults. 
You want to tell us now a along story 
of what your factory can do. We know 
all that you could tell us and if 
you tell the truth it wouldn't sound 
so good. When you first approached 
us...

PREYSING
We did not approach you.

WAITZ
(quickly looking 
through the papers)
Letter on file September fourteenth 
would show that you approached...

PREYSING
(snatching the document 
from his hand -- 
losing his temper)
It isn't so -- this was a response 
to a tentative feeler of your own.

GERSTENKORN
(snatching the document 
violently away)
Tentative my foot -- a month before 
this your old father-in-law came 
very privately and scratched at my 
door.

PREYSING
Scratched --
(he nearly chokes)
We did not take the initiative.

GERSTENKORN
Of course you took the initiative.

Zinnowitz enters the room.

ZINNOWITZ
Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the 
conference is already underway.

PREYSING
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- 
I'm at cross-purposes with these 
gentlemen -- will you clear up the 
situation?

ZINNOWITZ
But the situation is perfectly clear, 
If you will allow me --
(he clears his throat)

GERSTENKORN
How clear is Manchester?

ZINNOWITZ
Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, 
I'm told.
(to Preysing)
Have you said anything about 
Manchester, Mr. Preysing?

PREYSING
I can make no statement about 
Manchester at this time.

ZINNOWITZ
Well -- gentlemen.

There is dead silence for a moment -- he clears his throat, 
commences in almost the same tone as Preysing.

ZINNOWITZ
Since, on the eleventh of June of 
this year -- when the first 
negotiations for a merger...

GERSTENKORN
(over Zinnowitz's 
voice -- with a sigh -- 
sits back)
Thank God we're beginning at the 
beginning.

ZINNOWITZ
(stops suddenly -- 
takes glasses from 
his nose -- he is 
speaking, not reading)
As you remember it -- when you 
approached us...

GERSTENKORN
(bangs the paper down)
We did not approach you.

PREYSING
I know you did -- I said you did --

GERSTENKORN
And I said we didn't.

WAITZ
And I know we didn't.

During all this commotion Flaemmchen is paying no attention 
whatsoever. She is calmly spraying herself with a perfume 
atomizer and smiling at a gentleman. The noise continues 
over her.

CUT TO:

NO SCENE 61

Sequence omitted from original script.

GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM

The atmosphere has changed, the sun shines. Grusinskaya is 
reclining on the chaise-lounge -- her Chinese robe drawn 
about her. She speaks voluably.

GRUSINSKAYA
Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition 
was in my blood -- no rest, no 
stopping. We were drilled like little 
soldiers -- We danced in the school 
of the Imperial Ballet, in St. 
Petersburg. I was little and slim 
but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- 
No rest, no stopping. And then -- I 
became famous and whoever is famous 
is alone... But why should I be 
telling you this? Last night I did 
not know you at all -- who are you, 
really? -- I do not even know your 
name.

BARON
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My 
mother called me Flix.

GRUSINSKAYA
Flix. -- And how do you live? What 
kind of a person are you?

BARON
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep 
of a white flock -- I shall die on 
the gallows.

GRUSINSKAYA
Really?

BARON
Really, I haven't a bit of character. 
None at all.

GRUSINSKAYA
No?

BARON
When I was a little boy I was taught 
to ride and be a gentleman -- at 
school, it was a monastery, I learned 
to pray and lie -- and ---

GRUSINSKAYA
And?

BARON
And then, in the war, to kill and 
hide. That's all.

GRUSINSKAYA
And what do you do -- now?

BARON
I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large 
like a happy pig, devouring anything 
of life that pleases me, I really 
belong in jail

GRUSINSKAYA
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?

BARON
(seriously)
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief.
(he turns away)

GRUSINSKAYA
That's a silly joke.

BARON
(turns -- takes both 
her hands)
Please look at me. You must believe 
me -- you must believe that I love 
you -- that I have never known what 
love is -- until last night.
(he releases her hands 
and turns away again.)

GRUSINSKAYA
What is the matter?

He does not answer.

GRUSINSKAYA
Flix!

The Baron takes the pearls out of his pocket and lays them 
before her.

BARON
There.

GRUSINSKAYA
(with a little cry of 
pain)
Oh --
(in the silence 
Grusinskaya puts her 
head in her hands 
and thinks)

The Baron makes a gesture as if to stroke her hair and then 
holds back.

GRUSINSKAYA
(softly)
Did you come here just -- just for 
that? Oh -- it's horrible.

Pause.

She is suddenly cold.

GRUSINSKAYA
You may keep the pearls -- I don't 
want them any more -- I'll make you 
a present of them.

BARON
(passionately)
I don't want them now.

GRUSINSKAYA
(broken)
I'll not denounce you.

BARON
I know.

GRUSINSKAYA
So --

BARON
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --

GRUSINSKAYA
But now, you must go... I give you 
the pearls. But now you must go ---

BARON
I wanted money desperately -- Can 
you understand? -- That's why I wanted 
the pearls. I was threatened -- I 
was desperately in need of a certain 
big sum of money. I've been following 
you -- I've admired you. But I have 
forced myself not to think about you -- 
Last night, at last, I managed to 
came into your room and -- and now.

GRUSINSKAYA
(softly)
And now?

BARON
I couldn't go through with it.
(his head goes down 
into her lap -- he 
sighs:)
Remarkable.

His hand touches her hair -- tenderly.

BARON
Do you understand?

GRUSINSKAYA
Yes -- yes -- yes.

There is a sudden knock at the door.

GRUSINSKAYA
Quickly -- here.

With a quick gesture Grusinskaya beckons the Baron to the 
bathroom. He disappears into the bathroom. She opens the 
door, after finding the key and radiantly addresses Suzette.

GRUSINSKAYA
Good morning, Suzette.

SUZETTE
(delighted to see her 
in a good mood)
Good morning, Madam.

She puts the coffee down on the table.

Charming piece of business as Suzette, in putting the coffee 
down on the table must necessarily push back the heavily 
crested cigarette case of the Baron.

SUZETTE
Madam has slept well?

GRUSINSKAYA
(enthusiastically)
Oh, yes, Suzette.

SUZETTE
Madam will dress now, it is late.

GRUSINSKAYA
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in 
five minutes. I'll ring.

SUZETTE
Yes, madam Suzette knows all about 
it.

She is a French woman. She is pleased.

SUZETTE
Madam is beautiful this morning.

As Grusinskaya hurries Suzette to the door she says:

GRUSINSKAYA
Yes, Suzette.

Suzette goes out. Quickly Grusinskaya crosses and flings 
open the bathroom door. The Baron comes out.

GRUSINSKAYA
You must go now.

As she speaks the telephone goes. She gives the telephone a 
dirty look. Telephone rings again. She pulls him across to 
the telephone.

GRUSINSKAYA
There -- it begins.

With a hand in his she lifts the telephone receiver and 
speaks.

GRUSINSKAYA
Hello -- hello -- Meierheim? Yes...

During this scene the Baron is touching her shoulder. A 
charming light moment. She continues to speak into telephone. 
His touch probably tickles her, she laughs -- quickly covers 
the receiver so that Meierheim will not hear her laugh.

GRUSINSKAYA
(to Baron)
No --

During this scene she is listening to Meierheim. She frowns 
suddenly --

GRUSINSKAYA
What?... Cancel Vienna?... Are you 
mad? We always have great success in 
Vienna... Certainly not. Come here 
and see me... yes... good-bye.

She turns to the Baron and their arms go around each other.

The telephone rings again.

GRUSINSKAYA
(quickly)
There -- the day begins... I must go 
to rehearsal.

She lets the telephone ring.

BARON
Grusinskaya --

GRUSINSKAYA
Yes.

BARON
You do believe that I really love 
you?

GRUSINSKAYA
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd 
die after last night.

BARON
I want to be good to you -- madly 
good.

GRUSINSKAYA
Suzette will be back here in a minute.

BARON
I'll go -- good-bye.

GRUSINSKAYA
Shall I see you again?

BARON
I --

Telephone bell rings again.

GRUSINSKAYA
Suzette will be back here any minute.

BARON
When are you leaving Berlin?

GRUSINSKAYA
Very early in the morning.

BARON
For Vienna?

GRUSINSKAYA
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you 
come too -- I think it would be better -- 
for us -- for us both.

BARON
Oh -- yes but -- later.

GRUSINSKAYA
Why later?

BARON
I have no money now -- I must get 
some first -- I must get some.

GRUSINSKAYA
I'll give you what you need -- I 
have money.

BARON
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. 
I'll -- I will manage somehow -- 
I'll manage myself. I will go with 
you. When does the train leave?

GRUSINSKAYA
Six twenty-seven in the morning... 
But the money?

BARON
Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a 
whole day. I'll be on that train.

They move towards the door.

GRUSINSKAYA
I shall dance and you'll be with me 
and then -- listen -- After that you 
will come with me to Lake Como, I 
have a villa there. The sun will be 
shining. I will take a vacation -- 
six weeks -- eight weeks. We'll be 
happy and lazy. And then you will go 
with me to South America -- oh!

Telephone starts ringing.

GRUSINSKAYA
You must go now. Be careful on your 
way to your room.

BARON
I'll go. -- I love you.
(he kisses her)
I'll be on that train. I'll get the 
money.

She holds him back. The telephone is ringing.

GRUSINSKAYA
Don't do anything foolish -- I'm 
alarmed about you.

BARON
Don't worry. I'll be on the train.
(he kisses her)
He leaves.

Alone with the telephone bell ringing, Grusinskaya breathes 
deeply, stretches herself. She goes to the glass and looks 
at herself -- smiling. Happily she takes the pearls, kisses 
them, drops them into the casket -- picks up the telephone.

GRUSINSKAYA
(speaking into 
telephone)
Yes, Pimenov... Yes... where are 
you, in your room? Come, I will see 
you now... hurry.

She rises from the telephone flutteringly, she is humming a 
tune. She crosses to the mirror, pulls back her hair happily, 
she is indeed younger.

Suzette is putting out a dark dress.

GRUSINSKAYA
Not that dark dress -- something 
light -- bright -- it's a sunny 
morning, Suzette.

Suzette happily glances at her.

There is a knock at the door.

GRUSINSKAYA
Come in.
(sings)

Pimenov enters, before he can speak --

GRUSINSKAYA
Good morning, Pimenov.

PIMENOV
(a little puzzled at 
change in her)
Good morning, Gru -- your --

Before he can start speaking of last night she quickly speaks:

GRUSINSKAYA
Pimenov, I have an idea -- a new 
ballet -- it must have mad music -- 
I'll explain it to you later. But 
now, hurry to the theatre -- I want 
full rehearsal -- properties -- full 
ballet and some musicians. Hurry -- 
Quickly. I will be there --

During this scene Grusinskaya has not looked at him, she is 
busy in the glass. Nice photography on hair and face.

Side scene between Suzette and Pimenov, as Suzette shows him 
the cigarette case on the table.

As he goes through the door Grusinskaya crosses and almost 
sweeps Suzette to the door with him.

PIMENOV
Gru -- you are positively radiant.

GRUSINSKAYA
Yes, Pimenov.
(quickly to Suzette)
One minute, Suzette, I will call 
you.

They leave.

Grusinskaya shuts the door. She sweeps happily to the 
telephone.

GRUSINSKAYA
(very very softly - 
her voice is like 
music to operator)
Hello -- will you -- will you get me 
Baron von Gaigern, please... yes... 
Baron von Gaigern -- yes...

While she waits, she moves with a sense of dance.

GRUSINSKAYA
(again into telephone)
Will you get me Baron von Gaigern, 
please...
(she speaks quietly)
Cherie... yes... it is you... 
nothing... good morning, good morning, 
cherie... nothing... no... just to 
tell you I'm happy.

FADE OUT SLOWLY:

Bring music up.

END OF SEQUENCE "#3"

SEQUENCE "#4"

EXT. HOTEL - SIGN

Music effect over sign "Grand Hotel." Precisely the same 
angle as before. The sign lights.

DISSOLVE TO:

LOBBY - BY SENF'S DESK

The music comes up on the DISSOLVE into the original key 
shot of the lobby.

Senf is busy.

The Baron's chauffeur is standing impatiently by his desk. 
Business ad lib of Senf. He turns to the chauffeur who is 
barring the way of an important looking alien.

SENF
Step back please.

Chauffeur makes no effort to move. Against the normal busy, 
happy traffic of the evening he is a sinister figure. He 
does not move but glares at Senf.

SENF
I've told you three times -- Baron 
von Gaigern is out.

CHAUFFEUR
Did he leave any message for me?

SENF
No, he did not -- there is no message.

This whole scene is played in a very low key, almost in a 
whisper, it is interrupted by the entrance of the Doctor.

DOCTOR
(to Senf)
Any letters?

SENF
No, doctor.

During this short scene the chauffeur saunters off.

Kringelein comes to the doctor.

KRINGELEIN
Oh, Doctor, such a day -- such a 
day!

They move away from the scene.

Kringelein's voice diminishes as the CAMERA MOVES following 
the chauffeur.

The chauffeur saunters unthoughtfully past the florist shop 
and out of the door. As we pass the florist shop we see the 
back of the Baron in the shot.

CAMERA PANS chauffeur out to door. He has not seen the Baron 
in the florist shop. THE CAMERA PANS back to florist shop 
waits for the Baron who emerges carrying his usual box of 
orchids. CAMERA FOLLOWS BARON back to Senf's desk. Key shot.

BARON
(to Senf)
Madam Grusinskaya.

SENF
(taking the flowers 
and handing them to 
clerk)
For Madam Grusinskaya.

CLERK
(to page boy)
Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --

SENF
(to Baron)
Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.

BARON
(Quickly -- shortly)
All right.
(he glances around 
apprehensively)

Kringelein is speaking to the doctor.

The Baron approaches them.

KRINGELEIN
Baron, we must have gone a hundred 
miles an hour, at least...

BARON
Yes, quite.

KRINGELEIN
(to doctor)
We've been together all day... and 
in an aeroplane.

DOCTOR
Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.

KRINGELEIN
Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best 
shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, 
silk -- feels so nice on the skin... 
a London hat, see -- made in England, 
that's silk, too -- fifty marks... 
Look, the price is on it. That was 
half my salary before. The Baron is 
a very fine gentleman -- no one in 
my life has been so nice to me as 
the Baron.

The Baron smiles. He slaps his gauntlets on his dusty coat.

BARON
I'm going to change and we'll meet 
for a drink in the Yellow Room.

KRINGELEIN
In the Yellow Room, where the music's 
playing and the ladies are?

BARON
(amused)
Where the music's playing and the 
ladies are...

The Baron leaves.

DOCTOR
No pain, Mr. Kringelein?

KRINGELEIN
Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I 
had pain I'd be too happy to notice 
it...

NOTE: Find cut here.

While Kringelein is talking, they move away from the CAMERA.

CUT TO:

FLASH OF BARON'S ROOM

The Baron enters, throws his gloves down on the bed, turns 
up the light, picks up a piece of paper that's been pushed 
under the door, glances at it.

FLASH INSERT OF THE PAPER

In scrawl: "I HAVE BEEN WAITING ALL DAY. WILL BE OUTSIDE OR 
AT THE GARAGE." "S"

CUT BACK TO:

BARON

We again see the apprehension on the Baron's face. He crosses, 
closes the window. As he does so we hear the noise from the 
conference room.

Bring up noise from the conference room.

CUT TO:

CONFERENCE ROOM

We must have the feeling that these men have been arguing 
all day. Cognac bottles, cigar ends, selzer water, remains 
of some sandwiches. In other words it is a business 
battlefield. Preysing is drawn and tired. Zinnowitz is on 
his feet. Flaemmchen is fast asleep in her chair, making a 
pretty picture.

ZINNOWITZ
...and let me say again for the tenth 
time...
(he is hoarse and 
tired)
...you people were quite ready for 
the merger. You declared yourselves... 
fully agreed on all the terms -- Why 
should the signing of these articles 
be suddenly held up?

GERSTENKORN
I've admitted that at one time we 
had reason for desiring ther merger -- 
What reason have we now? The Preysing 
Company has fallon upon evil days, 
very evil days.

Preysing jumps to his feet.

PREYSING
Evil days -- I've shown you here --
(he bangs the paper)
-- my company exports to the Balkans 
alone, sixty-five thousand marks 
worth of mop rags a year.

GERSTENKORN
Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're 
interested in something quite 
different!

PREYSING
What?

SCHWEIMANN
(to Gerstenkorn -- 
with a sigh)
Shall I tell them again?

GERSTENKORN
(glancing at his watch)
Why waste time -- it's getting late.

SCHWEIMANN
You see -- what we are interested in --

GERSTENKORN
(interrupting)
Ah, come on -- we're going home.

Due to the long tedious session the men's collars are wilted.

ZINNOWITZ
(rising)
Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a 
regard for certainties...

GERSTENKORN
You've talked enough today, you're 
hoarse now.

IMPORTANT CLOSEUP OF PREYSING

His hand goes to his pocket. Slowly he takes out the telegram 
and glances at it. The following scene is played over this 
closeup.

GERSTENKORN
Sorry, Preysing.
(he gets his hat)

PREYSING
(nervously)
You've decided against the merger?

GERSTENKORN
Yes --

PREYSING
Then, it's all over?

GERSTENKORN
Yes --

WAITZ
(to Zinnowitz)
Well -- well -- You could call my 
office.

There is a general movement to go.

FLASH OF TELEGRAM

Trembling in Preysing's hand. "DEAL WITH MANCHESTER DEFINITELY 
OFF."

GENERAL SHOT OF ROOM

Gerstenkorn crosses to Preysing.

GERSTENKORN
Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull 
through. This is a very bad time to 
be in such a crisis. We've...

PREYSING
(interrupting)
Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- 
it's finished. You've broken off 
negotiations. You did it. You're 
calling them off. You had nothing on 
your mind all day, but Manchester, -- 
Manchester -- Manchester.
(he develops almost a 
passion)
You don't suppose for one moment 
that I'm such a fool as not to have 
something that I could say definitely 
about Manchester.
(he is generating 
almost a passion)

GERSTENKORN
What?

PREYSING
Oh no -- no -- the session is over. 
Let's go, it's off. Thank you, 
gentlemen.
(he starts packing up 
his papers.)

GERSTENKORN
If you actually have news from 
Manchester then...

PREYSING
Gentlemen, I am now free to 
announce...
(he is perspiring, 
his hands are 
trembling)
...that the deal between my firm and 
the Manchester Cotton Company has 
been successfully negotiated.

GERSTENKORN
Preysing, you're joking with us.

SCHWEIMANN
You're a deep one.

QUICK CLOSEUP OF ZINNOWITZ 

GENERAL SHOT OF ROOM

GERSTENKORN
In that case give us the articles. 
We'll sign at once. We know all the 
details...

PREYSING
(smiling, slowly folds 
up the telegram and 
puts it back in his 
pocket)
I thought we'd suspended negotiations, 
gentlemen.

GERSTENKORN
Under these circumstances it's quite 
a different matter.

PREYSING
Under these circumstances we might 
refuse to sign.

By this time, Waitz and Zinnowitz have the articles out upon 
the table.

Preysing is perspiring.

Gerstenkorn puts his arms around Preysing's shoulders.

GERSTENKORN
Come on -- business is business -- 
Come on --

Preysing stands, looking ahead of him.

Gerstenkorn picks up the papers glances at them, looks at 
Waitz.

Flaemmchen is awakening.

GERSTENKORN
Here's my signature -- here Preysing, 
sign here.

ZINNOWITZ
What a session this has been.

While Preysing is signing.

SCHWEIMANN
It's twenty-five to six.

WAITZ
We should celebrate this with a bottle 
of wine.

GERSTENKORN
(with his hat and 
coat)
See you soon, Preysing. Next week 
we'll meet and discuss further 
details.

PREYSING
Next week.

Hasty hand-shaking, business of exits.

Waitz, Gerstenkorn and Schweimann out.

Preysing has not moved.

Zinnowitz takes the agreement and waves it in the air to dry 
the signature.

PREYSING
(to himself)
Next week.

ZINNOWITZ
You let me talk till I'm hoarse and 
you had Manchester sewed-up all the 
time. Why?

Preysing does not answer.

Zinnowitz amiably shrugs his shoulders.

ZINNOWITZ
Well -- the deal has been put through.

Preysing commences to laugh suddenly with increasing violence.

PREYSING
Yes, it has been put through -- it 
has been put through.

During this scene, Flaemmchen has risen, piled up her papers, 
glanced at her watch. During this action Flaemmchen motions 
to Zinnowitz that she is going down to dance, etc., Preysing 
is unaware of this action. Flaemmchen leaves the room trying 
not to attract attention.

ZINNOWITZ
(to Preysing)
What's the matter with you?

PREYSING
(hysterically)
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.

ZINNOWITZ
What's bluff?

PREYSING
(throwing the telegram 
on the table)
That.

ZINNOWITZ
(reading at out loud)
'Deal with Manchester definitely 
off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have 
thought it of you.

PREYSING
No one would have thought it of me. 
I've been getting rusty in 
Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what 
the world wants I guess I can put up 
as big a bluff as anyone. From now 
on...
(he turns away)

ZINNOWITZ
You must go to Manchester at once 
yourself and really see it through.

PREYSING
Yes -- I must go to England -- I was 
desperate -- Now I don't care -- 
This sort of thing goes to a man's 
head.

ZINNOWITZ
What you need is some relaxation.

PREYSING
Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd 
like to tear loose -- I'd like a 
drink. I'd like to go down to that 
dancing place. I'd like to start 
something.

ZINNOWITZ
I can understand that -- after your -- 
uh --

PREYSING
Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's 
the first time in thirty years that 
I've ever... Where's that 
stenographer? Miss Flaemm...

ZINNOWITZ
What do you want with her?

PREYSING
I want to see her, I want to do some 
dictating -- report of the conference 
for my father-in-law.

ZINNOWITZ
She had an engagement in the Yellow 
Room at five o'clock -- she was in a 
hurry.

PREYSING
Zinnowitz, would you say she was 
pretty?

ZINNOWITZ
Pretty as a picture.

PREYSING
Let's go down and find her -- I need 
a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.
(he is picking up 
papers)
I don't know anything about women -- 
been married for twenty-six years.

ZINNOWITZ
Bluff does it, Preysing, bluff does 
it. Goodnight.

Preysing is very excited, they start to leave -- at that 
moment the telephone rings.

PREYSING
Aeh!

He crosses to the telephone.

PREYSING
(into telephone)
Hello... Father-in-law?... Is that 
you?... The agreement is signed -- I 
did it... yes, father-in-law... but 
now I must go to Manchester.

When he picks the telephone up his hands are shaking -- 

DISSOLVE HANDS INTO:

COCKTAIL SHAKER

-- which shakes more. Music crashes up --

DISSOLVE OUT:

DISSOLVE INTO BAR

Kringelein and the Doctor are just entering. Kringelein is 
changed. His hair has been cut short and his moustache is 
gone, he looks almost saucy.

DOCTOR
(to barman)
Barman -- whiskey --
(to Kringelein)
For you, Mr. Kringelein?

KRINGELEIN
For me? -- Oh, please, something 
sweet and cold.

BARMAN
A Louisiana flip, sir?

KRINGELEIN
A Louisiana flip, that sounds very 
nice -- sweet, eh? --

During the following speech Kringelein keeps reaching for 
the moustache that is not there. He is thoroughly happy.

DOCTOR
What do you do in the Grand Hotel? 
Eat -- sleep -- loaf around -- do 
business -- flirt a little -- dance 
a little. A hundred doors to one 
hall and nobody knows anything about 
the person next to him. When you 
leave another takes your room and 
lies in your bed -- the end.

At that moment Flaemmchen enters.

FLAEMMCHEN
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- 
Where's the Baron?

KRINGELEIN
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron 
and I have been together all day. A 
hundred miles an hour -- in a motor 
car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was 
marvelous --

FLAEMMCHEN
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have 
changed, you look so nice.

KRINGELEIN
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, 
please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, 
Miss Flaemm, won't you have something 
sweet -- a Louisiana flip.
(to barman)
A Louisiana flip.

FLAEMMCHEN
(to barman)
No - absinthe.

KRINGELEIN
(amazed)
Yes -- that --

Kringelein is beating time to the music -- a little carried 
away.

Flaemmchen laughs.

FLAEMMCHEN
You like music?

KRINGELEIN
Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man 
might --

FLAEMMCHEN
(mischievously)
A man might what?

KRINGELEIN
I don't know -- I'd like to do 
anything --

FLAEMMCHEN
(very quietly)
Oh -- you would!

The Baron enters quickly.

BARON
(to Flaemmchen)
Hello -- sorry I'm late.

KRINGELEIN
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- 
A Louisiana flip?

BARON
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you 
feel now?

KRINGELEIN
A little strange, Baron.

FLAEMMCHEN
I'd given you up.

BARON
(to Flaemmchen)
Sorry.

KRINGELEIN
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?

BARON
No thanks -- keeping my head clear.

FLAEMMCHEN
Dance then?
(they exit)

KRINGELEIN
(to Doctor)
She's beautiful -- isn't she?

DOCTOR
(to Kringelein)
Oh -- there are plenty of women.

BARON AND FLAEMMCHEN DANCING

FLAEMMCHEN
What have you been doing all day?

BARON
Chasing around.

FLAEMMCHEN
Chasing what?

BARON
Money.

They dance a few steps, in silence.

FLAEMMCHEN
You were very different yesterday.

BARON
Yesterday -- yes -- that was 
yesterday.

They dance into the crowd.

CUT BACK TO:

BAR

DOCTOR
Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting 
what you're looking for?

KRINGELEIN
What, Doctor?

DOCTOR
A masculine paradise -- drink, the 
ladies, dancing...

KRINGELEIN
I had a very good opportunity, a 
young lady asked me to dance -- I 
ought to be able to dance, it seems 
to be very important.

DOCTOR
You must learn as quickly as your 
time allows -- Believe me Mr. 
Kringelein, a man who isn't with a 
woman is a dead man.

KRINGELEIN
Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you 
anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you 
all alone in the world.

DOCTOR
(quietly)
I'm always alone -- I have been 
everything.

KRINGELEIN
Everything?

DOCTOR
I was sent as a military surgeon to 
South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken 
prisoner. Home on parole not to fight. 
I was a surgeon in the Great War 
till the end. Grenade in the face. 
Carried diphtheria bacilli in the 
wound until 1920. Isolated two years.
(pause)
I've been everything.

The music has stopped.

CUT TO:

BARON AND FLAEMMCHEN ON DANCE FLOOR

FLAEMMCHEN
That was lovely.

BARON
Will you do me a big favor?

FLAEMMCHEN
I'll do anything for you.

BARON
Would you like to make a man happy?

FLAEMMCHEN
(quietly)
Yes -- I'd love to.

BARON
Then dance the next number with 
Kringelein.

FLAEMMCHEN
Why?

BARON
I feel sorry for him.

FLAEMMCHEN
You're not a bit like you were 
yesterday.

BARON
I fell in love last night -- the 
real thing.

FLAEMMCHEN
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it 
doesn't exist.

BARON
I thought that, too -- but I found 
that it does. Come along, dance with 
Kringelein.

FLAEMMCHEN
Anything for you.

They move off. As they approach the bar, happily Preysing 
pushes into scene, touches Flaemmchen's arm.

PREYSING
Miss Flaemm.

FLAEMMCHEN
Hello!

PREYSING
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.

FLAEMMCHEN
(with the Baron)
Presently, Mr. Preysing.

PREYSING
It's urgent.

BARON
Pardon me, the lady has urgent 
business here with me.

PREYSING
(to himself)
Insolent -- Berlin manners.

At that moment Kringelein has descended from the stool and 
crosses to Preysing.

KRINGELEIN
I wish you a very good evening, Mr. 
Preysing. You are staying here, too, 
Mr. Preysing?

PREYSING
I don't know you.

KRINGELEIN
Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein 
at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper, 
building C, room twenty-three -- 
third floor.

FLAEMMCHEN
(quickly)
Come and dance with me, Mr. 
Kringelein.

PREYSING
I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- 
business.

FLAEMMCHEN
(lightly)
Tomorrow morning.

PREYSING
No -- now.

FLAEMMCHEN
Do you gentlemen know each other, 
Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Preysing -- 
Baron von Gaigern.

They bow stiffly.

PREYSING
Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend 
and not accept your invitation to 
dance.

KRINGELEIN
I could not think of not accepting.

PREYSING
You say that you are employed by us 
in Fredersdorf, and here you are in 
Berlin, indulging in diversions which 
ill befit your position and which 
are very much beyond your means -- 
Quite extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein, 
I think we will look into your books.

Kringelein stands watching Preysing, his eyes narrowing.

FLAEMMCHEN
Now, children, no fighting -- save 
that for the office. Let's have our 
dance.
(her arms go around 
Kringelein. They 
dance off)

PREYSING
I'll remember you, Mr. Kringelein.

BARON
Oh, let the poor devil alone.

PREYSING
I did not ask your advice.

The two men eye each other; for a moment there might be a 
fight.

BARON
I think it would be much better if 
you went away.

PREYSING
We shall see who remains here the 
longer.

BARON
(shrugging his 
shoulders)
As you will.

Preysing leans against the bar, orders a cognac. The Baron 
turns his back to him, watching the dancing.

CUT TO:

FAEMMCHEN AND KRINGELEIN ON FLOOR

FLAEMMCHEN
You must look at my face and not at 
the floor.

KRINGELEIN
Yes.

FLAEMMCHEN
You're trembling.

KRINGELEIN
I never danced before -- in public.

FLAEMMCHEN
You dance splendidly.

KRINGELEIN
I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.

FLAEMMCHEN
Really?

KRINGELEIN
For the first time in my life, I'm 
happy.

Kringelein shows signs of exhaustion.

Flaemmchen watches him quickly.

FLAEMMCHEN
Let's stop -- I'm tired.

It is obvious that she has stopped because of Kringelein's 
distress.

KRINGELEIN
Thank you, Miss Flaemm.

They move back to the bar. Preysing catches Flaemmchen's 
arm.

PREYSING
Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.

KRINGELEIN
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?

PREYSING
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.

KRINGELEIN
Does the world belong to you, Mr. 
Preysing?

PREYSING
What is this insolence?

KRINGELEIN
Do you think you have free license 
to be insulting? Believe me you have 
not. You think you're superior, but 
you're quite an ordinary man.

PREYSING
Go away -- go away.

FLAEMMCHEN
Please -- please!

KRINGELEIN
You don't like to see me enjoying 
myself.

PREYSING
Who are you? -- An embezzler most 
likely.

KRINGELEIN
An embezzler -- you're going to take 
that back, right here in the presence 
of this young lady -- who do you 
think you're talking to? You think 
I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot 
dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate 
Preysing.

PREYSING
You're discharged.

KRINGELEIN
Me?

PREYSING
Yes you -- shut your mouth -- get 
out -- you're discharged.

Kringelein's hat has fallen from the stool upon the floor. 
Flaemmchen picks it up, brushes it.

Kringelein starts to laugh.

The Baron steps into the scene.

The Doctor slowly comes from the bar.

KRINGELEIN
You can't discharge me -- I'm my own 
master now -- at last. I'm ill, I'm 
going to die -- do you understand? 
I'm going to die very soon. Nothing 
can happen to me now. Nobody can do 
anything any more to me. By the time 
you can have discharged me I shall 
have been dead already.
(his laugh becomes a 
convulsive sob)

The Baron steps between the two looking straight into 
Preysing's face.

DOCTOR
Come, Mr. Kringelein.
(he pulls him out of 
the scene towards 
the bar)

PREYSING
(his fists clenched, 
between his teeth)
The man's insane -- he acts as if he 
is glad he is going to die...
(hesitates -- to 
Flaemmchen)
I shall see you in the lobby in half 
an hour.

END SEQUENCE "#4"

SEQUENCE "#5"

FADE IN:

KEY SHOT OF LOBBY OVER SENF'S HEAD

General activity.

The house detective, later identified, is talking to the 
chauffeur. He leaves the chauffeur and crosses to Senf.

HOUSE DETECTIVE
Better let him stay -- I've sent for 
the Baron... How's your wife coming 
along?

SENF
I was at the hospital all night 
walking up and down the corridor. 
They wouldn't let me in to see her. 
She has the pains, but the child 
doesn't come and I have to stay here 
chained to this desk.

HOUSE DETECTIVE
It will be all right.

SENF
I hope so.

At that moment Preysing enters.

PREYSING
Did you send that page?

SENF
The young lady's there, sir.

Preysing glances off to see Flaemmchen standing looking 
around.

Preysing crosses to Flaemmchen.

FLAEMMCHEN
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?

PREYSING
Sit here.
(calls to a boy)
Cognac -- for you?

FLAEMMCHEN
Nothing.

At that moment the Baron and Kringelein pass.

Preysing glances up at Kringelein as he passes.

PREYSING
I'm going to keep an eye on that 
Kringelein fellow. I'll find out 
where he gets the money to hang around 
the Grand Hotel.

FLAEMMCHEN
Well -- you want me?

PREYSING
(looks straight at 
her)
Yes.

FLAEMMCHEN
Well?

PREYSING
I must go to England -- at once.

FLAEMMCHEN
Well?

PREYSING
You see, I'd like to take a secretary 
with me for my correspondence and --
humm -- humm -- for company on the 
trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- 
I don't know if you quite understand 
me. You said you have travelled with 
gentlemen -- and I mean --

FLAEMMCHEN
I understand perfectly.

PREYSING
What do you think your salary would 
be -- for such a trip?

FLAEMMCHEN
Wait -- I must figure it up.
(she smokes and thinks)
First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- 
it's cold in England in March, I'll 
need a suit... You'd want me to look 
nice?

PREYSING
Of course -- of course.
(he is fidgeting)

FLAEMMCHEN
A thousand marks --
(she waits anxiously 
thinking it might be 
too much)

PREYSING
It's agreed -- I will get a room 
here for you.

She is looking away.

PREYSING
I can get a room here in the Grand 
Hotel for you.

She still looks away.

PREYSING
Can you pay some attention to me?

FLAEMMCHEN
Oh, yes.

PREYSING
(looking off)
Insolent young cub!

FLAEMMCHEN
You mean Baron von Gaigern?

PREYSING
Baron!

FLAEMMCHEN
Well, he's a gentleman!

THE BARON

Who is leaning against a chair by a pillar with Kringelein.

THE CAMERA APPROACHES THEM.

They are not speaking. The Baron is looking off at:

FLASH A SHOT FROM HIS ANGLE OF CHAUFFEUR

Sauntering between the door and Senf's desk.

BACK TO:

THE BARON

He slumps on the arm of the chair.

KRINGELEIN
(watching him)
The Baron is tired?

BARON
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --
(he shrugs his 
shoulders)
Well -- well --

KRINGELEIN
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could 
go to the Casino -- the place we 
passed with the marvelous bright 
lights?

BARON
I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- 
I am broke!

KRINGELEIN
Broke -- A Baron? But, Baron --

The Baron looks off, sees the chauffeur --

CUT IN:

FLASH OF CHAUFFEUR

Arguing with Senf.

CUT BACK TO:

BARON

BARON
Excuse me, Mr. Kringelein.
(he strides off)

Keep the CAMERA on Kringelein as he watches the Baron.

He takes out his pocket-book and looks at his money commencing 
to count it. The thought is in his mind of offering the Baron 
money. Charming scene.

CUT TO:

BARON AND CHAUFFEUR

Moving into position. They are talking.

BARON
(quietly)
I've quit.

CHAUFFEUR
You can't.

BARON
I'm not going to get those pearls 
and neither are you.

CHAUFFEUR
What about the money?

BARON
I'll pay you back.

CHAUFFEUR
How?

BARON
I have an idea working in my head...
(he glances at 
Kringelein)

CHAUFFEUR
You might find a bullet through that 
head...

BARON
If you did that, you'd get nothing 
except the police after you. If you 
wait -- I'll give you your six 
thousand back --

At that moment a voice is heard.

VOICE
Madam Grusinskaya's car -- Madam 
Grusinskaya's car.

It is passed along.

INSIDE PORTER
(calls through his 
little telephone)
Madam Grusinskaya's car --

MEGAPHONE
(outside)
Madam Grusinskaya's car --

BARON
(quickly to chauffeur)
Later.
(Chauffeur exits with 
bad grace.)

Baron looks off...

FULL SHOT -- FROM HIS ANGLE

Like a pageant Grusinskaya sweeps forward -- pretty shot. 
Music comes up.

Grusinskaya is followed by Suzette, Pimenov and Meierheim. 
People turn to look at her. She sweeps forward.

As she gets to the door she faces the Baron. She steps quickly 
aside to him. Pimenov and Meierheim pause.

GRUSINSKAYA
(to them)
Go on please -- go on, Suzette.

She and the Baron are alone.

BARON
(quietly)
Bless you...

GRUSINSKAYA
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- 
I shall dance tonight -- How I shall 
dance -- I want to feel that you are 
in the theatre.

BARON
I can't.

GRUSINSKAYA
No?

BARON
No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- 
the pearls. You wear them now...

GRUSINSKAYA
Why do you think --

BARON
Why?

GRUSINSKAYA
They've brought me such good luck -- 
you --

He takes her hand, kisses it quietly.

GRUSINSKAYA
I'm worried about you.

BARON
Don't.

GRUSINSKAYA
On the train?

BARON
Yes -- I will be on the train.

GRUSINSKAYA
Till then.

BARON
Bless you --

During this scene Kringelein has been hovering nearby. As 
Grusinskaya turns away and exits, Kringelein approaches the 
Baron, who is standing perfectly still, looking off, -- his 
mind miles away.

KRINGELEIN
Was the Baron joking, or is it really 
true that the Baron is -- in financial 
straits.

BARON
(lightly)
Absolutely true, Kringelein and I 
have to raise some money immediately.

KRINGELEIN
If the Baron -- if you would permit 
me --

The Baron looks at him suddenly.

BARON
What?

KRINGELEIN
I would be awfully glad to oblige, 
you've been so decent to me. Three 
hundred?

BARON
If I could get into a game I might 
win some.

KRINGELEIN
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over 
six thousand eight hundred marks 
with me.

BARON
If we could scare up some men to 
play.

KRINGELEIN
We could come to my room.

BARON
(with enthusiasm)
Good!

At that moment Flaemmchen passes.

BARON
Going?

FLAEMMCHEN
Yes --

Flaemmchen hesitates as though she wanted to say something 
that is on her mind.

A curious little scene.

She doesn't speak, she just turns suddenly through the door. 
The Baron glances after her a little puzzled, turns back to 
Kringelein.

BARON
Ready, Kringelein?

KRINGELEIN
Ready, Baron.

They move off and are last in the crowd.

FADE OUT:

END OF SEQUENCE "#5"

SEQUENCE "#6"

No scenes 88-93 inclusive

Sequence omitted from original script.

DISSOLVE INTO:

KRINGELEIN'S ROOM

Possibly ten men are gathered about a green table. They are 
playing cards. There are champagne bottles, glasses, etc., 
on the table -- a great deal of smoke. Good atmosphere. The 
game is [...] fer. There is a dead silence except for the 
monotonous words of the players.

White faced, the Baron has the bank.

Otternschlag is seen to close the door quietly and approach 
the table.

Kringelein's back is to us.

They are smart people, not professional gamblers.

There is a tension in the room. The men are gathered around 
tightly. We do not see the cards.

The following voices are heard:

BARON'S VOICE
All right, gentlemen.

VOICES
I play -- I play -- Here -- Up -- 
Playing --

KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
Yes -- me.

Several men glance at Kringelein and the size of his stake.

KRINGELEIN
Is that too much, Baron?

BARON
(glances down at his 
own money)
No -- not at all.

KRINGELEIN
All right then.

BARON
All right then.

There is tension in the room. The Baron deals two cards. 
Kringelein takes cards.

A MAN
(quickly)
Don't show them.

Kringelein turns it down. He is like a little boy learning a 
new game.

The Baron deals himself a card.

KRINGELEIN
(to Baron)
What do I do now?

The Baron is serious. There is enough money on the table to 
take him to Vienna.

A MAN
(next to Kringelein)
Turn 'em up.

KRINGELEIN
Oh yes -- that's right -- look! I 
win, don't I --
(he turns the card up)

The Baron rises.

BARON
There you are gentlemen.

A MAN
(to Kringelein)
Will you take the bank, sir?

KRINGELEIN
Yes -- I'll take everything gentlemen -- 
please, let us drink -- champagne ---
champagne is expensive and good. I'm 
winning more than I used to earn in 
a year -- double what I used to earn.
(he is counting his 
money)

They hand him the cards.

Kringelein kisses the Baron -- he looks around.

KRINGELEIN
Where is the Baron -- where are you, 
Baron?

At the side table the Baron is standing -- he is drinking -- 
his face is white -- he has lost.

KRINGELEIN
(rising quickly)
Excuse me, gentlemen.

DOCTOR
(sitting down in 
Kringelein's place)
I'll take the bank -- All right, 
gentlemen.

Kringelein has come to the Baron.

BARON
That was my last.

KRINGELEIN
You've lost everything?

BARON
I've no luck.

KRINGELEIN
Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again...
(he puts bills in 
Baron's hand.)

Baron pours out a glass of champagne -- he has been drinking 
plenty -- he hands glass to Kringelein.

BARON
Drink to me, Kringelein -- it's my 
last chance.

KRINGELEIN
(earnestly)
I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you, 
Baron and to win.
(he drinks)
It's good, -- come along, Baron.

They both move back to the table where the Doctor holds the 
bank.

BARON
I take five hundred.

KRINGELEIN
All of that at once, Baron?

The Baron picks cards, shows them to Kringelein who doesn't 
understand.

BARON
Eight.
(he is triumphant.)

DOCTOR'S VOICE
(rings in background)
Nine.

The Baron throws the cards into the middle of the table and 
turns to Kringelein:

BARON
That's it. The luck's with you.
(he walks away.)

VOICES
Come along, Mr. Kringelein. Sit here.

KRINGELEIN
I'm having luck for the first time 
in my life.

A MAN
Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.

Kringelein seats himself, puts his glass of champagne down 
on the table.

Doctor leaves table, crosses to Baron who is pouring another 
drink.

DOCTOR
Out, Baron?

BARON
(bitterly)
For a while -- I'll recover -- in 
ten or twenty years.
(he points)
Look at that.

He has pointed and turned off because we hear Kringelein's 
voice:

KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
I've won again, Baron -- I've won 
again.

Baron moves out of scene followed by Doctor. As Baron 
approaches table.

KRINGELEIN
Baron, I drink and win -- I drink 
and win -- I win and drink!
(he is pulling money 
towards him, counting 
it, eagerly, 
frantically, not the 
movement of a miser, 
not a greedy movement, 
but the movement of 
an excited child 
liberated. Money has 
become so much mad 
paper to him.)

During the foregoing scene, one of the men at the table has 
answered the ringing of the telephone bell, he comes back 
now.

A MAN
There are complaints in the hotel 
about the noise.

VOICES
What time is it? Getting late? Let's 
break it up!
(to Kringelein)
You've been very lucky... Where's my 
coat? Let's go. He's drunk anyway!... 
Goodnight, Baron. Let's wind up the 
game, I'm broke and tired; you can't 
play against him. I put my hat down 
here, somewhere. I think I'll have a 
drink before I go. By the way, I've 
got to see you tomorrow morning. 
How've you been, Doctor?

Business ad lib. General business of slow normal exit.

Kringelein looks up from counting his money. He has been 
like a little boy with a Christmas stocking. He looks up 
suddenly, sees men are leaving --

KRINGELEIN
Oh, don't go, gentlemen! -- Stay a 
while.
(he stands to his 
feet)
Be my guests!

By this time the men are pausing by the door.

KRINGELEIN
I oughtn't to presume, but I --
(he is a little drunk)
I'm so grateful to you -- it's been 
so marvelous. The first time in my 
life I have gambled -- I've danced! 
Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but 
it's the first time in my life I've 
ever tasted life!

A MAN
(slapping him on back)
Splendid!

There is a general feeling in the room that although this 
man is drunk he is terribly sincere, and that there is no 
wish to embarrass themselves or him. In fact, there is a 
nervous impatient movement among the men. But Kringelein has 
reached an emotional pitch.

KRINGELEIN
Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but 
very dangerous. You must have courage 
for it, then it's wonderful. You 
gentlemen don't know that because 
you are all healthy and happy, but I -- 
believe me -- a man must know death 
and not until then does a man know 
anything about life.

A MAN
(sings)
Rejoice in life while yet the small 
lamp burns.

General noise among men, some are ribald, others are serious. 
Two men come and shake hands with Kringelein, bidding him 
goodnight.

The Baron puts his hand restrainingly on Kringelein's 
shoulder.

Kringelein almost staggers towards the sideboard. The men 
are nearing the door.

A MAN
(starts singing)
It's a short life and a gay one...

KRINGELEIN
(seizing a glass of 
champagne)
Every glass high to life -- the 
splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief --
brief life -- and the courage to 
live it.
(turns to Baron)
Baron, you know -- I've only lived 
since last night -- but that little 
while seems longer than all the time 
before -- all the --
(he collapses suddenly 
onto the floor)

Business ad lib.

The doctor is there quickly. The Baron next.

MAN
Drunk.

ANOTHER MAN
Poor fellow.

General normal business ad lib between the men. Perhaps three 
of them help him up, including the Baron. They carry 
Kringelein to the bed.

VOICES
(of players mingling)
Drunk? No, he's ill. Looks ill.
(well paused over:)
He's a doctor -- The doctor's here -- 
He's just drunk!

DOCTOR
Gentlemen, this man is ill -- very 
ill -- if you will leave.

VOICES
Certainly, Doctor. Goodnight! 
Goodnight, Baron! Bad luck!

DRUNKEN MAN
He's not used to champagne -- why 
does he drink it?

Little comedy on exit. Ad lib.

INTERCUT FOR RELIEF -- Kringelein's face -- white, drawn, 
tragic.

One man, perhaps, remains.

MAN
Can I help, doctor?

DOCTOR
No, the Baron will stay.

BARON
Certainly.

Man leaves. During this scene the Baron has been carefully 
making Kringelein comfortable on the bed, bolstering pillows 
behind his head. Kringelein's eyes are shut tightly, his 
hands are limp.

By the business of the Baron, although we do not of course 
know it, this is the time that he takes the wallet from 
Kringelein and puts it in his own pocket.

We might perhaps remember a sudden turn away in which we see 
his back and his right hand raised as though reaching in his 
inside pocket --

He stands looking down at Kringelein.

DOCTOR
(drops Kringelein's 
hand)
It will be over in a minute.

Kringelein's eyes flutter. His voice sounds hoarsely:

KRINGELEIN
Over -- over so soon -- it has just 
begun.
(he closes his eyes 
suddenly)
Oh, the pain.

DOCTOR
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be 
afraid.

KRINGELEIN
(mutteringly)
I'd like to live a little longer but -- 
I'm not afraid to die -- I'm not...

BARON
(touching his shoulder 
gently)
You'll be all right, Kringelein.
(he moves from the 
bed -- takes out a 
cigarette, moves to 
the table. He seizes 
his drink)

KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
(out of scene)
My pocketbook... my money in it...

DOCTOR'S VOICE
What do you say -- what?

We watch Baron's face, he looks back over his shoulder.

DOCTOR'S VOICE
You what -- Oh, isn't it there?

KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
No -- But no I -- Baron, I've lost 
my pocketbook.

Baron turns in this scene. He walks forward toward them.

The Doctor's hands are on Kringelein's coat.

DOCTOR
There is no pocketbook here... On 
the floor probably.
(He glances down)

KRINGELEIN
(starting up suddenly)
More than fourteen thousand marks... 
were in that pocketbook.

DOCTOR
(looking at Baron)
Fourteen thousand marks... One can 
travel -- one's happiness might depend 
on fourteen thousand marks -- don't 
you think so, Baron?

BARON
(with a shrug)
Quite possibly.

At that moment, Kringelein, who has been staring up at the 
ceiling, his hands clenching and reclenching, starts up.

KRINGELEIN
Oh, I've got to find it.

DOCTOR
Stay where you are.

KRINGELEIN
No -- I must find it --
(he starts talking)
Fourteen thousand two hundred marks.
(he pulls himself to 
the side of the bed)

The doctor goes to restrain him.

KRINGELEIN
I'm all right, Doctor. There's no 
pain now -- only you don't know what 
that money means to a man like me.

He is suddenly on his hands and knees, crawling along the 
floor, looking for it, like a little boy; his drunkenness, 
his condition, makes the situation tragic. He actually gets 
under the card table.

The Doctor looks at the Baron.

The Baron only watches Kringelein. He follows him, fascinated.

KRINGELEIN
(talking at intervals 
as he crawls looking 
for money)
You don't know, because you've never 
lived like a dog -- in a hole -- and 
saved and scrimped. My life hangs 
upon that money, Baron. Nobody gives 
you anything. You have to buy 
everything and pay cash for it. I 
wanted to pay for my last days with 
that money. Every hour costs money. 
I've nothing -- nothing but that 
pocketbook.
(he crawls along the 
floor on his hands 
and knees talking to 
the carpet as he 
looks)
I must have it back.
(he pauses breathless -- 
like an animal along 
the wall -- looking 
up at the men)

The foregoing speech is intercut with the following action 
in which Kringelein's voice is heard throughout -- thus it 
is not a long speech:

The Baron watches. He throws his cigarette away -- he bites 
his lip -- sweat breaks out upon his forehead; again he is a 
thief. When he wanted pearls the love of a woman stopped 
him. Now he wants this money and pity, a slow growing pity 
for this tragic, dying thing is stopping him -- and all the 
time the Doctor watches.

The one, whole eye pierces into the Baron's melting 
conscience.

Twice during the speech at a spot, through and during 
rehearsal, to be selected, the Doctor's voice, droning but 
piercing, says:

DOCTOR
He must find his money, Baron.
(next time)
Mr. Kringelein should find his 
pocketbook, Baron, shouldn't he?

These are two interjections.

And now, Kringelein lies upon the floor, a troubled little 
sack of pain, his head down.

The Baron turns away. He bends down as though he were looking 
for the pocketbook. We see him take it from his pocket and 
turn. There is a very light, almost triumphant ring in his 
voice as he says:

BARON
Here -- here it is. Here's your 
pocketbook, Kringelein.

KRINGELEIN
(his head coming up)
Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found 
it -- you found it for me, Baron.

BARON
(quickly)
Goodnight, Kringelein.
(he moves towards the 
door.)

KRINGELEIN
No -- no please -- oh, don't go -- 
don't go -- don't leave me alone, 
Baron.

DOCTOR
You've nothing to fear, Kringelein

KRINGELEIN
No.

BARON
Come, get up -- come let me help 
you.

NOTE: If he is a strong actor he can pick Kringelein up -- 
If not, he and Doctor lift Kringelein to bed.

BARON
You're all right now -- it's very 
late -- goodnight, Kringelein.

KRINGELEIN
Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.

Baron bites his lip. It is the first and only time in the 
play that we see a tear near -- the strong man almost breaks.

DOCTOR'S VOICE
Goodnight, Baron.

BARON
Goodnight.
(his hand presses on 
Kringelein's shoulder -- 
he exits)

CUT OUT INTO:

CORRIDOR

Baron shuts door and pauses. In front of him is the door of 
the woman he loves. Down beyond is his own empty room. In 
his pockets nothing. In his CLOSEUP he makes the audience 
feel his problem with him.

This man who has lived and whistled and love through the 
play becomes a tragic, lonely, harrassed figure. The Baron 
has broken. His fists dig into his eyes -- he brushes his 
hair back.

Over this comes with almost an impertinence, a tiny whistle. 
He looks up and away down the corridor. The figure of 
Flaemmchen stands there, a small black bag in her hand. The 
Baron pulls himself together and smiles characteristically. 
He walks down the corridor.

BARON
Flaemmchen, what are you doing here 
in the middle of the night.

FLAEMMCHEN
Looking for my room -- one sixty-
six.

BARON
You live here?

FLAEMMCHEN
For tonight.
(she points to door -- 
she looks at him a 
long time)

BARON
Oh!

FLAEMMCHEN
Yes -- oh!

BARON
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.

FLAEMMCHEN
And Baron, thanks so much for 
everything.

They both go into their respective rooms.

Here are our two gay young characters. The gay, fresh 
Flaemmchen and the debonair Baron, crucified for lack of 
funds. Both trying to smile, both trying to be light about 
themselves. Yet, each about to involve themselves tragically 
for the want of a little money.

FLAEMMCHEN'S ROOM

Flaemmchen enters her room cautiously. Except for one lamp 
burning the room is in darkness and empty. From the adjoining 
door to Preysing's room a thin stream of light. She puts 
down her bag quickly, tiptoes through the bathroom to his 
door. She peeps through.

CUT TO:

FLASH OF PREYSING'S ROOM

from her angle.

Preysing stretched on bed flat, his stomach a mountain and 
on it the magazine that he has been reading with Flaemmchen's 
picture. He is looking at the ceiling. She knows he is awake 
because a thin stream of smoke comes from his cigar in his 
hand.

FLASH OF FLAEMMCHEN

An idea occurs to her. She could possibly sneak into bed and 
he would go to sleep and there would be nothing that night.

CAMERA FOLLOWS HER as she tiptoes to her room. She closes 
the door noiselessly and listens. She throws off her hat and 
takes off her coat. Opens her bag and takes out night dress, 
lingerie, etc. The lid of her bag falls suddenly. She starts 
at the noise. "Has it awakened him." She looks off.

SHOT AT BATHROOM DOOR

The thin stream of light is filled suddenly, the door of the 
adjoining room opens and back-lighted from the other room 
the huge form of Preysing appears. In this odd lighting he 
is a little more than Preysing. He comes forward. He speaks 
hoarsely, quietly.

PREYSING
Flaemmchen!
(he seizes her to him)

She goes to his arms passively. He rubs his face in her hair. 
She is passive -- cold.

PREYSING
(breathlessly)
You are late. I've been waiting for 
you -- waiting.

FLAEMMCHEN
I had to arrange about the trip.

PREYSING
You're sweet.

FLAEMMCHEN
You think so?

He holds her again, trying to kiss her. She deliberately 
avoids his kiss.

PREYSING
(awkwardly)
Come here.
(he sits heavily on 
the bed, sitting on 
her night dress.)

FLAEMMCHEN
Here, hold up!

Preysing rises while she pulls her night dress from under 
him.

He draws her to him.

FLAEMMCHEN
Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.

PREYSING
Call me -- do you know -- would you -- 
would you like to call me by my first 
name?

FLAEMMCHEN
(pulling away, glad 
of an excuse for 
conversation)
Oh, no.

PREYSING
Why not?

FLAEMMCHEN
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger 
to me.

PREYSING
You're a funny little creature, 
Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.

FLAEMMCHEN
It's not funny at all. One can't get 
intimate just off hand. I could go 
to England with you and everything 
like that -- supposing I met you 
next year and I said: 'How do you 
do, Mr. Preysing! And you said:
(she imitates him)
'That was the young lady who was my 
secretary in Manchester'.

Preysing laughs. She laughs.

FLAEMMCHEN
That's all quite proper.
(she is happy again. 
She would rather 
talk than be squeezed)
But supposing I met you when you 
were with your wife and I called 
out: "Hello you big baby -- remember 
Manchester?' And you with your wife, 
how would you like that?

There is a pause for a moment.

PREYSING
Please, Flaemmchen -- we'll leave my 
wife out of this.

Flaemmchen yawns straight in his face.

FLAEMMCHEN
All right. I'll get undressed -- get 
out.

He moves towards the windows which are open. She pushes his 
fat body out, almost playfully, through the doors and onto 
the balcony.

Preysing stands out on the balcony. He looks down in the 
street below, then off. He starts suddenly because he sees a 
shadow over the railing of his own balcony. He is puzzled. 
Shadow crosses again. "Who can be in his room?" He moves 
forward and peeps through the window. One side of the French 
window is closed. From his angle we see the Baron furtively 
searching the room. He is now wearing an overcoat, the collar 
is turned up. Business ad lib. He finds Preysing's wallet. 
He stuffs this in his overcoat pocket. Preysing's face 
watching him. As Baron turns to exit, Preysing surges forward, 
pulling the window after him. The two men face each other.

PREYSING
Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want 
here?

BARON
I must have made a mistake.

PREYSING
Made a mistake -- remarkable. We 
shall soon see if you made a mistake.
(the Baron starts to 
leave.)
(bellowing)
Stay here... Give me that money.

The Baron hands him the pocketbook without a word.

PREYSING
So that's how we stand, Baron.

BARON
Look here, sir -- I'm completely at 
your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's 
a matter of life or death -- I had 
to get some money -- tonight.

PREYSING
Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. 
Humm -- humm, but you must go to 
jail, Baron, you're a thief.

BARON
Be quiet.

PREYSING
I'm going to call the police. I'm 
going to watch you play the great 
Baron with the police. Aristocrat! 
Aristocrat!
(he picks up the 
telephone)

The Baron makes for the door on the other side of the room, 
pulls at the knob.

PREYSING
The door is locked, Baron.

The Baron makes one dive across the room. Preysing grasps at 
his coat and tears it. With one hand holding the telephone, 
(the receiver dropping on its cord towards the ground) and 
one hand holding the Baron.

PREYSING
(into telephone)
Hello! Hello! --

BARON
Don't do that.
(he tries to snatch 
the telephone from 
Preysing.)

Preysing wrenches the telephone suddenly away from the Baron. 
The action excites him.

PREYSING
Strike me, would you? Attack me would 
you? Attack me --

With a terrific lunge, Preysing brings the telephone down 
upon the Baron's head. The Baron sways, stunned. (as in book). 
In his mad rage, Preysing, hits again with the telephone.

PREYSING
I'll strike you -- I'll strike you -- 
I'll strike you -- Strike me!

By this time the Baron is a heap on the floor. We see Preysing 
come out of his blind trance. He even repeats again.

PREYSING
I strike you --
(with telephone 
foolishly in his 
hand, he looks down 
at what he has done.)

CUT TO:

DOWNSTAIRS TELEPHONE ROOM

Sharp sound of buzzing.

Dozing night girl plugs in, lazily.

NIGHT GIRL
Yes -- yes -- Operator -- Operator --
(she listens -- says 
to herself)
They are having a nice little game 
up there with the telephone.

With nonchalance she flicks plug out again, as she does so:

CUT TO:

PREYSING'S ROOM

New angle. Preysing is on his feet. He has replaced the 
receiver on the telephone, he is putting it back slowly. He 
is terrified.

Door opens behind him.

Flaemmchen, with a dressing gown on, light, filmy thing, 
crosses and looks down at the Baron, without a word. Preysing 
seizes her.

Her hand goes to her head, her eyes roll; for a moment we 
think she is going to faint right on top of the Baron. She 
is trying to collect her senses, it cannot be true. We can 
hear nothing but the heavy breathing of Preysing and the 
traffic below.

Suddenly a motor horn in the street below sounds strident, 
it is the first time we have been conscious of it.

With a swift movement, Flaemmchen dashes towards the door. 
It is locked. She rushes back as if to cut through her own 
room. He reaches for her and rips her dressing gown from 
her, leaving her almost naked. He lunges after her. She tears 
through her own room.

CUT TO:

CORRIDOR

Flaemmchen enters from her room. She looks this way and that. 
After all, it is Flaemmchen and not Lillian Gish, running 
across the ice in "Way Down East," -- it is Flaemmchen, a 
Berlin girl. She pauses to try and clear her brain. "What 
the hell is this -- what is it." The impulse naturally is to 
scream in alarm. She doesn't -- Flaemmchen's don't. She looks 
around. At the end of the passage is Kringelein's room. She 
will go there. We watch her run down the passage uncertainly. 
Without knocking she pushes open Kringelein's door.

CUT TO:

KRINGELEIN'S ROOM

It is in darkness. The only light comes through the windows. 
The form of Kringelein lies prone upon the bed, the Doctor 
had just thrown a coat over him. He is still in his trousers 
and shirt.

Like a ghost, Flaemmchen, the shreds of her filmy clothes 
hanging to her, crosses.

FLAEMMCHEN
(hoarse whisper)
Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Kringelein -- 
where are you?

She sweeps to bed. She shakes him. Kringelein starts up.

FLAEMMCHEN
Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.

KRINGELEIN
Oh -- what -- what --
(he is looking up at 
what seems to be a 
ghost.)

She pulls on the light by the bed, it flames up on their 
faces.

KRINGELEIN
Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --

FLAEMMCHEN
Quick -- something awful -- awful 
has happened. Go -- go at once, -- 
Mr. Preysing --

KRINGELEIN
Preysing?

It occurs to him that this girl with her torn clothes must 
have been roughly treated by Preysing. He suddenly assumes a 
strength.

FLAEMMCHEN
Oh, don't wait -- go -- it's awful -- 
it's awful.

She slides down to the floor, by the side of the bed.

Kringelein climbs out of bed, tries to help her up.

KRINGELEIN
Stay here.

She waves him away.

FLAEMMCHEN
Don't wait now -- go -- Preysing.

Kringelein assumes suddenly a strength. He is a man for a 
crisis -- he forgets that he was ever ill -- he leaves.

WE GO WITH HIM. CUT HIM DOWN CORRIDOR QUICKLY. He pauses 
outside Preysing's door, uncertain of the rooms, then he 
knocks.

KRINGELEIN
(calling)
Mr. Preysing -- Oh, Mr. Preysing --

He feels there must be a mistake -- he steps back, sees 
Flaemmchen's door open next to it. He enters.

CUT HIM THROUGH:

FLAEMMCHEN'S ROOM

He enters. Looks around. Looks through bathroom. Goes quickly 
forward.

CUT INTO REVERSE:

PREYSING'S ROOM

Preysing is still leaning against the table, his mouth is 
open, he is gaping -- stunned. The two hundred and four pounds 
has collapsed and sagged. He is staring, his victim lying -- 
a heap upon the floor, very still and quiet. His eyes come 
around as Kringelein enters.

Kringelein crosses, looks down. Touches the Baron's hand.

KRINGELEIN
Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.

PREYSING
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --

KRINGELEIN
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- 
dead -- just like that.

PREYSING
-- We must do something...

KRINGELEIN
(quickly)
Yes, the police must be called.

PREYSING
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a 
burglar -- he was going to steal my 
money.

KRINGELEIN
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.

PREYSING
(suddenly)
Where is that girl -- she was working 
with him -- she enticed me into her 
room.

KRINGELEIN
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- 
I understand, Mr. General Director 
Preysing.

PREYSING
(frantically)
I can answer for this, it was self-
defense -- I can answer for this -- 
but that girl -- the scandal -- my 
wife -- my daughters, you know them?

KRINGELEIN
Yes, I know them --

PREYSING
The scandal -- we are men -- you -- 
you could take that affair of the 
young lady upon yourself -- take her 
and hold your tongue. Then you can 
travel -- I'll give you anything -- 
anything -- she was with you.

KRINGELEIN
We must call the police, your 
excellency.

Preysing takes him by the shoulders.

PREYSING
How much -- how much do you want -- 
you need money -- you have nothing.

KRINGELEIN
Don't worry about me, Mr. General 
Director Pryesing -- worry about 
yourself.
(he picks up receiver)
There has been a murder -- this is 
room one sixty-four.

CUT TO:

TELEPHONE ROOM

Telephone girl plugs in.

GIRL
Hello -- hurry up... hurry up... 
someone in one sixty-four says there 
has been a murder.

CUT TO:

HALL PORTER

The scene gradually grows intense. Porter calls night man.

PORTER
Here - quick - here -- go to one 
sixty-four immediately.
(calls back on 
telephone)
Give me Mr. Rohna -- Rohna the 
manager.

CUT TO:

ROHNA'S ROOM

Darkened room. Bell ringing. Rohna sits up in bed, turns on 
light, picks up telephone; on his face we see him hear the 
news.

ROHNA
Where?... murder?... who?... all 
right, I'm coming. Wait a minute.
(speaks in a monotone)
Instruct everyone to use the utmost 
tact -- we must have no scandal in 
the Grand Hotel. Answer no questions, 
I'm coming now -- inform the police.

(he replaces the telephone commences dressing quickly)

CUT TO:

GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM

Trunks standing around everywhere. Suzette is finishing 
packing. Grusinskaya is sitting in front of the mirror in a 
loose night wrap -- she is doing her hair.

SUZETTE
Madam should sleep.

GRUSINSKAYA
I've done my hair differently -- do 
you like that?

SUZETTE
When a lady falls in love she does 
her hair differently.

GRUSINSKAYA
(rising)
In the middle of the night -- those 
flowers make me think of a funeral. 
Laurels and tube-roses.
(she pushes the window 
closed, shivers, it 
is chilly. She crosses 
the room turning out 
one of the lights)
Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and 
the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- 
happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.

SUZETTE
(quietly)
Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. 
It is not long 'till the train.

GRUSINSKAYA
Goodnight, Suzette.

Suzette leaves -- turning out a light.

Alone, Grusinskaya goes to the telephone. She raises the 
receiver.

GRUSINSKAYA
Hello -- can you tell me if Baron 
von Gaigern is in his room -- ring 
him.
(talking to herself)
Cherie, I must wake you or you'll 
miss the train.
(into phone)
...yes... are you ringing, he may be 
asleep.
(to herself)
Cherie, you must get up and fetch me 
from my room -- I'm longing for you, 
Cherie -- I have not been to sleep -- 
I kept thinking you would come to 
me.
(into phone)
...Oh, but he must answer. Ring -- 
ring -- ring.

CUT IN HERE at discretion the:

BARON'S EMPTY ROOM

Telephone is ringing.

CUT BACK TO:

GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM

GRUSINSKAYA
(to herself)
Cherie, hurry -- hurry -- hurry. 
Answer the phone -- what is the 
matter.
(into phone)
Ring him -- ring him.
(to herself)
Where are you -- where are you, 
Cherie? Why don't you answer?
(into phone)
Well, ring him -- please -- please.

FADE OUT SLOWLY:

END OF SEQUENCE "#6"

SEQUENCE "#7"

Music up as we --

FADE IN ON:

DISSOLVE INTO - EXTERIOR SERVICE ENTRANCE OF HOTEL

The trees and the milk cart effect and other curious signs 
of dawn, which we remember after the climax of the first 
sequence.

Music cold and eerie.

DISSOLVE OUT:

General early morning bustle and activity.

From one van, fruit and vegetables are being unloaded. From 
another, huge hind quarters of beef are being carried in and 
in a monotonous way a baker throws two loaves at a time, to 
another man, from a van backed up --

BAKER
(counting)
Forty-two -- forty-four -- forty-six -- 
forty-eight -- fifty -- fifty-two --

Waiters coming to work. A noisy racket.

Sandwiched between the bread and butcher vans, is backed a 
hearse.

At the moment we come upon it, the men are pausing in their 
work to glance. The men take off their caps, as; proceeded 
by the hotel detective and others, who will be there, the 
corpse of the Baron in the basket, used at such time, is 
brought out and placed in the hearse, which drives noisily 
away. A policeman rides with the driver on the box.

By this time the man with the bread is counting: 

BAKER
One hundred and eight -- one hundred 
and ten -- one hundred and twelve...

Stay with him for a moment.

DISSOLVE OUT:

DISSOLVE INTO - EXTERIOR FRONT OF HOTEL

Shooting onto door - day lighting.

A man comes out and signals a black closed limousine, which 
pulls forward.

DISSOLVE OUT:

DISSOLVE INTO - MAIN HOTEL LOBBY

Early morning. Sense of chill and desolation. Some chairs 
stand on tables. A vacuum cleaner is at work on the carpets. 
Newspaper boys are delivering papers at the news stand. The 
various shops are slowly being opened, the windows being 
cleaned.

The general feeling of the beginning of another day.

THE CAMERA waits at a distance shooting from door as Preysing, 
with a plain clothes man on either side of him, leaves, moving 
towards THE CAMERA. He is grim, his hat is drawn over his 
eyes. His hands deep in his pockets. When he has passed the 
CAMERA MOVES FORWARD TO:

SENF'S DESK

(the old shot) Meierheim is entering quickly goes through 
the door.

He crosses now to Pimenov. They talk eagerly out of earshot. 
But it is apparent that Meierheim is, as usual, in a hurry.

Rohna is there too. One of the men carries a telephone stand, 
wrapped loosely in paper. But we know it's the telephone 
stand.

Senf comes on duty, looks around, it is apparent that he is 
late.

CLERK
The night clerk has already gone -- 
you are late.

SENF
Man -- I was at the clinic the whole 
night -- there are no words to 
describe what my wife suffered.

CLERK
And the child isn't coming?

SENF
No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't 
let it interfere with my duty. Any 
news here?

CLERK
News? Yes -- killing in number one-
sixty-four.

SENF
What? -- Who? -- Whom?

CLERK
The big manufacturer killed Baron 
von Gaigern.

SENF
Good heavens. What for?

CLERK
I don't know.

SENF
Man -- that's terrible. He was a 
nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.

CLERK
It seems that he was a thief and an 
imposter.

SENF
I don't believe it -- he was a real 
gentleman. I know people... I'm so 
tired I can hardly see out of my 
eyes. No sleep for two nights and so 
many duties and now this killing in 
the hotel -- that means a lot of 
work. But it's too bad about the 
Baron, you always felt better when 
he came along -- always friendly -- 
such an agreeable fellow.

CLERK
Most imposters are --

A number of bellboys march up and form a line. Senf comes 
from behind the desk and inspects them.

SENF
Good morning.

BOYS
(in chorus)
Good morning.

SENF
Show your hands.

They show their hands.

SENF
(to one boy)
You have dirty nails -- you little 
pig -- you're no good... Caps off! -- 
Let's see your hair.
(Boys take off their 
caps)
Good -- caps on!
(Boys put on their 
caps)
Where is number seven?... Not here?
(to clerk)
Take his name -- if he comes late 
again today, he's fired. Dismissed!

The boys sit down on the bench.

THE CAMERA MOVES TO KRINGELEIN.

Kringelein and the police officer move towards the desk in 
ear shot.

KRINGELEIN
Please, officer.

OFFICER
That will be sufficient for the 
present, sir, you may travel in peace.

Kringelein exits.

CUT TO:

CORRIDOR BY ELEVATOR

As Kringelein emerges from the elevator, Suzette speaking to 
the Floor Clerk.

SUZETTE
And they've taken him away.

FLOOR CLERK
Yes -- it's terrible.

SUZETTE
Madam must not know -- you understand -- 
Madam must not know.

FLOOR CLERK
I will tell the maids. I cannot answer 
for downstairs --

Suzette hurries down corridor. By this time Kringelein has 
arrived at his door, he opens it.

CUT TO:

KRINGELEIN'S ROOM

Kringelein opens the door and enters. Flaemmchen is looking 
into space. A lovely picture. Morning light over her hair, 
she is dressed.

KRINGELEIN
What's the matter?

FLAEMMCHEN
Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- 
Lying there, his eyes so open.

KRINGELEIN
You loved the Baron, didn't you?

FLAEMMCHEN
Yes --

KRINGELEIN
So did I. He was friendly to me as 
no man ever was.

FLAEMMCHEN
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- 
But they don't kill a man for that.

KRINGELEIN
He was in desperate straits. He'd 
been trying to raise money all day. 
He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a 
man like Preysing kills him.

FLAEMMCHEN
(naively)
I didn't like Preysing right off.

KRINGELEIN
Then why did you have anything to do 
with him?

FLAEMMCHEN
(simply)
Money!

KRINGELEIN
Yes, of course, -- money!

FLAEMMCHEN
You don't understand that do you?

KRINGELEIN
Of course I do -- I never knew what 
money really meant till I started 
spending it. Do you know --
(he is silent a moment)
I can hardly believe that anything 
so beautiful should come to me from 
Preysing -- I'll take care of you. 
Will -- will you let me?

FLAEMMCHEN
What?

KRINGELEIN
You'll have a good time with me. 
Want to? I've got enough money. Ten 
thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. 
Three thousand four hundred that I 
won. It will last a long time. I can 
win more -- we'll travel.

FLAEMMCHEN
Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there 
always.

KRINGELEIN
Wherever you like. Here I'll give 
you the money I won, three thousand 
four hundred. Later you can have 
more.

FLAEMMCHEN
Later?

KRINGELEIN
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It 
will not be long -- I'll not last 
long. Will you stay with me until...

FLAEMMCHEN
Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, 
he'll cure you. They can cure anything 
these days.

KRINGELEIN
Do you believe that you will have a 
better time with me than you would 
with Preysing?

FLAEMMCHEN
Oh yes, of course.

KRINGELEIN
(takes her hands)
Do you like me better?

FLAEMMCHEN
You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein -- 
a very good man.

Kringelein straightens, happy, inspired, a smile on his face. 
He assumes in his gestures. Takes the telephone.

KRINGELEIN
(into telephone)
When is the next train leaving for 
Paris? -- Yes... Get two tickets for 
me... and my bill please... and the 
lady's -- Miss Flaemm's.
(puts down telephone)
(to Flaemmchen)
We have to hurry let's pack -- we'll 
have breakfast on the train.

CUT TO:

CORRIDOR

The figure of Grusinskaya is standing at her door, there is 
no one with her. Suzette steps out.

SUZETTE
Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is 
waiting downstairs.

GRUSINSKAYA
Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov?
(she looks off.)

FLASH OF PIMENOV

coming out of the elevator.

Grusinskaya hurries down to Pimenov -- they meet.

PIMENOV
(breathlessly)
He will be on the train.

GRUSINSKAYA
But when did he go? How do you know?

She crosses and looks in the Baron's room. A maid is there 
changing the bedding. The room is unoccupied otherwise.

GRUSINSKAYA
Baron von Gaigern has left?

The maid nods.

GRUSINSKAYA
When? How long ago?

Maid shrugs her shoulders.

VOICE OF FLOOR CLERK
The Baron left about half an hour 
ago, Madam.

PIMENOV
Oh -- Gru -- come, come -- we'll 
lose the train.

While they are waiting for the elevator Grusinskaya is like 
a live electric wire.

The elevator arrives. They are stepping in.

CUT TO:

LOBBY

General activity. We hear the cry go up:

VOICE
Madam Grusinskaya's car...

Grusinskaya comes out of the elevator followed by Suzette 
and Pimenov. Meierheim meets her.

MEIERHEIM
Come along, oh, Madam, come along. 
The train will be going.

GRUSINSKAYA
Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.

PIMENOV
What's the use of asking, Gru -- he 
is at the train -- He will be there.

MEIERHEIM
The troupe, the scenery, everything -- 
all on board, waiting. You have a 
rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. 
Come, Madam, are you mad?

Grusinskaya crosses to the desk. She speaks to Senf.

GRUSINSKAYA
Have you seen Baron von Gaigern?

ROHNA
(comes over quickly)
The Baron is not here, Madam.

GRUSINSKAYA
He is gone?

ROHNA
Yes, Madam.

MEIERHEIM
Four minutes past. Please come.

PIMENOV
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- 
he will be there.

MEIERHEIM
(calling)
Madam Grusinskaya's car.

Grusinskaya, followed by the others, sweeps out towards the 
door.

CUT TO:

EXTERIOR HOTEL

Grusinskaya emerges, followed by the others. The sunlight 
hits them.

GRUSINSKAYA
Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in 
Tremezzo --

MEIERHEIM
Every seat for the opening has been 
sold at Vienna. Sold out for three 
days.

GRUSINSKAYA
I know -- I know -- but it will be 
sunny in Tremezzo. We'll have a guest 
then.

SUZETTE
(knowingly)
Yes, Madam.

VOICE
Madam Grusinskaya's car.

Grusinskaya moves forward.

CUT TO:

LOBBY

SENF
(at telephone)
Grand Hotel, Head Porter. What? 
There's been -- a child born? A boy! 
Yes! My child born! It is healthy... 
and my wife? Doing well -- all well!
(to Clerk)
The child has come. They are both 
alive. My child...

CUT TO:

BY ELEVATOR

At this moment Kringelein and Flaemmchen are coming out of 
the elevator, Kringelein is carrying his suitcase.

A bellboy attempts to take his bag but Kringelein, still 
confused draws his hand with the suitcase away from the 
bellboy.

FLAEMMCHEN
Let him take it.

BELLBOY
Your bag, your Excellency --

Hearing the word 'Excellency' Kringelein goes through a 
transformation. He stands and with a flourish hands the 
suitcase over to the boy. He is a big man now.

KRINGELEIN
(very definitely to 
boy)
Cab please!

BELLBOY
Cab, for his Excellency, Mr. 
Kringelein!

KRINGELEIN
(to Flaemmchen)
And now we travel, Flaemmchen... 
Glad?

FLAEMMCHEN
Am I!

KRINGELEIN
(to Senf)
Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?

SENF
At once. Any forwarding address, Mr. 
Kringelein?

KRINGELEIN
Yes, Paris -- Grand Hotel.

FLAEMMCHEN
How do you know there is a Grand 
Hotel?

KRINGELEIN
Oh, there must be one in Paris... 
They have everything in Paris.

SENF
Your bill, Your Excellency.

Kringelein pays and taking Flaemmchen's arm starts to move 
away from the desk, General business ad lib of tipping. Boys 
line up, making a deep bow. There is almost a triumphant 
march as Kringelein and Flaemmchen move towards the door.

SENF CLERK BOYS
(in chorus)
Come again, your Excellency.

With head erect, happy smile on his face, Kringelein leaves 
the lobby. Normal activity in lobby, reminding us of opening 
scene. Doctor comes up to desk.

DOCTOR
Was that Mr. Kringelein leaving?

SHOOTING DRAFT



FADE IN: INT. ANTEROOM CLOSE SHOT SWITCHBOARD

Two telephone operators sit at switchboard busy plugging in 
and out answering calls.

1ST OPERATOR
This is the Morning Post... The City 
Room? Just a moment, I'll connect 
you.
(plugs in call)

2ND OPERATOR
Morning Post... Sports Department? 
Just a moment --
(plugs in call)

CAMERA PULLS BACK to disclose the rest of the anteroom. To 
Camera left are the elevators -- at back wall directly behind 
switchboard are chairs and a table for visitors. Next to 
switchboard are stairs leading downward to the next floor. A 
waist-high iron grill with a gate in it separates the 
switchboard from the anteroom, a similar grill separating it 
again from the city room which stretches on beyond 
switchboard. At a table in the switchboard enclosure sits an 
office boy, about fifteen, doing a crossword puzzle. The big 
clock on the back wall shows that it is nearly one o'clock.

CLOSE SHOT OFFICE BOY

as he bends over paper. We catch a glimpse of the squares of 
a crossword puzzle.

MED. SHOT

as a reporter comes out of the City Room, clanging gate to 
behind him. The office boy looks up.

OFFICE BOY
What's a seven-letter word for --?

REPORTER
Don't ask me! If I knew any seven-
letter words, I'd be something better 
than a reporter!

He catches a glimpse of the far elevator going down.

REPORTER
Hey! Down! Down!

MED. SHOT ELEVATORS

as reporter runs in to the closed elevator door and pounds 
on it. It comes back, the door opens, and he gets in. The 
door closes, as elevator goes down. The near elevator comes 
up and discharges Hildy Johnson and Bruce Baldwin. Bruce 
carries an umbrella and wears a raincoat.

MED. CLOSE SHOT TABLE

office boy looking over his puzzle as Hildy and Bruce come 
into the scene.

HILDY
(with a smile)
Hello, Skinny. Remember me?

OFFICE BOY
(looks up; then a 
glowing smile)
Hildy Johnson!

CLOSE SHOT SWITCHBOARD

Hildy approaches the switchboard.

HILDY
(to operator)
Hello, Maisie.

The first operator looks up.

MAISIE
Hello -- Hildy! You coming back?

HILDY
No, just visiting. Tell me, is the 
lord of the universe in today?

MAISIE
He is -- and in a very bad humor. I 
think somebody stole one of his crown 
jewels. Shall I announce you?

HILDY
No, never mind -- I'll blow my own 
trumpet.

THREE SHOT BRUCE, HILDY AND OPERATOR

Hildy turns to Bruce.

HILDY
I won't be more than ten minutes, I 
promise you.

BRUCE
Even ten minutes is a long time to 
be away from you.

We hear a giggle off scene.

CLOSE SHOT OFFICE BOY

He looks towards Bruce and Hildy and giggles.

TWO SHOT BRUCE AND HILDY

HILDY
What did you say, Bruce?

Bruce, embarrassed, looks at the office boy, then looks back 
at Hildy as they turn toward second gate leading into City 
Room.

BRUCE
I said -- uh -- I said even ten 
minutes -- is a long time -- to be 
away from you.

HILDY
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard 
it, but I just wanted to hear it 
again. I can stand being spoiled a 
little. The gentleman I'm going to 
have a chat with did very little 
spoiling.

BRUCE
(grimly)
I'd like to spoil him just once. 
Sure you don't want me to go in with 
you?

HILDY
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and 
I'll finish it.

BRUCE
I suppose you're right -- but if it 
gets rough, remember I'm here.

HILDY
I'll come a-running, pardner.

She starts to push open the iron-grilled gate leading into 
the City Room. Bruce quickly springs forward and opens it 
for her. Hildy smiles.

HILDY
Thanks, Bruce.

She kisses his cheek and walks through. He looks after her. 
The office boy whistles. Bruce pays no attention, but stares 
after Hildy.

MEDIUM SHOT - SHOOTING DOWN LENGTH OF CITY ROOM

Hildy starts to walk through City Room.

TRUCKING SHOT - HILDY

as she walks the length of the City Room. It's a long walk, 
because it's a room that takes up practically the whole floor. 
The scene is a busy one. But, gradually, as Hildy starts 
down, one after another recognize her. There are cries of: 
"Hildy!" "Hello, Hildy", etc., from the men as Hildy goes 
straight down the aisle. She never stops but waves her own 
greetings: "Jim!" "Hi, good-looking!" "Laura" "Hullo, Pop" 
"Nan!" "Eddie!" "Hello, Mac" "Pete!" "Frank" "Oscar!", and 
gets responses from each of them. One man is bent over his 
desk reading his copy -- he is standing up. Hildy slaps him 
as she goes by. He turns around: "Say, who did that?" As he 
sees Hildy: "Hello, Hildy!" Hildy: "Hi, Jake." She passes a 
middle-aged woman, almost an Edna May Oliver type, seated at 
a desk pounding out copy and smoking a cigarette. As Hildy 
comes up to her she slaps the woman on the back.

HILDY
Hello, Beatrice. How's "Advice to 
the Lovelorn"?

BEATRICE
(looking up)
Hildy! I'll be a monkey's uncle! 
What are you doing here?

HILDY
Point of information -- what does a 
girl say on meeting her divorced 
husband? OR:
(What does a girl do, 
etc.)

BEATRICE
(illustrating)
My advice is duck and cross with 
your right.

Hildy moves on. CAMERA TRUCKS WITH HER to the end of the 
room where she pauses before the frosted glass partition 
which separates Walter Burns' office from the rest of the 
City Room.

INT. BURNS' OFFICE LONG SHOT

as she opens the door. Burns is shaving with an electric 
razor and Louie is holding the mirror up in front of him.

CLOSE SHOT BURNS

shaving, Louie holding the mirror.

LOUIE
A little more round the chin, Boss.

MEDIUM SHOT

There is a sound of the door closing and Burns, without 
looking up, says:

BURNS
What do you want?

HILDY
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's 
no way to talk to your wife -- even 
if she's no longer your wife.

BURNS
(grinning)
Hello, Hildy!

HILDY
Hello, Walter.
(to Louie)
Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine 
king?

LOUIE
Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm 
retired. I'm one of you fellas now -- 
a newspaper man.

HILDY
Editorials?

BURNS
Get going, Louie. I got company.

The door flies open and Duffy comes busting in.

DUFFY
Walter!

BURNS
I'm busy, Duffy.

DUFFY
Well, you're not too busy to know 
that the Governor hasn't signed that 
reprieve!

BURNS
What?

DUFFY
And that means Earl Williams dies 
tomorrow morning and makes a sucker 
out of us!

BURNS
You're crazy. Where's Mac?

DUFFY
He's on my phone. He just called me.

BURNS
They can't do that to me!

He grabs the phone on his desk:

BURNS
Give me that call on Duffy's wire! 
Hello -- Mac? Burns. Where's the 
Governor? -- What do you mean, you 
can't locate him?
(apparently pleading 
to the one man in 
the world who can 
help him)
Mac, you know what this means. We're 
the only paper in town defending 
Earl Williams and if he hangs tomorrow 
we're washed up! Find the Governor 
and when you find him tell him we 
want that reprieve!... Tell him I 
elected him and I can have him 
impeached! Sure, you can do it, Mac -- 
I know you can. I always said you 
were the greatest reporter in the 
country and now you can prove it. 
Get going! Attaboy!

He hangs up.

BURNS
(to Duffy, 
sarcastically)
The greatest reporter in the country! 
First I gotta tell him what news to 
get! Gotta tell him how to get it -- 
then I gotta write it for him 
afterward! Now if you were a decent 
City Editor --

CLOSE SHOT DUFFY AND BURNS

with Louie and Hildy in the b.g.

DUFFY
Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in 
name only. You do all the hiring 
around here.

BURNS
Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. 
Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a 
civil tongue in your head.

MEDIUM SHOT

HILDY
I don't like to interfere with 
business, but would you boys pardon 
us while we have a little heart-to-
heart talk?

DUFFY AND LOUIE
(together)
Well -- But I gotta --

They look at Burns.

BURNS
Scram, you guys.

They start to go.

HILDY
You won't miss anything. You'll 
probably be able to hear him just as 
well outside as here.

They go.

HILDY
Mind if I sit down?

Hildy sits.

CLOSE SHOT DUFFY AND LOUIE

going out of the door. They cast an interested look back and 
linger a second. Over scene comes Burns' voice.

BURNS' VOICE
I said scram!

They close the door hurriedly.

MED. CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND HILDY

HILDY
May I have a cigarette, please?

Burns reaches into his pocket, extracts a cigarette and tosses 
it on the desk. Hildy reaches for it.

HILDY
Thanks. A match?

Burns delves into pockets again, comes up with matchbox, 
tosses it to Hildy, who catches it deftly, and strikes the 
match.

BURNS
How long is it?

Hildy finishes lighting her cigarette, takes a puff, and 
fans out the match.

HILDY
How long is what?

BURNS
You know what. How long since we've 
seen each other?

HILDY
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- 
then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, 
I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.

CLOSEUP BURNS

BURNS
(slyly)
Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing 
me in your dreams?

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT THE TWO

HILDY
(casually)
No -- Mama doesn't dream about you 
any more, Walter. You wouldn't know 
the old girl now.

BURNS
(with conviction)
Oh, yes I would. I'd know you any 
time --

He grows lyrical and, rising from his seat, is about to start 
toward her, as he continues:

BURNS AND HILDY
(together)
-- any place, anywhere --

He sits.

HILDY
(half-pityingly)
You're repeating yourself! That's 
the speech you made the night you 
proposed.
(she burlesques his 
fervor)
"-- any time -- any place -- 
anywhere!"

CLOSE SHOT HILDY AND BURNS

BURNS
(growling)
I notice you still remember it.

HILDY
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't 
remembered it, I wouldn't have 
divorced you.

BURNS
You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you 
hadn't done it.

HILDY
Done what?

BURNS
Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow 
lose faith in himself. It almost 
gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.

HILDY
Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's 
what divorces are for.

BURNS
Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned 
idea that divorces are something 
that last forever -- till 'death us 
do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't 
mean anything today. It's only a few 
words mumbled over you by a judge. 
We've got something between us nothing 
can change.

HILDY
I suppose that's true in a way. I am 
fond of you, Walter. I often wish 
you weren't such a stinker.

BURNS
Now, that's a nice thing to say.

HILDY
Well, why did you promise me you 
wouldn't fight the divorce and then 
try and gum up the whole works?

BURNS
Well, I meant to let you go -- but, 
you know, you never miss the water 
till the well runs dry.

ANOTHER ANGLE

HILDY
A fellow your age, hiring an airplane 
to write:
(she gestures above 
to indicate sky-
writing)
'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember 
my dimple. Walter.! It held things 
up twenty minutes while the Judge 
ran out to watch it.

BURNS
Well, I don't want to brag, but I've 
still got the dimple -- and in the 
same place -- I just acted like any 
husband who doesn't want to see his 
home broken up.

HILDY
What home?

WALTER
What home? Don't you remember the 
home I promised you?

HILDY
Oh, yes -- we were to have it right 
after our honeymoon -- honeymoon!

BURNS
Was it my fault? Did I know that 
coal mine was going to have another 
cave-in? I meant to be with you on 
our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I 
did.

HILDY
All I know is that instead of two 
weeks in Atlantic City with my 
bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a 
coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age 
sixty-three -- getting food and air 
out of a tube! You don't deny that. 
Do you?

BURNS
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat 
the whole country on that story.

HILDY
Well, suppose we did? That isn't 
what I got married for. What's the 
good of -- Look, Walter, I came up 
here to tell you that you'll have to 
stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- 
sending twenty telegrams -- all the 
rest of it, because I'm --

BURNS
Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you 
what. You come back to work on the 
paper and if we find we can't get 
along in a friendly way, we'll get 
married again.

HILDY
What?!!

BURNS
I haven't any hard feelings.

HILDY
Walter, you're wonderful in a 
loathesome sort of way. Now, would 
you mind keeping quiet long enough 
for me to tell you what I came up 
here for?

BURNS
(rising, reaching for 
his hat)
Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch 
and you can tell me everything.

HILDY
(also rising)
I have a lunch date. I just want --

BURNS
You can break it, can't you?

HILDY
No, I can't.

BURNS
Sure you can. Come on.

DIFFERENT ANGLE

HILDY
Don't tell me what to do! We're 
divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're 
not my husband and you're not my 
boss! And what's more, you're not 
going to be my boss.

BURNS
What do you mean by that?

HILDY
Just what I said. That's what I --

BURNS
You mean you're not coming back to 
work here?

HILDY
That's the first time you've been 
right today. That's what I --

BURNS
(still interrupting)
You've had a better offer, eh?

HILDY
You bet I've got a better offer.

BURNS
Well, go on and take it. Work for 
somebody else! That's the gratitude 
I get for --

HILDY
I know, Walter, but I --

BURNS
(ignoring her)
What were you when you came here 
five years ago? A little college 
girl from a School of Journalism! I 
took a little doll-faced mugg --

HILDY
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't 
been doll-faced!

BURNS
Why should I? I thought it would be 
a novelty to have a face around here 
a man could look at without 
shuddering.

HILDY
Listen, Walter --

BURNS
(going right on)
I made a great reporter out of you, 
Hildy, but you won't be half as good 
on any other paper, and you know it. 
You need me and I need you -- and 
the paper needs both of us.

HILDY
Well, the paper'll have to learn to 
do without me. And so will you. It 
just didn't work out, Walter.

WIDER ANGLE

BURNS
It would have worked if you'd been 
satisfied with just being editor and 
reporter. But no! You had to marry 
me and spoil everything.

HILDY
(indignantly)
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I 
proposed to you!

BURNS
Well, you practically did! Making 
goo-goo eyes at me for two years 
till I broke down. And I still claim 
I was tight the night I proposed. If 
you'd been a gentleman you'd have 
forgotten all about it. But not you!

HILDY
(speechless)
You -- you --

She grabs something and chucks it at him. He ducks. The phone 
rings.

BURNS
(to Hildy)
You're losing your eye. You used to 
be able to pitch better than that.
(he reaches for phone)
Hello... Yeah... What? Sweeney? Well, 
what can I do for you?

CLOSE SHOT DUFFY

seated at his desk, talking into phone.

DUFFY
What's the matter with you? Are you 
drunk? This is Duffy, not Sweeney!

CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND HILDY

Burns into phone:

BURNS
Sweeney! You can't do that to me! 
Not today, of all days! Jumping 
Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, 
I suppose so... All right. If you 
have to, you have to.
(he hangs up)
How do you like that? Everything 
happens to me -- with 365 days in 
the year -- this has to be the day.

HILDY
What's the matter?

BURNS
Sweeney.

HILDY
Dead?

BURNS
Not yet. Might just as well be. The 
only man on the paper who can write -- 
and his wife picks this morning to 
have a baby!

CLOSE SHOT HILDY

HILDY
Sweeney?
(she laughs)
Well, after all, he didn't do it on 
purpose, did he?

CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND HILDY

BURNS
I don't care whether he did or not. 
He's supposed to be covering the 
Earl Williams case and there he is -- 
waiting at the hospital! Is there no 
sense of honor left in this country?

HILDY
(practically)
Well, haven't you got anybody else?

BURNS
There's nobody else on the paper who 
can write! This'll break me, unless --
(he stares at Hildy; 
then a light breaks)
Hildy!

HILDY
No!

BURNS
You've got to help me, Hildy.

HILDY
Keep away --

BURNS
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- 
just the way we used to be.

HILDY
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- 
any place -- anywhere!"

BURNS
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger 
than anything that's happened to us. 
Don't do it for me! Do it for the 
paper.

HILDY
Get away, Svengali.

BURNS
If you won't do it for love, how 
about money? Forget the other offer 
and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks 
a week.

HILDY
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --

BURNS
All right -- thirty-five, and not a 
cent more!

HILDY
Please! Will you just --

BURNS
Great grief! What's that other paper 
going to give you?

HILDY
I'm not working for any other paper!

BURNS
Oh! In that case, the raise is off 
and you go back to your old salary 
and like it. Trying to blackjack --

HILDY
Look at this!
(pulling her glove 
off her left hand)

CLOSEUP HILDY

She gets glove off left hand and holds up an engagement ring 
for him to see.

HILDY
Do you see this? Do you know what an 
engagement ring is?

CLOSEUP BURNS

He looks at ring, swallows, then:

MED. SHOT

Burns and Hildy.

HILDY
I tried to tell you right away but 
you started reminiscing. I'm getting 
married, Walter, and also getting as 
far away from the newspaper business 
as I can get! I'm through.

BURNS
(himself again)
Get married all you want to, Hildy, 
but you can't quit the newspaper 
business.

HILDY
You can't sell me that, Walter.

BURNS
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper 
man.

HILDY
That's why I'm quitting. I want to 
go some place where I can be a woman.

BURNS
I know you, Hildy, and I know what 
it would mean. It would kill you.

CLOSER SHOT

HILDY
(bitterly)
A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- 
running after fire engines -- waking 
people up in the middle of the night 
to ask them if they think Hitler's 
going to start a war -- stealing 
pictures off old ladies of their 
daughters that got chased by apemen! 
I know all about reporters -- a lot 
of daffy buttinskies going around 
without a nickel in their pockets, 
and for what? So a million hired 
girls and motormen's wives will know 
what's going on! No, Walter, I'm 
through.

BURNS
Where'd you meet this man?

HILDY
Bermuda.

BURNS
Bermuda... Rich, eh?

HILDY
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about 
five thousand a year.

BURNS
What's his line?

HILDY
He's in the insurance business.

BURNS
(looks up)
The insurance business?

HILDY
(on the defensive)
It's a good, honest business, isn't 
it?

ANOTHER ANGLE

BURNS
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I 
can't picture you with a guy who 
sells policies.

HILDY
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets 
the office when he's with me. He 
doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- 
he treats me like a woman.

BURNS
He does, does he? How did I treat 
you -- like a water buffalo?

HILDY
I don't know about water buffaloes, 
but I know about him. He's kind and 
sweet and considerate. He wants a 
home -- and children.

BURNS
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought 
to marry. What's his name?

HILDY
Well, I'll give you a hint. By 
tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. 
Bruce Baldwin.

BURNS
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as 
that?

HILDY
The quicker the better. Well -- I 
finally got out what I came in to 
tell you.
(she extends her hand)
So long, Walter, and better luck 
next time.

BURNS
(taking her hand)
I wish you everything I couldn't 
give you, Hildy.

HILDY
Thanks...

BURNS
Too bad I couldn't see this guy first. 
I'm pretty particular about whom my 
wife marries.

HILDY
(laughing)
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom 
for me now.

BURNS
Say, could I meet him?

HILDY
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do 
any good.

BURNS
You're not afraid, are you?

HILDY
Afraid? I should say not!

BURNS
All right then, come on and let's 
see this paragon.
(gets hat)
Is he as good as you say?

HILDY
Better.

MED. SHOT OFFICE

Burns has his hat. They start toward the door.

BURNS
Then what does he want with you?

HILDY
(laughing)
Now you got me.

BURNS
Nothing personal. I was just asking.

At the door, Burns walks ahead, opens door and walks out.

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BURNS' OFFICE MED. CLOSE SHOT BURNS

BURNS
After all --

He stops as he realizes she's not there. The door opens. 
Hildy comes out.

HILDY
You wouldn't believe this, Walter, 
but Bruce holds the door open for 
me.

BURNS
(incredulous)
No kidding?

INT. CITY ROOM FULL SHOT

Reporters conversing. They stop as Hildy and Burns enter 
scene.

TRUCKING SHOT

as Hildy follows Burns through the City Room. This time, in 
contrast to Hildy's original walk through the room, the groups 
are silent as they watch the two.

HILDY
(trying to keep pace)
And he takes his hat off when he's 
with a lady.

BURNS
(over his shoulder)
What for?

HILDY
(shouting)
And when he walks with a lady, he 
waits for her!

BURNS
(stops)
Oh, I'm sorry.

Burns, at this point, has reached the switchboard. He says, 
under his breath, to Maisie:

BURNS
(under his breath)
Have Duffy call me in the restaurant 
in twenty minutes.

Hildy, a little out of breath, catches up with him. At the 
iron gate that opens into anteroom Hildy jumps ahead, opens 
the gate and holds it for Burns.

HILDY
Allow me.

BURNS
(walking right through)
Thanks.

Hildy follows him out.

INT. ANTEROOM MED. SHOT

as Hildy follows Burns in. Bruce is sitting on the bench. On 
the end of a bench sits an old, grizzled Western Union "boy". 
Ignoring Bruce, Burns strides over to the "boy", seizes his 
hand, shakes it and says:

BURNS
I can see right away my wife picked 
out the right husband for herself.

CLOSE SHOT BRUCE

Hildy behind him. Bruce registers amazement at this.

CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND MESSENGER

The messenger is more amazed than Bruce as Burns keeps pumping 
his hand vigorously.

MESSENGER
There must be some mistake. I'm 
already married.

BURNS
(you never saw a more 
surprised man)
Already married!
(turning to Hildy 
o.s.)
Hildy, why didn't you tell me?

CLOSEUP HILDY

She shakes her head at Burns' antics, but can't help smiling 
nevertheless.

MEDIUM SHOT BURNS AND MESSENGER

BURNS
(again seizing 
messenger's hand)
Congratulations again, Mr. Baldwin!

MESSENGER
But my name --

BRUCE
(as he enters scene)
Mr. Burns!

Burns turns slightly but doesn't release messenger's hand.

BURNS
Yeah? You'll have to excuse me -- 
I'm busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin here. 
Just leave your card with the boy.

CLOSE SHOT BRUCE AND BURNS

Bruce takes hold of Burns' coat and shakes it to get his 
attention. Burns turns on him:

BURNS
I'm very sorry, but I'm busy! Look --
(he points o.s.)
-- there's the boy. Take your card 
and leave it with him.

He turns away again. Bruce, determinedly, takes hold of his 
sleeve and pulls at it.

BRUCE
Mr. Burns --

BURNS
(wheeling around)
I've just told you I was busy with 
Mr. Bruce Baldwin!

BRUCE
I'm Bruce Baldwin!

MEDIUM SHOT

Burns, still pumping the dazed messenger's hand, stops at 
this, drops hand, and turns to Bruce:

BURNS
You're Bruce Baldwin?

BRUCE
Yes!

BURNS
(accusing to messenger)
Then who are you?

MESSENGER
(falteringly)
My name's Pete Davis.

BURNS
Pete Davis! Well, Mr. Davis, this is 
no concern of yours and after this 
I'll thank you to keep out of my 
affairs!

The messenger isn't quite sure what he's done but he slinks 
back to his seat as Burns turns to Bruce.

CLOSEUP HILDY

She is beginning to get sore, but reluctantly again she is 
compelled to smile at Walter's behavior.

CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND BRUCE

BURNS
(reaches for Bruce's 
hand but grabs the 
umbrella and begins 
shaking the handle 
up and down)
This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and 
I'm sorry about the mistake.

BRUCE
(he tries to shift 
the umbrella, calling 
Burns' attention to 
it, and offers his 
hand instead)

BURNS
Oh, I thought there was something 
funny... You see, Bruce, you don't 
mind if I call you Bruce, do you? 
After all, we're practically related --

BRUCE
(completely unnerved 
by this time, and 
you can't quite blame 
him)
Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at 
all.

BURNS
You see, my wife -- I mean, your 
wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had 
led me to expect that she was marrying 
a much older man.

BRUCE
(this is the final 
crusher)
Oh.

BURNS
But I see, she didn't mean old in 
years. You always carry an umbrella, 
Bruce?

BRUCE
Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy 
this morning.

BURNS
That's right. -- Rubbers, too, I 
hope? A man ought to be prepared for 
any emergency.

Burns looks down. Bruce, in unconscious responses, helplessly 
lifts his foot up and we see the rubber.

BURNS
Attaboy!
(taking Bruce's arm 
and leading him toward 
elevator)
Come on, Bruce.

BRUCE
(going along, but 
worried)
Where are we going?

BURNS
Where are we going? I'm going to buy 
you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell 
you?

BRUCE
(a helpless look back 
at Hildy)
No -- she didn't.

BURNS
Just wanted to surprise you, I guess.
(as the elevator is 
about to pass, he 
calls)
Down!
(practically shoving 
Bruce in)
After you, Bruce!
(as Bruce disappears 
inside he turns toward 
Hildy)
Come on, Hildy, my treat!

CLOSE SHOT BURNS NEAR OPEN ELEVATOR

We don't see the passengers. Hildy comes into scene.

HILDY
I suppose I can't call this off 
without creating a scene -- but 
remember, it's your last fling.

BURNS
(hurt)
How do you like that? Here I am being 
nice to you and your sweet-heart and 
that's the thanks I get!

He jumps into the elevator -- in a second he hops out.

BURNS
(very sweetly -- he 
almost sings it)
Oh -- after you, Hildy!

With a look of disgust Hildy gets in. Burns follows and the 
door slams on them.

CLOSEUP OFFICE BOY

He looks after departed elevator and whistles. Then he grins 
all over.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. RESTAURANT CLOSEUP - A BEAMING WAITER

HE GRINS ALL OVER AND SAYS:

WAITER
Don't tell me it's you, Hildy!

CAMERA PULLS BACK and discloses our three at a restaurant 
table. Nothing swanky -- a place like Jack Blake's in New 
York, say.

HILDY
(beaming at waiter)
Nobody else.

She extends her hand. The waiter takes it; they shake.

HILDY
How's everything, Gus?

GUS
I can't complain.

BURNS
(studying menu)
Well, I can. I'm hungry. Roast beef 
sandwich -- rare. And some coffee.

GUS
Shall I put a little rum in the 
coffee? It's a nasty day.

BURNS
Good idea. How about you, Hildy?

HILDY
(discarding menu)
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. 
And coffee.

GUS
Little rum in yours, too?

HILDY
I guess so.

Bruce looks at her. She hurriedly changes her mind.

HILDY
No -- just coffee, Gus.

GUS
(crestfallen)
Just coffee.
(to Bruce)
And you, sir?

BRUCE
(putting menu down)
Oh, I'll take the same, I guess. And 
a glass of milk.

GUS
(incredulous)
Milk?

BRUCE
(thinks he hasn't 
heard)
Yes.

GUS
(shaking his head as 
he writes it down)
Milk.

BURNS
And don't put any rum in it, Gus.

CLOSEUP - GUS

Gus gives him a look and goes.

ANOTHER ANGLE - THE TRIO AT TABLE

Burns surveys the others quizzically.

BURNS
(a sigh)
Well, so you're getting married 
tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?

BRUCE
Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're 
taking the four o'clock train to 
Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.

BURNS
(it's the Puritan in 
him)
Taking the train today -- and being 
married tomorrow?

He whistles.

BRUCE
(rising to the bait)
Oh, it isn't like that.

HILDY
(reassuring Mrs. Grundy)
It will be perfectly all right, 
Walter. Mother is coming with us on 
the train.

BURNS
Mother? But your mother --

BRUCE
No. My mother.

BURNS
(he gets it and 
underlines it)
Oh. Your mother -- well, of course, 
that relieves my mind.

HILDY
(to Bruce)
Isn't it sweet of Walter -- still 
wanting to protect me?

She gives Burns that too-sweet look.

BURNS
(apparently taking 
this at face value)
I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, 
but you can always count on me.

TWO SHOT - FEATURING BRUCE AND HILDY

BRUCE
(a little cookily)
I don't think she'll need you very 
much -- I aim to do most of the 
protecting myself.

He pats Hildy's arm -- she smiles at him.

THREE SHOT - HILDY, BRUCE AND BURNS

BURNS
Well, I'll tell you one thing, old 
man, she never looked at me the way 
she's looking at you.

HILDY
I might have, Walter, but you were 
never there.

BURNS
Anyway, I'm glad you two are going 
to be happy and have all the things 
I couldn't give her. You know, Hildy 
is about the best reporter in the 
country -- and that goes regardless 
of sex. But all she really ever wanted 
was a home.

BRUCE
Well, I'll try to give her one.

BURNS
I know you will, Bruce. Are you going 
to live with your mother?

BRUCE
Just for the first year.

BURNS
(sighing)
That'll be nice. A home with mother. 
A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. 
Ow!

That "ow" is sotto voce, but it's the direct result of a 
kick under the table from Hildy.

BRUCE
Mighty nice little town, Albany. 
They've got the State Capitol there, 
you know.

BURNS
Yes, I know...
(he chuckles)
Hildy, will you ever forget the night 
you brought the Governor back to 
your hotel room and found me taking 
a bath? She didn't even know I was 
in town...

His laugh stops cold and he clutches for his shin again. 
Hildy just looks. Providentially, the waiter enters the scene.

GUS
Well, here we are.

He begins serving them.

BURNS
(trying to pick up 
again after a second)
How's business, Bruce?

BRUCE
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance 
town. Most people there take it out 
pretty early in life.

BURNS
I don't blame them.

Gus, who has just managed to come between Hildy and Burns, 
lets out a startled "ouch".

HILDY
Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must 
have slipped.

GUS
(a pained expression 
belies his words)
That's all right.

BURNS
I sometimes wish I'd taken out 
insurance -- but, of course, now it 
doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it 
would have been the smart thing to 
do.

BRUCE
Well, I honestly feel that way. I 
figure I'm in one line of business 
that really helps people. Of course, 
we don't help you much when you're 
alive -- but afterward -- that's 
what counts.

BURNS
I see what you mean.

They fall to.

CLOSE SHOT - HILDY

She sips her coffee and acts surprised.

HILDY
Gus, this --

CLOSEUP - GUS

GUS
(winking)
Good coffee, isn't it?

CLOSEUP - HILDY

She smiles and winks back, and takes another sip.

GROUP SHOT AT TABLE

Gus starts to go.

BRUCE
You've forgotten my milk.

GUS
Oh. The milk. Yes.

He leaves scene, shaking his head. Burns sips his coffee. He 
likes it. He lifts his cup to Hildy.

BURNS
Here's luck to the bride and 
bridegroom.

HILDY
(lifts cup)
Thank you.

BRUCE
(looking for something 
to respond with -- 
apologetically)
He hasn't brought my milk yet.

A bus boy comes into scene and stops before Burns.

BUS BOY
They want you on the phone, Mr. Burns.

BURNS
They would!

Boy goes, Burns rises, starts off, comes back for his cup of 
coffee, which he then takes off with him.

TWO SHOT - BRUCE AND HILDY

BRUCE
(looking after him)
You know, Hildy, he's not a bad 
fellow.

HILDY
(looking at him 
maternally)
You're so nice, Bruce, you think 
everybody else is.

BRUCE
Oh, he's not the man for you. I can 
see that. But I sort of like him. 
Got a lot of charm.

HILDY
He comes by it naturally. His 
grandfather was a snake.

BRUCE
(shaking his head)
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting 
at lunch with him -- but he swept me 
right off my feet.

HILDY
That's what he did to me. Swept me 
right off my feet -- and left me 
lying on the floor.

INT. PHONE BOOTH FULL SHOT

Burns is listening, has coffee on ledge and sips it now and 
then.

BURNS
Get this -- get Sweeney off that 
yarn and out of town on a two weeks' 
vacation -- and right away... All 
right, Duffy, keep your shirt on. 
Hildy's coming back... No. She doesn't 
know it yet. But she'll be there. I 
promise you, Duffy. And tell Louie 
to stick around.

He hangs up, smiles, and finishes the coffee. Then he girds 
himself for being crushed. He gradually begins to look sunk. 
He pulls out a small mirror to study his expression till he 
finally gets what he wants. He holds that expression as he 
comes out of the booth.

INT. RESTAURANT MED. SHOT AT TABLE

Gus is entering the scene.

GUS
Your milk, sir.

He serves Bruce.

GUS
And I brought you another cup of 
coffee, Hildy.

Gus serves her and puts still another cup in front of Burns' 
chair.

HILDY
Thanks, Gus.

She takes a sip and almost chokes.

BRUCE
Too hot?

HILDY
(gasping for breath)
No. It's strong.
(quickly)
But I like it that way.

Gus goes, smiling.

BRUCE
(looking off)
Say, what's happened to Burns? He 
looks sunk, doesn't he?

HILDY
(beaming)
He certainly -- hic -- does!

Burns comes into scene, looking like a 1929 banker just before 
jumping off a roof, and sits down.

BRUCE
Anything the matter?

BURNS
Just Sweeney again. One of my best 
reporters.

HILDY
What now?

BURNS
His wife had twins and he went out 
to celebrate and got as drunk as a 
lord. They can't even find him.
(he sips his coffee)
I tell you, drink is the ruin of 
this nation.

HILDY
(sipping hers)
You said it.

BURNS
So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl 
Williams gets hanged tomorrow.

BRUCE
Just what is the lowdown on Williams?

BURNS
It's simple. A poor little dope who 
lost his job went berserk and shot a 
cop who was coming after him to quiet 
him down.

HILDY
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State 
just put him away?

BURNS
Because it happened to be a colored 
policeman.

HILDY
(for Bruce's benefit)
The colored vote happens to be very 
important to the Mayor of this town.

BURNS
Especially with an election coming 
up in a few days.

BRUCE
Are you sure Williams is not all 
there?

BURNS
All you've got to do is talk to him. 
But the Mayor would hang his own 
grandmother to be re-elected.

BRUCE
But couldn't you show the man wasn't 
responsible?

CLOSEUP - BURNS

BURNS
(there's a sly 
expression on his 
face)
How?

HILDY'S VOICE
You could run an interview that would 
prove it. Remember the interview I 
wrote with Jimmy Wellman? That saved 
his life.

BURNS
(slapping hands 
together)
Yes, you could do it, Hildy. You 
could save that poor devil's life. 
You could -- but --
(the enthusiasm dies 
away)
-- you're going away. I forgot.

THREE SHOT

BRUCE
How long would the interview take?

BURNS
Oh -- an hour for the interview. 
Another hour to write it.

BRUCE
We could take the six o'clock train, 
Hildy. If it would save a man's life.

HILDY
No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This 
is a trick to get your sympathy. No, 
Walter, I've been waiting for 
something like this -- but I wasn't 
sure when you'd spring it. If you 
want to save Earl Williams' life, 
you can interview him yourself. You're 
still a good reporter. Bruce and I 
will be on that four o'clock train -- 
and thanks just the same.

BURNS
I'm an editor. I know what ought to 
be written, but I can't write it the 
way you could. It needs a woman's 
heart --

HILDY
Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!

BURNS
(to Bruce)
You see what I had to put up with? 
She never trusted me! You argue with 
her -- otherwise you're going on a 
honeymoon with blood on your hands!

Bruce gulps.

BURNS
How can you have any happiness after 
that? All through the years you'll 
remember that a man went to the 
gallows because you were too selfish 
to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl 
Williams' face will come between you 
on the train tonight -- and at the 
preacher's tomorrow -- and all the 
rest of your lives!

HILDY
(breaking into applause)
What a performance! Bravo! Don't let 
him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an 
act!

BURNS
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't 
you got any feeling?

HILDY
Well, it's either an act on your 
part or a miracle on Sweeney's.

BURNS
What do you mean?

HILDY
I happen to know Sweeney was married 
only three months ago. If he's got 
twins this morning, I claim it was 
done with mirrors.

BURNS
(laughs, throws up 
his hands)
All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But 
I'll make you and Bruce a business 
proposition.

HILDY
We're not interested.

BURNS
(to Bruce)
Maybe you'll be. You're a smart young 
man. You let Hildy do this story for 
me and you can write out a $100,000.00 
insurance policy for me. What do you 
say?

BRUCE
I don't use my wife for business 
purposes, Mr. Burns!

HILDY
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's 
commission on a $100,000.00 policy?

BRUCE
Well, at his age, twenty payment 
life, a little over a thousand 
dollars.

HILDY
And what's the matter with a thousand 
dollars?

BRUCE
But --

HILDY
According to the budget, we laid out 
that's more than our food bill for a 
whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't 
want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm 
perfectly willing to use him. How 
long will it take to get him examined?

BRUCE
I could get a company doctor in twenty 
minutes.

BURNS
Now you're talking!

HILDY
(turning on Burns)
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose 
you examine Mr. Burns in his office. 
I'll get my bag and go over to the 
Press Room in the Criminal Courts 
Building. You phone me as soon as 
Mr. Burns has given you his check. 
Then I'll go get the interview and 
you phone Mother that we're taking 
the six o'clock train.
(back to Burns)
And no tricks, Walter!

BURNS
What tricks would I pull?

HILDY
Oh, nothing! Of course, you might 
cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! 
What would be his first payment on 
that policy?

BRUCE
About twenty-five hundred dollars.

HILDY
Better make that a certified check, 
Walter.

BURNS
(indignantly)
What do you think I am -- a crook?

HILDY
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! 
No certified check -- no story -- 
Get me?

BURNS
All right. The check will be 
certified. Want my fingerprints?

HILDY
(rising)
No thanks, I've still got those. 
Well, I'll step into some working 
clothes and hop over to the Press 
Room for the background on this yarn. 
It'll be kind of fun to see the boys 
again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must 
be certified.

BRUCE
All right, dear.

HILDY
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got 
that money?

BRUCE
(feeling his pocket)
The five hundred? Sure.

HILDY
On second thought, would you let me 
have it? I'll get the tickets.

BRUCE
But --

HILDY
Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm 
doing. He'd get you in a crap game --

BRUCE
But I don't gamble, Hilda!

HILDY
I know a lot of men who didn't do 
anything till they met Walter Burns. 
Please, dear.

BRUCE
(reluctantly)
All right.
(he pulls out his 
wallet)
One -- two -- three -- four -- five. 
Five hundred. Be careful, honey.

HILDY
I'll be careful, darling. You be, 
please.

She kisses him, kisses her hand and pats it to Burns' cheek.

HILDY
So long, husbands.

She goes.

TRUCKING SHOT - HILDY

leaving. She weaves just a bit.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO MEN

They look after her.

BRUCE
(smiling a little)
I never knew Hildy to be so determined 
before.

BURNS
You haven't seen anything yet.

Bruce turns to look at Burns -- they look at each other.

FADE OUT:

FADE IN: INT. PRESS ROOM - CRIMINAL COURTS BLDG - DAY CLOSE 
SHOT AT TELEPHONE

It is ringing. A hand comes in to take the phone. CAMERA 
DRAWS BACK A LITTLE to show Endicott taking the phone. He 
has an eye shade over his eyes and five cards in his other 
hand.

ENDICOTT
(into phone)
Criminal Courts Press Room... This 
is Endicott... No, nothing new on 
the Williams case yet boss. Well, 
you bet I'm here plugging away every 
minute.
(hangs up and studies 
his cards)
Up a dime.

CAMERA PANS SLOWLY to reveal the other players as they speak. 
Playing are reporters Murphy, Endicott, Wilson, Schwartz and 
McCue.

MURPHY
(dropping his cards)
By me.

WILSON
(also dropping)
Droparoo.

Schwartz knocks on table and drops cards.

MCCUE
(reluctantly)
I'll call.

ENDICOTT
Three sixes. Is that any good?

HILDY'S VOICE
It sure looks good from here.

The boys all look up toward sound of Hildy's voice.

CLOSE SHOT HILDY JOHNSON

framed in the doorway. She is carrying a bag and has changed 
her costume to a tailored travelling suit. She grins and 
comes into the room.

MED. SHOT REPORTERS

They are all talking at once as Hildy comes into the scene. 
There are ad libs of "Hildy!" "Where'd you come from?" "Holy 
Mackeral, Hildy Johnson!", etc. Hildy raises her hand for 
silence.

HILDY
One at a time, boys.

She enters to a desk, places her bag on top of the desk, 
takes her hat off and hangs it on a clothes tree in the 
corner, comes back to desk and opens the travelling bag. All 
through the above action she is talking rapidly.

HILDY
No, I'm not back for good. I'm just 
covering the Earl Williams story for 
Mr. Sweeney who had a sudden attack 
of something but will be all right 
by tomorrow. No, I haven't made up 
with Walter Burns -- far from it! As 
a matter of fact, I'm leaving tonight 
for Albany and I'll be married 
tomorrow morning. The lucky man is 
Mr. Bruce Baldwin, a gentleman in 
the insurance business -- and when I 
say gentleman, I mean gentleman! Are 
there any other questions?

Hildy takes notebook and pencil out of bag, looks at the 
stockings she is wearing, sees she has a run and takes a 
fresh pair out of the bag. She sits down and begins to put 
on the new stockings.

ENDICOTT
(grinning)
Well, that about covers everything.

HILDY
Good. Now I want to ask you fellows 
a couple of questions. Did Earl 
Williams know what he was doing when 
he fired that gun?

MURPHY
If you ask us, no. If you ask the 
state alienists, the answer is yes.

MCCUE
It's a simple story. Earl Williams 
works for the E.J. McClosky 
Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper 
for fourteen years. He starts in at 
twenty dollars a week and gradually 
works his way up to twenty-two fifty. 
A year ago the McClosky Company goes 
out of business and Williams loses 
his job.
(waving his hand toward 
Wilson)
Take it away, Fred Wilson!

WILSON
Well -- Williams goes a little balmy 
and begins making speeches on a plan 
he's got to save the world. Only he 
makes his speeches, usually, on a 
very busy street and neglects to get 
a license for it. Well, the cops let 
him alone as much as they can because 
he's harmless and they're kinda sorry 
for him. But one day he decides to 
hold a meeting right in the middle 
of a Veteran's Parade and the cops 
chase him. He gets scared and goes 
into hiding.
(gesturing toward 
Schwartz)
Come in, Dave Schwartz.

SCHWARTZ
His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out 
with a statement that Earl Williams 
is a dangerous character in the employ 
of two or three foreign governments 
and the police are going to get him 
dead or alive. Somebody sends out a 
tip that this guy is hiding in Molly 
Malloy's joint. And this colored 
policeman, Daniels, goes over to 
pick Williams up. Williams has read 
the papers, thinks the cop is going 
to kill him and shoots first. That 
is all.

HILDY
Thanks, boys. That's all I want to 
know.

Hildy gets up, rolls the pair of stockings she has just 
discarded into a ball, crosses to Bensinger's desk and puts 
the stockings in a drawer.

ENDICOTT
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's 
desk.

HILDY
I know, I just want to give him a 
thrill.

Hildy crosses back to desk and sits down.

HILDY
All right, boys, now that everything 
is settled, deal me in.

Hildy glances toward clock on wall. The hands show 2:45 PM.

INSERT: CLOCK - Hands pointing to 2:45 PM.

CLOSE SHOT HILDY

She picks up phone nearest her on desk and starts to dial, 
picking up cards dealt her with one hand.

HILDY
(into phone)
Hello, this is Hildy Johnson. Get me 
Walter Burns.
(she studies her cards -- 
then, into phone)
Hello, Walter. How's the old double-
crosser?

CLOSE SHOT WALTER BURNS

Telephone at his ear.

BURNS
Hello, my fine-feathered friend. 
Thought I might be hearing from you. 
What have you got to report?

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT and we see that Burns is 
stripped to the waist. A doctor is applying a stethoscope to 
his chest. We HOLD the picture a second: Burns listening 
intently on the phone and the doctor listening intently to 
his chest.

BURNS
(into phone)
Going all right, eh?

DOCTOR
(nodding)
Fine.

Doctor suddenly realizes what he's said and looks up.

BURNS
(putting hand over 
mouthpiece of phone)
Doctor, will you please keep quiet a 
minute? How do you expect me to get 
any work done?

CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Bruce, who has some papers in 
front of him at the desk. Bruce grins.

DOCTOR
How do you expect me to get anywhere 
if you're going to keep on that phone? 
If you'll just give me two minutes 
more --

BURNS
(into phone)
Well, they haven't finished with me 
yet but I'm hoping to get my shirt 
back. Oh, no. I'm in the pink of 
condition. They found two new dimples.

CUT TO:

INT. PRESS ROOM - CRIMINAL COURTS BLDG. CLOSE SHOT HILDY AT 
TELEPHONE

cards in her other hand.

HILDY
How about that check? All right, Mr. 
Burns, but remember, no checkee -- 
no story. Well, as soon as they decide 
whether you live or not will you 
have that new man of mine call me 
up? Yes, sir.
(she hangs up)
All right, boys. Up a dime.

ENDICOTT'S VOICE
Right back at you.

MED. SHOT

MCCUE
(dropping his cards)
You fight it cut.

HILDY
And up a dime.

ENDICOTT
(studying a second)
I call. What you got?

HILDY
(displaying her cards)
Three bullets! Any good?

ENDICOTT
(throwing his cards 
away)
Beats king up.

Hildy rakes in the money.

MCCUE
What are you going to do with all 
that money, Hildy?

WILSON
Yeah -- you can't spend it in Albany.

HILDY
Oh, I'll think of something.

MED. SHOT

taking in door and including group. Bensinger, another 
reporter, comes in from the corridor. He stands out from the 
others because of his tidy appearance, and carries a book 
under his arm.

MURPHY
Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on 
the hanging?

CLOSE SHOT BENSINGER

BENSINGER
(cockily)
Why don't you fellows get your own 
news?

CLOSE SHOT HILDY

HILDY
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?

TWO SHOT FEATURING HILDY AND BENSINGER

BENSINGER
Hildy!

He comes over to shake hands.

BENSINGER
Are you back?

HILDY
No, just a farewell appearance, 
batting for Sweeney. I'm going into 
business for myself.

BENSINGER
What doing?

HILDY
I'm getting married tomorrow.

BENSINGER
Well, congratulations! Good luck!

THE TABLE ANOTHER ANGLE

ENDICOTT
Why don't you use him for a 
bridesmaid, Hildy?

SCHWARTZ
Come on, Hildy, your deal.

CLOSE SHOT BENSINGER AT HIS DESK

He opens a drawer, the one in which Hildy put her stockings.

BENSINGER
Say, who put these stockings in my 
desk?
(he turns to the group)

McCUE's VOICE I don't know, but I think they got rats in the 
building.

BENSINGER
(makes a gesture of 
disgust and picks up 
telephone)
This is Bensinger. I just saw the 
Sheriff. He won't move the hanging 
up a minute... All right, I'll talk 
to him again, but it's no use. The 
execution is set for seven in the 
morning. Get me a rewrite man.

CLOSE SHOT ENDICOTT

dealing the cards.

ENDICOTT
Why can't they hang that guy at a 
reasonable hour, so we can get some 
sleep?

CLOSE SHOT BENSINGER

BENSINGER
(into phone)
Jake, new lead on the hanging. This 
new alienist from New York -- Dr. 
Max J. Egelhoffer -- is going to 
interview Williams in about half an 
hour -- in the Sheriff's office.

MED. SHOT AT TABLE - FEATURING MURPHY

Murphy reaches for the phone. Without dropping his cards, he 
jiggles the hook.

MURPHY
That must be the tenth alienist 
they've had on Williams. Even if he 
wasn't crazy before, he would be 
after ten of those babies got through 
psychoanalyzing him.
(into phone)
Gimme the desk.

ENDICOTT
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.

MURPHY
Yeah? What did he ever do for his 
country?

ENDICOTT
Don't you remember? He's the guy 
went to Washington to interview the 
Brain Trust, and gave out a statement 
that they were all sane. It created 
a sensation!

CLOSE SHOT BENSINGER

He is referring to his notes as he talks:

BENSINGER
(into phone)
Here's the situation on the eve of 
the hanging:

CLOSE SHOT MURPHY

He continues playing his cards:

MURPHY
(into phone)
This is Murphy. More slop on the 
hanging.

CLOSE SHOT BENSINGER

BENSINGER
(into phone)
A double guard's been thrown around 
the jail, municipal buildings, 
railroad terminals, and elevated 
stations to prepare for the expected 
general uprising of radicals at the 
hour of execution.

CLOSE SHOT MURPHY

MURPHY
(into phone)
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two 
hundred more relatives on the payroll 
to protect the city against the Red 
Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a 
couple of minutes.
(consults his hand)
Up a dime.

CLOSE SHOT BENSINGER

BENSINGER
(into phone)
The Sheriff has just received four 
more letters threatening his life, 
but he says nothing can interfere 
with his duty.

CLOSE SHOT MURPHY

MURPHY
(into phone)
And to prove to the voters that the 
Red Menace is on the level, the 
Sheriff has written himself four 
more letters, threatening his life. 
I know he wrote 'em on account of 
the misspellings.

MED. SHOT AT TABLE FEATURING HILDY

ENDICOTT
Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows 
up the Sheriff will still be crying 
'Wolf!'

MURPHY
What have you got, Hildy?

HILDY
Kings and sixes.

MURPHY
(throwing down)
That's good.

HILDY
(sweeping coins in)
'Kings and sixes The pot affixes'... 
Poetry. I learned that at my grandma's 
knee.

WILSON
That's why I keep losing. My grandma 
was a modest woman -- nobody ever 
saw her knees, not even my grandpop.

INT. WALTER BURNS' OFFICE MED. SHOT

The doctor has gone. Burns is adjusting his shirt. Bruce is 
sitting at the desk.

BRUCE
I don't know. This makes me feel 
funny.

TWO SHOT

BURNS
Why shouldn't I make Hildy my 
beneficiary? I've got nobody else to 
leave it to.

BRUCE
I feel I ought to take care of her.

BURNS
Well, you'll take care of her. After 
all, if that doctor's right, I'm 
going to live for a long time yet. 
Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. 
I was a very bad husband: Hildy could 
have got a lot of alimony if she'd 
wanted to, but she wouldn't take 
any. She had it coming to her, but 
she was too independent.

BRUCE
Well, I'm independent, too.

BURNS
Figure it this way: I ought to be 
good for twenty-five years. By that 
time, you'll probably have made enough 
so that the money won't mean anything. 
But suppose you haven't made good -- 
don't you think Hildy's entitled to 
a quiet old age without any worries?

BRUCE
Well, of course, if you put it that 
way.

BURNS
(everything he has on 
the ball)
And remember this, Bruce! I love 
her, too.

BRUCE
I'm beginning to realize that.

BURNS
And the beauty of it is she'll never 
have to know 'till I've passed on. 
Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- 
after I'm gone.

BRUCE
(a lump in his throat)
Gee, you almost make me feel like a 
heel -- coming between you.

BURNS
No, Bruce, you didn't come between 
us. It was all over for her before 
you came on the scene. For me -- 
it'll never be over.

He turns away, wipes his eyes, and sneaks a glance to see 
how that goes over. It goes over big -- Bruce hurriedly wipes 
a tear away.

MED. SHOT

as Duffy comes into the room. He advances toward the desk.

DUFFY
(placing check on 
desk)
Here's that certified check, Walter.
(sotto voce)
I drew out my wife's savings, and if 
this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined 
man!

BURNS
(also sotto voce)
Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it 
back by five.
(louder)
Thanks, Duffy. Stick around.
(picking up check he 
rises)

He walks over to Bruce.

BURNS
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified 
and everything.

BRUCE
(also rising)
Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel 
ashamed to think she hadn't trusted 
you.

CLOSEUP DUFFY

He reacts to this sweetly solemn thought.

BURNS AND BRUCE

CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM as Burns walks Bruce toward door, his 
arm around him.

BRUCE
Well, she'll know some day.

BURNS
That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.

He releases Bruce, runs back and gets umbrella and brings it 
to him.

BURNS
Don't want to forget this, you know. 
Might start to rain again.

BRUCE
Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away 
to get that story.

They are at the door. Burns opens the door for Bruce.

SHOT FEATURING LOUIS

Louis is sitting at a desk, apparently engrossed in a 
newspaper. He is all alert, however. Bruce and Burns come 
into the scene talking.

BURNS
Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting 
a good man.

BRUCE
(embarrassed)
Thanks a lot.

They pass Louis. He looks up.

BRUCE AND BURNS

Bruce, still embarrassed, looks down. Burns turns and signals 
to Louis.

CLOSE SHOT LOUIS

watching.

CLOSE SHOT BURNS

Burns points to Bruce's back.

CLOSE SHOT LOUIS

Louis nods.

BRUCE AND BURNS

BURNS
Well, I got to get back. You can 
find your way out, can't you?

BRUCE
Oh, sure.
(he extends his hand)
Well, thanks for everything.

BURNS
Don't thank me. I should thank you. 
So long.

BRUCE
So long.

He turns and goes. Burns watches him.

REVERSE ANGLE

Bruce is going out, his back toward Camera. Burns watches. 
Louis comes between Burns and Bruce and follows Bruce out as 
we see Bruce going toward outer door.

CLOSEUP BURNS

He rubs his hands in glee as he starts back for his office.

INT. PRESS ROOM SHOT FEATURING HILDY

She is raking in a pot.

HILDY
I don't know why you boys are so 
good to me.

MCCUE
(throwing cards down)
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. 
Lend me two bucks, will you?

HILDY
Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.

There is a whirr and crash from the gallows. They start.

A phone rings. McCue answers it.

For you, Hildy.

Hildy goes toward phone.

CLOSE SHOT HILDY AT PHONE

HILDY
Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. 
Have you got it? Is it certified?

INT. PHONE BOOTH CLOSE SHOT BRUCE

BRUCE
Certified and everything. Got it 
right here in my wallet... What? No, 
he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.

INT. PRESS ROOM CLOSE SHOT HILDY AT PHONE

McCue is hovering near.

MCCUE
Certified, eh? Who is it -- your 
milkman?

HILDY
(in phone)
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your 
wallet!... Well, you see --
(she is thinking 
rapidly)
-- there's an old newspaper 
superstition that the first big check 
you get you -- you put in the lining 
of your hat. That brings you good 
luck for ten years.

MCCUE
Say, I've been a reporter twenty 
years and never heard any hooey like 
that. Where'd you get it?

HILDY
(to McCue)
I made it up just now, and who's 
asking you?
(into phone)
I know it's silly, honey, but do it 
for me, won't you?... Yes, right 
now.

INT. PHONE BOOTH CLOSE SHOT BRUCE

BRUCE
All right. Wait a minute.

He takes check out of wallet, folds it into lining of hat.

BRUCE
All right. I've done it. Now, are 
you satisfied?

INT. PRESS ROOM CLOSE SHOT HILDY AT PHONE

HILDY
Fine. And here's a kiss for you.

She blows a kiss into the phone. Immediately we hear kiss 
sounds all over. She looks up and glares. Then back to phone:

HILDY
Now, darling, you go back to the 
hotel and pack and you and Mother 
pick me up here about half-past five. 
Goodbye, dear.

INT. PHONE BOOTH CLOSE SHOT BRUCE

He blows a kiss into the phone and hangs up.

EXT. OUTSIDE RESTAURANT LOUIS

Studying a paper, reads it for a moment. Bruce comes out of 
restaurant and starts out. After a second, Louis follows 
him.

INT. ENTRANCE TO A CELL BLOCK OF COUNTY JAIL MED. SHOT

Warden Cooley sits at a desk near the grilled doorway that 
leads to the cells. He is studying a Racing Form. Hildy's 
hand reaches into the shot and flicks the newspaper. He looks 
up. THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Hildy.

COOLEY
Hello, Hildy! What are you doing 
around here?

HILDY
I want to interview Earl Williams, 
Warden. How about a little service?

COOLEY
No more interviews. Besides, a 
doctor's coming over.

Hildy reaches down out of camera range -- comes up with bill.

HILDY
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?

COOLEY
(looks at bill eagerly)
I think it is.

HILDY
(handing it over)
I thought so. Come on, I'm in a hurry.

Cooley pockets the twenty and reaches for his key ring.

EXT. STREET SCENE

There is a milling mob around a center of activity that the 
Camera can't find.

SHOT OF COP

as he sees this and strolls determinedly toward it.

THE CROWD

The cop comes in and breaks ranks. He pushes his way toward 
center and looks down.

CLOSE SHOT BRUCE

lying down, held by Louis.

MED. SHOT

COP
What's going on?

LOUIS
This guy stole my watch.

COP
(lugging them both to 
feet)
Have you got his watch?

BRUCE
He's crazy. I haven't any watch.

LOUIS
I saw him. He put it in his back 
pocket.

BRUCE
I haven't got --

COP
Wait a minute.

The cop reaches into Bruce's back pocket. Watch comes out.

COP
(to Louis)
Is this yours?

LOUIS
Yeah! That's it!

COP
What about it?

BRUCE
I never saw it before.

Cop grabs Bruce. Louis grabs his other arm.

COP
Come on!

He whistles.

COP
(to mob)
Beat it!

CLOSE SHOT THREE

as they go through crowd. The look on poor Bruce's face, 
muddy anyhow, is something. Suddenly, Bruce cries:

BRUCE
My hat!

COP
Get his hat, somebody.

CLOSEUP BRUCE'S HAT

lying top up, in a puddle. Hand reaches in and picks it up.

CLOSE SHOT THREE

as hat is passed to cop, who jams it down on Bruce's head. 
Another takem from Bruce.

INT. COUNTY JAIL MED. CLOSE SHOT

at the door of Earl Williams' cell. Hildy sits on a stool at 
the door, pencil and copy paper in hand. Earl Williams sits 
at the edge of his cot, facing Hildy. There is a bouquet of 
roses in a water pitcher by the cot. Our first impression of 
Williams is that he's a rational, well-poised citizen. It is 
only under Hildy's questioning that he gradually reveals 
himself.

WILLIAMS
I couldn't plead insanity, because 
you see I'm just as sane as anybody 
else.

HILDY
(puzzled and worried)
You didn't mean to kill that 
policeman?

WILLIAMS
Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- 
it's against everything I've ever 
stood for. They know it was an 
accident. They're not hanging me for 
that -- they're hanging me for my 
beliefs.

HILDY
What are your beliefs, Earl?

WILLIAMS
They're very simple. I believe in 
the Golden Rule. I'm not the first 
man to die for preaching it. But if 
they would only listen to it -- we 
could have a fine, decent world 
instead of this mass of hate that 
makes man do such cruel things.

HILDY
How would you go about applying the 
Golden Rule, Earl?

WILLIAMS
I'd do away with the profit system 
and have production for use only. 
There's enough food and clothing and 
shelter for everybody if we'd use 
some sense.

HILDY
(writing)
"Production for use only." Well, 
maybe that's the answer.

WILLIAMS
It's the only answer. Everything has 
a use and if we let it be used for 
its purpose, we could solve all our 
problems. Food was meant to be eaten, 
not stored away in restaurants while 
poor people starved; clothing was 
meant to be worn, not piled up in 
stores while people went naked. 
Doesn't that make sense?

CLOSEUP HILDY

HILDY
(thoughtfully)
Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.

WILLIAM'S VOICE
Just use things for what they were 
meant, that's all.

HILDY
Sure.
(she studies him a 
moment)
What's the purpose of a gun, Earl?

CLOSEUP WILLIAMS

WILLIAMS
A gun?
(he thinks -- then a 
revealing smile breaks 
out)
Why -- to shoot, of course.

MED. CLOSE TWO SHOT

HILDY
Is that how you came to shoot the 
policeman?

WILLIAMS
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun 
in my hand before and I didn't know 
what to do with it. Well, when I get 
stuck, I know that there's an answer 
for everything in production for 
use. So it came to me in a flash: 
what's a gun for? To shoot! So I 
shot. Simple isn't it?

HILDY
(writing)
Very simple, Earl.

WILLIAMS
There's nothing crazy about that, is 
there?

HILDY
No, Earl, not at all.
(she indicates the 
flowers)
Who sent you the flowers, Earl?

WILLIAMS
(reverently)
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful 
person.

HILDY
(pointing to picture 
pinned on wall)
Isn't that her picture?

WILLIAMS
(turning toward it)
Yes. Isn't she beautiful?

INSERT: PICTURE OF MOLLIE

HILDY'S VOICE
If you should be pardoned, are you 
figuring on marrying Mollie?

EARL'S VOICE
Oh, no, she's much too good for me.

HARTMAN'S VOICE
How'd you get in here?

MEDIUM SHOT

Sheriff Hartman has come into the scene. Hildy turns toward 
him.

HILDY
Same way you did.
(pointing)
Through that gate.

HARTMAN
I gave strict orders that nobody was 
to interview Williams without my 
permission.

HILDY
All right, then, I'll just run the 
story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid 
to let reporters interview his 
prisoner. Of course, with election 
coming, that might do you a lot of 
harm, but just as you say.

HARTMAN
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid 
of anything. What were you going to 
write about Williams?

HILDY
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state 
had proved he was sane -- and he 
admits it himself. If you don't want 
me to run it --

HARTMAN
(beaming)
Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go 
ahead, run it. And you can say I 
treated him well, too.
(turning toward 
Williams)
'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?

WILLIAMS
Fine, thanks, Sheriff.

HARTMAN
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got 
another alienist to see you. He ought 
to be here any minute. Don't go to 
sleep, will you?

WILLIAMS
I won't.

HARTMAN
(to Hildy)
Hildy, how'd you like a couple of 
tickets for the hanging?

HILDY
(in a low voice so 
Williams won't 
overhear)
No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town 
tonight.

HARTMAN
(just as loud as ever)
You ought to stay over. You always 
wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.

HILDY
That's awful kind of you, Sheriff. 
I've got to get started on my 
interview. See you later.

WILLIAMS
Don't forget about production for 
use.

HILDY
I won't, Earl.
(she goes)

INT. PRESS ROOM GROUP SHOT POKER GAME - NIGHT

The game is on. Bensinger, at his desk, is reading a book. 
The electric lights have been switched on.

MURPHY
(raking in a pot)
Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't 
around.

ENDICOTT
Who's this guy she's gonna marry?

WILSON
Baldwin -- his name is.

SCHWARTZ
I give that marriage six months.

MCCUE
Why?

SCHWARTZ
Hildy won't be able to stay away 
from a paper any longer than that. 
Did you see her eyes light up when 
she came in here? Like an old fire 
horse.

MURPHY
She says she's gonna write fiction.

ENDICOTT
Well, if she's gonna write fiction, 
there's nothing like being a reporter.

SCHWARTZ
I'll give ten to five that marriage 
won't last six months. Hildy's a 
newspaper man. She's got headlines 
in her veins -- the way we all have 
or we'd be out of these lousy jobs.

Mollie Malloy appears in doorway. She moves slowly into the 
room.

MCCUE
Well, well -- Miss Mollie Malloy.

MURPHY
Hello, Mollie.

WILSON
How's tricks, Mollie?

CLOSE SHOT MOLLIE

MOLLIE
I've been lookin' for you tramps.

MED. GROUP SHOT

ENDICOTT
Kid, those were pretty roses you 
sent Earl. What do you want done 
with them tomorrow morning?

MOLLIE
(tensely)
A lot of wise guys, ain't you?

SCHWARTZ
(uncomfortably)
You're breaking up the game, Mollie. 
What do you want?

MOLLIE
I want to tell you what I think of 
you -- all of you.

Hildy appears in the doorway and comes into the room.

MURPHY
Keep your shirt on.

MOLLIE
(to Murphy)
If you was worth breaking my fingers 
on, I'd tear your face wide open.

Hildy goes to desk and begins typing away.

MURPHY
What are you sore about, sweetheart? 
Wasn't that a swell story we gave 
you?

MOLLIE
You crumbs have been making a fool 
out of me long enough!

BENSINGER
(rising and coming 
over)
She oughtn't be allowed in here!

CLOSEUP MOLLIE

MOLLIE
(flaring)
I never said I loved Earl Williams 
and was willing to marry him on the 
gallows! You made that up! And about 
my being his soul-mate and having a 
love-nest with him.

CLOSE SHOT ENDICOTT

looking up at her.

ENDICOTT
You've been sucking around that cuckoo 
ever since he's been in the death-
house. Everybody knows you're his 
sweetheart.

CLOSEUP MOLLIE

She blows up.

MOLLIE
That's a lie! I met Mr. Williams 
just once in my life when he was 
wandering around in the rain without 
his hat and coat on, like a sick 
dog, the day before the shooting. I 
went up to him like any human being 
would and I asked him what was the 
matter, and he told me about being 
fired after working at the same place 
for fourteen years, and I brought 
him up to my room because it was 
warm there.

CLOSE SHOT HILDY

She is typing away, stops to look over at Mollie, then 
resolutely turns away, studies her stuff, and begins typing 
again.

MURPHY'S VOICE
Aw, put it on a phonograph!

MED. SHOT MOLLIE AND OTHERS

MOLLIE
Just because you want to fill your 
lying paper with a lot of dirty 
scandal, you got to crucify him and 
make a stooge out of me!

ENDICOTT
(to Mollie)
Got a match?

MOLLIE
(heedless)
I tell you he just sat there talking 
to me -- all night. And never once 
laid a hand on me. In the morning he 
went away, and I never saw him again 
till that day at the trial!

The boys laugh.

CLOSEUP MOLLIE

She lashes out at them.

MOLLIE
Go on, laugh! I'd like to know some 
curses bad enough for your greasy 
souls! Sure, I was his witness -- 
the only one he had. Yes -- me -- 
cheap little Mollie Malloy! I'm 
everything the District Attorney 
said I was. And still I was the only 
one with guts enough to stand up for 
him! I told the truth and the District 
Attorney knows it! That's why you're 
persecutin' me! Because Earl Williams 
treated me decent and not like an 
animal -- and I said so!

MEDIUM SHOT

MURPHY
(finally irritated)
Go into your dance! This is the Press 
Room. We're busy.

WILSON
Why don't you go and see your boy-
friend?

ENDICOTT
(winks at the others)
But you'll have to hurry up -- he 
left a call for seven A.M.

MOLLIE
(through her teeth)
It's a wonder a bolt of lightning 
don't come down and strike you all 
dead!

From o.s. comes sound of the gallows. Mollie gasps.

ENDICOTT
(suddenly uncomfortable)
Don't get hysterical, kid.

MOLLIE
(begins to sob)
Shame on you!

CLOSE SHOT MOLLIE -- TAKING IN MURPHY

MOLLIE
(hysterically)
A poor little fellow that never meant 
nobody no harm! Sitting there alone 
this minute with the Angel of Death 
beside him, and you cracking jokes!

CLOSEUP HILDY

typing away furiously, regardless of this. She ends a page. 
The sound of Mollie sobbing comes over the scene. Hildy 
inserts a fresh page.

MURPHY'S VOICE
If you don't shut up, we'll give you 
something to cry about!

Hildy looks o.s. and rises determinedly.

MEDIUM SHOT - MOLLIE BACKING AWAY FROM MURPHY

She is still sobbing. Hildy comes into scene and puts her 
arm around Mollie.

HILDY
(gently)
Come on, Mollie. This is no place 
for you.
(she leads Mollie 
toward door)

MOLLIE
They're not human!

HILDY
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They 
can't help themselves. The Lord made 
them that way.

MOLLIE
(one look back as 
Hildy leads her out 
door)
It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!

Hildy and Mollie exit. There is a pause. The boys look at 
each other uncomfortably. The phone rings. Wilson goes to 
answer.

MURPHY
(picking up cards)
You guys wanna play some more poker?

ENDICOTT
What's the use? I can't win a pot.

CLOSE SHOT WILSON AT PHONE

WILSON
(into phone)
Who? Hildy Johnson? She just stepped 
out. She'll be back in a second. 
Who? Oh, Mr. Baldwin. Well, if you'll 
hang on a minute, she ought to be 
right in. All right.
(he covers transmitter)

MED. SHOT TAKING DOOR

WILSON
(to others)
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- 
himself.

SCHWARTZ
What's he want?

WILSON
Wants Hildy -- and sounds very 
excited.

Hildy comes back. Looks at them and stares contemptuously.

HILDY
Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking 
on somebody who can't defend himself -- 
the littler the better.

WILSON
Phone for you, Hildy.

HILDY
(going toward it)
Who is it?

WILSON
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?

HILDY
(grabbing phone)
Give me that!

CLOSEUP HILDY

HILDY
(into phone)
Hello! Hello! Bruce?... what?... 
Where are you?... You're where?... 
How did that happen?...
(she listens 
unbelievingly a second)
I'll be right over!

MED. SHOT

as Hildy hangs up and darts out of room. The others watch in 
amazement.

MURPHY
Boy, did you see her go?

ENDICOTT
Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.

WILSON
I told you Baldwin was in trouble.

MCCUE
Probably went out without his hankie 
and wants Mamma to wipe his nose.

SCHWARTZ
I still give that marriage six months.

DISSOLVE TO:

CLOSE SHOT BENSINGER

at phone.

BENSINGER
Hello, baby, get me the Sheriff's 
offico, will you... Hello, Sheriff 
Hartman?... This is Bensinger. How 
about that favor? You know what: 
once and for all, will you hang this 
guy at five A.M. instead of seven? 
It won't hurt you and we can make 
the City Edition.

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE CLOSE SHOT SHERIFF HARTMAN

at phone.

HARTMAN
(indignantly)
Once and for all, I'm not going to 
hang anybody except at the legal 
hour... What? Don't threaten me, 
Bensinger! I'm not afraid of any 
newspapers. Yeah?... Oh, shut up!
(he hangs up; an 
afterthought -- he 
calls up operator)
And, operator, I told you not to 
disturb me! I don't care who calls -- 
I don't want to be disturbed again 
till I tell you!
(he hangs up -- turns 
to somebody o.s. and 
speaks)
How do you like that, Dr. Egelhoffer? 
Want me to hang williams at their 
convenience!

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO A MED. GROUP SHOT, showing Williams, 
Sheriff Hartman and Dr. Egelhoffer. They are the only 
occupants of room. Williams is seated facing a large standing 
searchlight.

EGELHOFFER
The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the 
scum of modern civilization.

HARTMAN
You said it!

EGELHOFFER
They're always after me for 
interviews.

HARTMAN
Me, too.

EGELHOFFER
(fencing)
Of course, I sort of promised them I 
would give out a statement when I 
got through here. You don't mind?

HARTMAN
(not liking it)
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. 
You see, all statements are supposed 
to come from me.

EGELHOFFER
(he'll bargain)
We'll have to satisfy them. What 
would you say to giving them a joint 
interview? I could give them some of 
the psychological aspects of the 
case and you could give them the 
legal aspects.

HARTMAN
(he buys)
A joint interview, eh? That might be 
all right. We could have our pictures 
taken together, Doctor.

EGELHOFFER
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a 
very good picture, though.

HARTMAN
It doesn't matter. The publicity's 
the main thing.

EGELHOFFER
Yes, I suppose so. It all helps.

WILLIAMS
(just a spectator up 
to now)
Are you gentlemen all through with 
me?

EGELHOFFER
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were 
here. No, Mr. Williams, we still 
have some questions for you. Sheriff, 
will you kindly extinguish the lights?

The Sheriff puts out the lights and the Doctor switches on 
the searchlight, which shines in Williams' face.

EGELHOFFER
You know you are to be executed, Mr. 
Williams. Who do you feel is 
responsible for that?

WILLIAMS
The system. But I'm not afraid to 
die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I 
believe.

EGELHOFFER
I see. You realize, however, that 
you committed a crime?

CLOSEUP WILLIAMS

WILLIAMS
In a legal sense, yes. But not 
actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I 
didn't do anything.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. POLICE CELL CLOSEUP BRUCE

BRUCE
I'm innocent. I didn't do anything. 
I never stole a watch in my life.

CAMERA PULLS BACK to show us Bruce in police cell. Hildy 
outside. A police lieutenant with her in b.g.

HILDY
I know you didn't, Bruce.

She whirls on lieutenant.

HILDY
(to lieutenant)
Let him out of here, Lieutenant.

LIEUTENANT
(conciliatingly)
But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of 
stealing a watch. And they found the 
watch on him.

HILDY
And who accused him? Diamond Louis! 
One of the worst crooks in town! Why 
don't you arrest Louis instead of 
innocent people that he frames?

LIEUTENANT
Now, Hildy --

HILDY
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let 
him out?

LIEUTENANT
I can't.

HILDY
All right. You can't. But tomorrow 
the Post will run the story of that 
roulette game on 43rd Street that 
your brother-in-law runs. And we'll 
print that you get five hundred a 
month for forgetting about it!

LIEUTENANT
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't 
let him out.

HILDY
You can let him out on bail, can't 
you?

LIEUTENANT
Five hundred dollars.

HILDY
You'll take fifty and like it!

LIEUTENANT
(wavers)
Well, all right. But I'm liable to 
get into a jam.

He starts to open cell door.

HILDY
You'll get into a worse one if you 
don't.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. TAXI (PROCESS SHOT)

Hildy is combing Bruce's hair. He begins to look presentable. 
He fumbles in his breast pocket.

HILDY
What's the matter?

BRUCE
I lost my wallet.

HILDY
(stops)
The check, Bruce!

Bruce picks up his hat and gets check out of lining.

BRUCE
That's right here. Gee, it was lucky 
your telling me about that old 
newspaper superstition.

HILDY
(taking check and 
putting it away)
Yes, wasn't it?

BRUCE
I can't imagine who did it. I can't 
think of any enemies I have.

HILDY
(looking at him fondly)
I'm sure you haven't any.

BRUCE
For a minute, I thought maybe Walter 
Burns was at the back of it. But 
then I realized he couldn't have 
been.

HILDY
Oh, no. How could you ever think of 
such a thing?

BRUCE
Oh, I realized right away. He's really 
a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found 
that out.

HILDY
Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're 
taking that next train -- and when I 
say next train, this time I mean it!

BRUCE
Did you finish the interview?

HILDY
(to driver)
The Criminal Courts Building.

The driver nods.

HILDY
(to Bruce)
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right 
with Walter.

BRUCE
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that 
insurance business -- and you promised --

HILDY
Well, the story's practically 
finished. I'll just go upstairs and 
send it over with a messenger.

The cab stops. Hildy gets out and Bruce starts to follow. 
Hildy turns and pushes him back in the cab.

EXT. STREET MED. SHOT HILDY

at door of cab. Bruce in cab.

HILDY
No, you stay here. I'm not taking 
any more chances. I'll be down in 
three minutes -- and don't you dare 
move!

Hildy turns and starts for stairs of Criminal Courts Building.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. PRESS ROOM MED. SHOT AT HILDY'S DESK

Schwartz is reading Hildy's interview to the other boys, who 
are grouped around. Bensinger is at his desk, a book open, 
but listening.

SCHWARTZ
(reading)
"But the State has a production for 
use plan, too. It has a gallows and 
at seven A.M., unless a miracle 
occurs, that gallows will be used to 
separate the soul of Earl Williams 
from his body. And out of Molly 
Malloy's life will go the one kindly 
soul she ever knew --"
(he stops)
That's as far as Hildy got. But, I 
ask you, can that girl write an 
interview?

BENSINGER
I don't think it's very ethical 
reading other people's stuff.

ENDICOTT
Don't give us that ethics stuff. 
You'll be the only one who'll swipe 
any of it.

SCHWARTZ
I still say anybody that writes like 
that ain't going to give it up 
permanently to sew sox for a guy in 
the insurance business. Now I give 
that marriage three months and I'm 
laying three to one. Any takers?

HILDY'S VOICE
I'll take that bet.

They turn. Hildy comes into the scene.

HILDY
(going to her phone)
It's getting so a girl can't step 
out of the room without being 
discussed by a bunch of old ladies.
(into phone; her voice 
assumes a silken 
quality)
Hello, Post... Mr. Walter Burns, 
please.

CLOSE SHOT SCHWARTZ

SCHWARTZ
(embarrassed)
Well, Hildy, we were only saying 
that a swell reporter like you 
wouldn't give this up so easily.

MED. SHOT FEATURING HILDY

HILDY
(into phone)
This is Hildy Johnson...
(to Schwartz)
Oh, I can give it up all right. 
Without a single quiver. I'm going 
to live like a human being -- not 
like you rats.
(into phone)
Oh, is that you, Walter dear? Oh, I 
didn't mean "dear." That was just 
habit, I guess. Oh, be yourself, 
Walter. I've got some news for you... 
Yes, I got the interview, but I've 
got some news that's more important.

The others are listening, suspecting a scoop.

HILDY
Better get a pencil out and write it 
down. All ready?
(then with a sudden 
change of pace)
Get this, you double-crossing 
chimpanzee, there ain't gonna be any 
interview and there ain't gonna be 
any story... Huh? That certified 
check of yours is leaving with me in 
twenty minutes. And if I ever see 
you again, it's going to be just too 
bad... Eh?... Oh, you don't know 
what I'm angry about, do you? If you 
come over I'll be very glad to tell 
you the story of Louie's watch. I 
dare you to come over, you -- you -- 
skunk in sheep's clothing! And bring 
that bodyguard of yours, too -- you'll 
need him.

QUICK CUTS OF REACTION FROM OTHERS

CLOSEUP HILDY

HILDY
...And I just want you to listen to 
one more thing.

She gets her story out of typewriter, applies it to 
transmitter and tears it up.

HILDY
Hear that? That's the interview I 
wrote... Yes, I know we made a 
bargain. I just said I'd write it -- 
I didn't say I wouldn't tear it up. 
Yes, it's all in little pieces now, 
Walter, and I hope to do the same 
for you some time!

She hangs up.

MED. SHOT FEATURING HILDY

She reaches under her desk, pulls up bag, talking all the 
time. The others are too startled to do anything but listen.

HILDY
And that's my farewell to the 
newspaper game. I'm going to live a 
normal life and have a home.

She reaches into the drawer of desk and gets some stuff which 
she puts into bag.

HILDY
I'm going to be a woman, not a 
newsgetting machine. I'm going to 
have babies and nurse them and love 
them and give 'em cod liver oil and 
worry about their new teeth -- and 
the minute I catch one of them even 
looking at a newspaper, I'm going to 
brain him! Where's my hat?

Someone points to her hat. She rises and goes toward it. Her 
bag is still open. Her phone rings. Schwartz answers it.

SCHWARTZ
(subdued tones)
Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still 
here.

HILDY
(stopping midway to 
her hat)
I'll take it.
(she comes over to 
phone)
What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't 
you understand English? -- Why, your 
language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- 
positively shocking! I don't mind 
because I was married to you and 
know what to expect, but suppose 
Central is listening in... Oh, did 
you hear that, Central? We ought to 
report him, don't you think?... Oh, 
fooey on you!

She pulls the phone out of the wall, walks toward window and 
tosses it out of the window. She waits for the crash, turns 
back and says:

HILDY
Now where was that hat? Oh, yes.

She starts toward it.

INT. SHERIFF HARTMAN'S OFFICE MED. SHOT

WILLIAMS
I hope you're pretty nearly through 
with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little 
fatigued.

HARTMAN
Yeah, you don't want to tire him 
out, Doctor.

EGELHOFFER
Just one thing more. I'd like to 
reenact the crime, Mr. Williams. May 
I have your gun, please, Sheriff?

Hartman starts to take gun out, hesitates.

HARTMAN
I don't know --

EGELHOFFER
(insistently)
Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't 
strike in the same place twice. 
Nothing's going to happen.

Hartman hands him the gun.

EGELHOFFER
Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie 
Malloy, in whose room you were. You 
will be Earl Williams. And I will be 
the policeman. Follow me, Mr. 
Williams?

WILLIAMS
Yes, sir.

Egelhoffer hands the gun to Williams and then backs up a few 
paces.

EGELHOFFER
So -- now I say to you: 'Earl 
Williams, you are under arrest!' and 
you point your gun at me.

WILLIAMS
(hesitantly)
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --

EGELHOFFER
(insistently)
Point the gun at me!

Williams does so.

EGELHOFFER
Then what did you do?

Williams hesitates for a moment and then pulls the trigger. 
Hartman promptly dives under the desk as Egelhoffer topples 
over.

WILLIAMS
(pathetically)
Now can I go, please?

There is a loud banging on the door and a voice calling:

VOICE
Hey, Sheriff! Open up! What happened?

Williams, alarmed by voice, turns and starts toward window.

INT. PRESS ROOM MED. GROUP SHOT

Hildy is now wearing her hat and gloves. She picks up her 
bag and starts for the door.

ENDICOTT
Goodbye, Yonson.

MCCUE
So long, Hildy.

MURPHY
Send us a postcard, kid.

SCHWARTZ
Who'll keep the lamp in the window 
for you.

BENSINGER
Goodbye, Hildy.

Hildy has crossed to doorway, the CAMERA TRUCKING WITH HER. 
She turns and faces the room to make a last bravura speech.

HILDY
Well, goodbye, you wage-slaves. When 
you're crawling up fire escapes, 
getting kicked out of front doors, 
and eating Christmas dinners in one-
armed joints, don't forget your pal, 
Hildy Johnson! And, remember, my 
husband sells insurance!

She turns and starts on a bit of verse:

HILDY
"It takes a heap o' livin' to make a 
house a home."

She is interrupted by a terrific fusillade of shots in the 
courtyard. A roar of excited voices comes up. For a tense 
second, everyone is motionless. There is another volley of 
shots. Wilson, Endicott and Murphy jump for the window.

CLOSE SHOT AT WINDOW

VOICES FROM COURTYARD
Get the riot guns! Spread out, you 
fellows! Etc.

WILSON
There's a jail-break!

MURPHY
(at window, 
simultaneously)
Cooley! What's the matter What's 
happened?

VOICES FROM YARD
Watch the gate! He's probably trying 
the gate!

Outside, a siren begins to wail.

ENDICOTT
(out the window)
Who got away? Who was it?

VOICE OUTSIDE
Earl... Williams!!!

THE REPORTERS
Who? Who'd he say? Earl Williams! It 
was Earl Williams! He got away! Etc.

SHOT AT DESK

MCCUE
Holy ---! Gimme that telephone!
(works hook frantically)
Hurry! Hurry up! This is important!

MED. SHOT TAKING IN DOOR

Searchlights hit the windows, sweeping from direction of the 
jail. Hildy stands paralyzed, her bundle in her hand. There 
is another rifle volley. Two windowpanes crash into the room. 
Some plaster falls. Gongs sound above the siren. The boys 
are jumping for their telephones. Another windowpane goes.

MCCUE
(screaming)
Look out!

CLOSE SHOT AT WINDOW

MURPHY
(out the window)
Look out where you're aiming, will 
you?

A QUICK MONTAGE

of reporters at their various phones follows: "Gimme the 
desk!" "Flash!" "Earl Williams just escaped!" "Don't know 
yet -- call you back.", etc., are shouted into the phones by 
Schwartz, Wilson, McCue, Endicott, Bensinger and Murphy. 
After each man communicates with his paper, he dashes for 
the door.

MEDIUM SHOT

The last of the reporters is gone.

CLOSE SHOT - HILDY

Her bag, almost unnoticed, falls to the floor. CAMERA TRUCKS 
WITH HER as she moves back into the room, absently grabbing 
and trailing a chair.

ANOTHER ANGLE

HILDY
Ahhh --

She lets go of the chair and takes one of the telephones.

HILDY
Morning Post?... Get me Walter Burns -- 
quick! Hildy Johnson calling.

Very calmly she sits on the long table, her back against the 
wall and waits.

CLOSEUP - HILDY

HILDY
Walter?... Hildy. Earl Williams just 
escaped from the County Jail. Yep... 
yep... yep... don't worry! I'm on 
the job!

She hangs up.

MEDIUM SHOT

There is another volley outside. Hildy sails her hat and 
starts peeling off her gloves as she jumps for the door.

EXT. COURTYARD - DAY MEDIUM SHOT - AT THE GATE

There are the reporters joining armed guards who are leaping 
into squad cars ready for the chase. Cooley is beside the 
gate. As the reporters and guards pile into the cars, the 
gate opens and out they go.

MEDIUM SHOT AT DOOR LEADING FROM BUILDING TO COURTYARD

Hildy comes on a run from this door, hesitates a moment, 
then sees something o.s. and runs for it.

MED. SHOT - SQUAD CAR

as it comes careening across courtyard toward gate. Hildy 
tears into scene, jumps for and makes the running-board, and 
hangs there as the car swerves up to the gate.

MED. SHOT - AT GATE

Hildy notices Cooley as the car, gathering speed, goes by 
him. She leaps from the running-board and lands clump on 
Cooley.

CLOSE SHOT - HILDY AND COOLEY

Cooley has been knocked to the ground by the impact of Hildy's 
leap. She is sitting on him.

HILDY
Cooley, I want to talk to you.

COOLEY
(trying to get up)
Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- 
Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has 
escaped --

He struggles.

HILDY
There's money in it, Cooley.

COOLEY
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It 
means --

HILDY
(interrupting him)
A lot of money.
(she opens her bag)
Four hundred and fifty dollars --

She fingers the bills.

COOLEY
How much?

HILDY
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is 
it a deal?

COOLEY
It's a deal. Let me up.

Cooley gets up and dusts himself off.

COOLEY
Let's see the money.

HILDY
(money still in her 
hand)
First we talk. How did Earl Williams 
get that gun?

Cooley looks around quickly.

COOLEY
Come on, and I'll tell you.

He jerks his head, indicating to Hildy to follow him.

MEDIUM SHOT

They move off as the gates are closed.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. PRESS ROOM - CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING - DAY FULL SHOT

The room is empty. All the telephones are ringing crazily. 
Endicott enters hurriedly, crosses to his phone.

ENDICOTT
(into phone)
Endicott talking.

CLOSE SHOT ENDICOTT - AT PHONE

ENDICOTT
(into phone)
No -- nobody knows where he got the 
gun, but I think Mollie Malloy 
smuggled it in to him. He ran up the 
fire-escape, and went back in the 
infirmary window. Then he got out 
through the skylight. He must have 
slid down the rain-pipe to the street.

MURPHY'S VOICE
Gimme the Desk.

MED. TWO SHOT

including Murphy and Endicott at separate phones.

ENDICOTT
No, I tell you! Nobody knows where 
he got it.

MURPHY
The Crime Commission has offered a 
reward of ten thousand dollars for 
Williams' capture.

ENDICOTT
Call you back.

He hangs up swiftly and goes out.

MURPHY
No clue yet as to Earl Williams' 
whereabouts. Here's a little feature 
though: There's been an accident 
about a tear bomb --

Wilson enters and picks up his phone.

WILSON
(into phone)
Wilson talking.

MURPHY
Yeah -- tear bomb. Criminals cry for 
it.

MEDIUM SHOT

including Murphy, Wilson and doorway. The Sheriff enters, 
turning as he enters. As he turns back to someone in corridor:

HARTMAN
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where 
I am.

MURPHY
(into phone)
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly 
in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's 
Bombing Squad.

HARTMAN
What went off?

MURPHY
(into phone)
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs 
were rushed to the hospital --

HARTMAN
A fine fair-weather friend you are!

MURPHY
(remorselessly, into 
phone)
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who 
is the Mayor's brother-in-law --

HARTMAN
After all I've done for you --

MURPHY
(continuing)
Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle 
on his mother's side --

WILSON
(into phone)
Hello, Jim? Sidelights on Sheriff 
Hartman's manhunt.

The Sheriff spins around -- another enemy. At this moment 
Hildy enters the room and crosses casually to her telephone 
where she stands waiting.

MURPHY
(into phone)
William Lungren, who is the Sheriff's 
landlord, and Lester Bartow who 
married the Sheriff's niece. You 
remember, the very homely dame. Call 
you back.

He hangs up.

WILSON
(into phone)
Mrs. William Tausig, age fifty-five, 
scrub lady, while at work scrubbing 
the eighth floor of the Commerce 
Building, was shot in the left leg 
by one of Sheriff Hartman's deputies.

Hartman groans. There is a sound of machine-gun firing in 
the courtyard.

HILDY
There goes another scrub lady.

WILSON
(into phone)
I'll go right after it.

He hangs up and exits.

MURPHY
(to Hildy)
Any dope yet on how he got out?

HILDY
From all I can get the Sheriff let 
him out so's he could vote for him.

HARTMAN
I'm very disappointed in you, Hildy 
Johnson.

He turns and exits.

CLOSE SHOT AT TABLE NEAR HILDY'S PHONE

taking in Hildy and Murphy.

MURPHY
How do you suppose Williams got that 
gun?

As Hildy shrugs, there is another flurry of machine-gun fire. 
Murphy leaves precipitately. Hildy, alone at last, picks up 
the phone.

HILDY
(into phone)
Give me Walter Burns -- quick --

She lays down the telephone receiver and crosses to the door 
which she closes, then returns to the phone.

HILDY
(picking up phone)
Walter, listen. I've got the inside 
story on how Williams got the gun 
and escaped.

INT. WALTER BURNS' OFFICE - DAY CLOSE SHOT - BURNS

at his desk, telephone to his ear.

BURNS
Exclusive? That's great.

INT. PRESS ROOM - DAY CLOSE SHOT - HILDY

HILDY
It cost me four hundred and fifty 
bucks to tear it out of Cooley.

INT. BURNS' OFFICE CLOSE SHOT - BURNS

BURNS
Never mind that. What's the story?

INT. PRESS ROOM CLOSE SHOT - HILDY

HILDY
Never mind it? That's not my money! 
That's Bruce's money!

INT. BURNS' OFFICE CLOSE SHOT - BURNS

BURNS
You'll get it. Now what's the story?
(he raises his hand)
I'll have the paper send the money 
right down to you. I swear it on my 
mother's grave.

INT. PRESS ROOM CLOSE SHOT - HILDY

HILDY
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.

INT. BURNS' OFFICE CLOSE SHOT - BURNS

BURNS
I meant on my grandmother's grave. 
Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's 
the story?!

INT. PRESS ROOM CLOSE SHOT - HILDY

HILDY
Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, 
from New York, decides to make 
Williams re-enact the crime --

She starts to giggle at the thought.

HILDY
Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the 
Professor had to have a gun to re-
enact the crime with -- and who do 
you suppose supplied it? Nobody else 
but that great thinker, Sheriff 
Hartman!

INT. BURNS' OFFICE CLOSE SHOT - BURNS

BURNS
(laughing)
No kidding, Hildy.
(suspiciously)
Say, this isn't a rib?

INT. PRESS ROOM CLOSE SHOT - HILDY

HILDY
No, this is on the level, Walter. 
I'm not good enough to make this one 
up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the 
Professor, the Professor gave it to 
Earl, and Earl gave it right back to 
the Professor -- right in the stomach! 
Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. 
They took him to the County Hospital 
where they're afraid he'll recover.

INT. BURNS' OFFICE CLOSE SHOT - BURNS

BURNS
That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, 
will you stop worrying about the 
money? I'll see you get it in fifteen 
minutes.

INT. PRESS ROOM CLOSE SHOT - HILDY

HILDY
It better be fifteen minutes, because 
Bruce is waiting downstairs in a 
taxicab and that meter's clicking 
away to beat the band.

INT. BURNS' OFFICE CLOSE SHOT BURNS

BURNS
Hold on a minute.

CAMERA PULLS BACK disclosing Louis and a blonde sitting on a 
divan in Walter's office. Burns' beckons the blonde:

BURNS
(his hand carefully 
over receiver of 
phone)
Come here. There's a guy waiting in 
a taxi in front of the Criminal Courts 
building. His name is Bruce Baldwin. 
Can you do your stuff?

BLONDE
I've never flopped on you, have I?

BURNS
Then scram! You've got about two 
minutes.

She exits.

BURNS
(into phone)
Sorry to keep you waiting. How much 
was it again? Four hundred and fifty 
dollars? Hang on a second.

He puts his hand over the phone again and beckons to Louis.

BURNS
(to Louis)
I need four hundred and fifty dollars 
in counterfeit money. You know where 
I can get it?

LOUIS
It's awful funny -- I happen to have 
some on me.

BURNS
(into phone)
It's coming right over. I'm sending 
it over with Louis. Thanks for the 
story and good luck on your honeymoon.

INT. PRESS ROOM MED. SHOT HILDY AT TELEPHONE

HILDY
Keep the thanks, but just see that 
the money gets here!

She hangs up. The door opens and McCue enters and crosses to 
his phone.

MCCUE
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were 
gone.

HILDY
I thought so, too.

Hildy takes a look at the clock, rises and begins to pace up 
and down, pounding her hands together.

CLOSE SHOT MCCUE AT PHONE

MCCUE
(into phone)
McCue speaking. Mrs. Phoebe DeWolfe, 
eight-sixty-one and a half South 
State Street, colored, gave birth to 
a pickaninny in a patrol wagon with 
Sheriff Hartman's special Rifle Squad 
acting as nurses. Well -- Phoebe was 
walking along the street when all of 
a sudden she began -- that's right. 
So the police coaxed her into the 
patrol wagon and they started a race 
with the stork. When the pickaninny 
was born the Rifle Squad examined 
him carefully to see if it was Earl 
Williams who they knew was hiding 
somewhere.

MED. SHOT

Hildy is still pacing. McCue laughs at his own joke.

MCCUE
(to Hildy)
Did you get that, Hildy?

HILDY
No -- what?

Hildy's phone rings. She answers.

CLOSE SHOT HILDY AT PHONE

HILDY
Hello -- Bruce! I thought you were 
downstairs in a -- What? Arrested 
again! What for this time, Bruce? 
Mashing! Oh, Bruce, can't I leave 
you alone for three minutes even? 
Well, where are you? The 27th 
Precinct? All right, I'll be right 
over --
(she breaks off and 
looks down at her 
bag on the desk)
I'll be over in twenty minutes, Bruce.
(she hangs up)
If I ever see Walter Burns --
(she picks up phone 
and dials viciously)
Get me Walter Burns... Hildy Johnson! 
Well, he was there just a minute 
ago! Have him call me back!

She hangs up.

MEDIUM SHOT

HILDY
(to McCue)
If Walter Burns calls, hold the wire 
for me, will you? I'll be right back.
(she goes out)

MCCUE
Okay, Hildy.
(into phone)
Well, we can't get any official 
statement --

MEDIUM SHOT ANOTHER ANGLE

The door opens and the Mayor enters.

MCCUE
(into phone)
Oh, wait a minute -- here's the Mayor. 
Maybe he'll give us one.

CLOSEUP THE MAYOR

turning away with a wave of his hand.

MAYOR
Don't pester me now, please. I got a 
lot on my mind.

CLOSEUP MCCUE

MCCUE
(into phone)
His Honor won't say anything.

He hangs up and exits out of scene.

MED. CLOSE SHOT MAYOR TAKING IN DOOR

McCue comes in to him. Murphy and Endicott come in.

MAYOR
(to McCue)
Have you seen Sheriff Hartman?

MCCUE
It's hard to say, Your Honor. The 
place is so full of cockroaches.

MURPHY
Say, Your Honor, what effect's this 
jail-break going to have on the 
colored voters?

CLOSEUP THE MAYOR

MAYOR
Not an iota. In what way can an 
unavoidable misfortune of this sort 
influence the duty of every citizen, 
colored or otherwise?

MED. SHOT INCLUDING GROUP

ENDICOTT
Your Honor, is there a Red Menace or 
ain't there?

The Sheriff comes scooting in.

MAYOR
(to the Sheriff)
Hartman, I've been looking for you!

He closes in on the Sheriff, followed by the reporters.

MURPHY
So have we!

ENDICOTT
What's the dope, Sheriff?

MURPHY
Who engineered this getaway?

CLOSE SHOT

HARTMAN
Just a minute! We've got him located.

ENDICOTT
Williams?

MURPHY
Where is he?

HARTMAN
Where he used to live. You can catch 
the Riot Squad -- it's just going 
out.

The boys beat it, fast.

MAYOR
Pete, I want to talk to you!

HARTMAN
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll 
see you after.

MAYOR
Did you actually give Williams that 
gun?

HARTMAN
(a wail)
The professor asked me for it -- I 
thought it was for something 
scientific!

MAYOR
Pete, I've got a mighty unpleasant 
task to perf --

The Sheriff suddenly nudges him for quiet, and the Mayor, 
turning, sees:

ANOTHER ANGLE FEATURING SCHWARTZ

coming in and going to the phone. He is whistling.

SCHWARTZ
Hiya, Your Honor.
(into phone)
Schwartz calling.
(to the Mayor)
How about it, Your Honor? Any 
statement on the Red uprising 
tomorrow?

MAYOR
What Red uprising?

HARTMAN
There'll be no Red uprising!

SCHWARTZ
(into phone)
Gimme rewrite --
(to the Mayor)
The Governor says the situation calls 
for the militia.

MAYOR
You can quote me as saying that 
anything the Governor says is a tissue 
of lies.

SCHWARTZ
(into phone)
Hello, Jake. Here's a red-hot 
statement from the Governor. He claims 
that the Mayor and the Sheriff have 
shown themselves to be a couple of 
eight-year-olds playing with fire.

CLOSEUP SHERIFF AND MAYOR

SCHWARTZ' VOICE
Quote him as follows: "It is a lucky 
thing for the city that next Tuesday 
is Election Day, as the citizens 
will thus be saved the expense of 
impeaching the Mayor and the Sheriff." 
That's all -- call you back.

MED. SHOT SCHWARTZ

He hangs up and starts out.

SCHWARTZ
Nice to have seen you, Mayor.

He exits, whistling.

MAYOR
We've got to go somewhere private, 
Pete. I've got to talk to you straight 
from the shoulder.

They start out.

MED. SHOT SHERIFF AND MAYOR

As they start for the door it opens. As they exit Hildy 
enters, almost crossing them but not quite noticing them as 
she starts pounding her hands together and pacing up and 
down Press Room.

MED. SHOT MAYOR AND SHERIFF

as they start down the hall, CAMERA TRUCKING WITH THEM.

HARTMAN
(beside himself)
Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a 
few hours before you make any 
decisions. I'll get results. I'm 
doing everything humanly possible. 
I've just sworn in four hundred 
deputies.

MAYOR
Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt 
this administration?

HARTMAN
(pleadingly)
I'm getting them for twelve dollars 
a night.

MAYOR
Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic 
uncles of yours?
(gesturing)
Out shooting everybody they see for 
the fun of it?

HARTMAN
(with dignity)
If you're talking about my brother-
in-law, he's worked for the city 
fifteen years.

They come to the door of the Sheriff's office. Hartman opens 
door and the Mayor enters, Hartman following.

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE MED. CLOSE SHOT

Hartman closes door and turns to Mayor, who faces him 
portentously.

MAYOR
Pete, you're through!

HARTMAN
(stunned)
What do you mean -- through?

MAYOR
I mean I'm scratching your name off 
the ticket Tuesday and running 
Czernecki in your place. It's nothing 
personal. And, Pete -- it's the only 
way out. It's a sacrifice we all 
ought to be glad to make.

HARTMAN
(David to Jonathan)
Fred!

MAYOR
Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my 
Sentimental side.

HARTMAN
Fred, I don't know what to say. A 
thing like this almost destroys a 
man's faith in human nature.

MAYOR
I wish you wouldn't talk like that, 
Pete.

HARTMAN
Our families, Fred. I've always looked 
on Bessie as my own sister.

MAYOR
(wavering and desperate)
If there was any way out...

As a phone rings:

HARTMAN
There is a way out. I've got Williams 
surrounded, haven't I? What more do 
you want?
(into phone)
Hello... Yes... Hello!
(wildly)
Four hundred suppers! Nothing doing! 
This is a man-hunt -- not a 
banquet!... The twelve dollars 
includes everything!!

He hangs up.

HARTMAN
That gives you an idea of what I'm 
up against!

MAYOR
(hotly)
We're up against a lot more than 
that with that nutty slogan you 
invented: 'Reform the Reds With a 
Rope'.

Sheriff winces.

MAYOR
Williams ain't a Red, and you know 
it!

HARTMAN
Well, there's a lot of Communistic 
sympathizers around --

MAYOR
I know it! But they've got nothing 
to do with this case! Do you realize 
there are two hundred thousand votes 
at stake and unless we hang Earl 
Williams we're going to lose 'em?

HARTMAN
But we're going to hang him, Fred. 
He can't get away.

A knock on the door.

MAYOR
What do you mean he can't get away?! 
He got away, didn't he?

Knocking louder.

MAYOR
Who's out there?

VOICE OUTSIDE (PINKUS)
Is Sheriff Hartman in there?

Sheriff starts for door.

HARTMAN
(relieved)
Ah! For me!

MED. SHOT TAKING IN DOOR

Sheriff opens the door. A small, very colorless and 
ineffectual man named Pinkus is there.

HARTMAN
(as he opens door, 
disclosing Pinkus)
I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?

PINKUS
(coming in)
You're certainly a hard fellow to 
find, Sheriff.

MAYOR
(annoyed)
What do you want?

PINKUS
(taking a document 
from his pocket and 
proffering it to 
Sheriff)
I'm a messenger at the State House. 
This is from the Governor.

MAYOR
What's from the Governor?

PINKUS
The reprieve for Earl Williams.

HARTMAN
(stunned)
For who?

PINKUS
(amiably)
Earl Williams. The reprieve.

MAYOR
W-wait a minute.

Getting his bearings.

HARTMAN
(bursting forth)
The Governor gave me his word of 
honor he wouldn't interfere. Two 
days ago!

MAYOR
And you fell for it, Pete. It 
frightens me what I'd like to do to 
you.
(to Pinkus)
Who else knows about this?

The Sheriff, with shaking hands, opens and begins to read 
the thing.

PINKUS
They were all standing around when 
he wrote it. It was after they got 
back from fishing.

MAYOR
(to Sheriff)
Get the Governor on the phone!

PINKUS
(helpfully)
You can't get him on the phone. He's 
out duckshooting now.

MAYOR
Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you 
like that. A guy does nothing more 
strenuous for forty years than play 
pinochle -- he gets elected Governor 
and right away he thinks he's Tarzan!

HARTMAN
(thrusting the document 
at the Mayor)
Read it! Insane, he says.
(shaking a finger in 
Pinkus' face)
He knows very well that Williams 
ain't insane!

PINKUS
Yeah. But I --

MAYOR
(interrupting)
Pure politics!

HARTMAN
An attempt to ruin us!

The phone rings. Hartman starts for it.

MAYOR
(reading)
Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!

HARTMAN
We got to think fast before those 
lying reporters get hold of this. 
What'll we tell 'em?

MAYOR
Tell 'em the party is through in 
this State on account of you.

HARTMAN
Ah, Fred --
(into phone)
Hello... this is Hartman --

MAYOR
(apoplectic)
And you can tell 'em as an 
afterthought that I want your 
resignation now!

HARTMAN
(from the phone)
Sssh. Wait, Fred.
(excitedly, into phone)
What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!

MAYOR
What is it?

HARTMAN
They got him!
(back to phone)
Wait a minute -- hold the wire.
(to the Mayor)
They got Earl Williams surrounded -- 
the Riot Squad has -- in his house.

MAYOR
Tell 'em to hold the wire.

HARTMAN
I did.
(into phone)
Hold the wire.

MAYOR
Cover up that transmitter!

Sheriff does so. Mayor faces Cooney.

MAYOR
Now, listen! You never arrived here 
with this -- reprieve. Get it?

PINKUS
(blinking)
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you 
remember?

MAYOR
How much do you make a week?

PINKUS
Huh?

MAYOR
(impatiently)
How much do you make a week? What's 
your salary?

PINKUS
(reluctantly)
Forty dollars.

HARTMAN
(into phone)
No -- don't out me off.

MAYOR
How would you like to have a job for 
three hundred and fifty dollars a 
month. That's almost a hundred dollars 
a week!

PINKUS
Who? Me?

MAYOR
(exasperated)
Who do you think!

Pinkus is a little startled; the Mayor hastens to adopt a 
milder manner.

MAYOR
Now, listen. There's a fine opening 
for a fellow like you in the City 
Sealer's office.

PINKUS
The what?

MAYOR
The City Sealer's office!

PINKUS
You mean here in the city?

MAYOR
(foaming)
Yes, yes!

HARTMAN
(at phone)
Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm 
in conference.

PINKUS
(a very deliberate 
intellect)
No, I couldn't do that.

MAYOR
Why not?

PINKUS
I couldn't work in the city. You 
see, I've got my family in the 
country.

MAYOR
(desperate)
But you could bring 'em in here! 
We'll pay all your expenses.

PINKUS
(with vast thought)
No, I don't think so.

MAYOR
For heaven's sake, why not?

PINKUS
I got two kids going to school there, 
and if I changed them from one town 
to another, they'd lose a grade.

MAYOR
No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain 
one! And I guarantee that they'll 
graduate with highest honors!

PINKUS
(lured)
Yeah?

HARTMAN
(into phone)
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? 
Hurry up, Fred!

MAYOR
Now what do you say?

PINKUS
This puts me in a peculiar hole.

MAYOR
No, it doesn't.
(hands him the reprieve)
Now, remember: you never delivered 
this.
(rushing him to the 
door)
You got caught in the traffic, or 
something.
(opening door)
Now, get out of here and don't let 
anybody see you.

PINKUS
But how do I know...?

MAYOR
Come in and see me in my office 
tomorrow. What's your name?

PINKUS
Pinkus.

MAYOR
(taking out his wallet)
All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've 
got to do is lay low and keep your 
mouth shut. Here!
(he hands him a card)
Go to this address. It's a nice, 
homey little place, and they'll take 
care of you for the night. Just tell 
'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty 
dollars on account.

He pushes money into Pinkus's hand and pushes him through 
the door. Pinkus goes.

HARTMAN
(into phone, 
desperately)
Will you wait, Olsen? I'll tell you 
in a minute!

The door opens again and Pinkus comes back in.

PINKUS
You forgot to tell me what a City 
Sealer has to do.

MAYOR
(turning hastily toward 
Pinkus)
I'll explain it tomorrow!

PINKUS
Is it hard?

MAYOR
No! It's easy -- it's very easy!

HARTMAN
(pleadingly, into 
phone)
Just one second --

PINKUS
That's good, because my health ain't 
what it used to be.

MAYOR
(pushing him out the 
door)
We'll fix that, too.
(he closes the door 
after him)

HARTMAN
(into phone -- one 
more plea)
Just -- one -- second!

He turns to the Mayor with a gesture of appeal. The Mayor 
closes the door and turns to Hartman.

MAYOR
(huskily)
All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.

HARTMAN
What?

MAYOR
Shoot to kill, I said.

HARTMAN
I don't know, Fred. There's that 
reprieve if they ever find out.

MAYOR
Nobody reprieved that policeman he 
murdered. Now, do as I tell you.

HARTMAN
(into phone)
Hello, Olsen... Listen...
(his voice is weak)
Shoot to kill... That's the orders 
pass the word along... No! We dont 
want him! And listen, Olsen, five-
hundred bucks for the guy that does 
the job... Yes, I'll be right out 
there.
(hangs up)
Well, I hope that's the right thing 
to do.

MAYOR
Now take that guilty look off your 
face, Pete -- and stop trembling 
like a horse.

HARTMAN
(mopping his brow)
If we didn't have election Tuesday 
I'd have this on my conscience.

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE PRESS ROOM MED. SHOT

Louie comes from the direction of the stairs and crosses 
toward door to Press Room. He pauses a moment, puts his hand 
in his pocket, pulls out some bills, counts them and opens 
the door.

INT. PRESS ROOM MED. SHOT

Hildy is still pacing, pounding her hands together and 
glancing every so often at the clock on the wall. Suddenly 
she crosses to her phone, picks up transmitter --

HILDY
(into phone)
Will you try --

LOUIE'S VOICE
Hildy.

HILDY
(wheeling towards 
door)
Louie!

She drops the phone and hurries towards him.

HILDY
Have you got my dough?

LOUIS
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with 
it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?

HILDY
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut 
your throat if you try any tricks!

LOUIS
All right, all right. You can't blame 
a guy for tryin', can you?

HILDY
Come on with that money!

LOUIS
First you got to sign a receipt.
(he pulls out a receipt)

HILDY
Where's the money?

LOUIS
Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right 
here.
(he picks out money 
and counts)
One hundred -- two hundred -- three 
hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. 
Now sign.

HILDY
(grabs money and signs)
Here!

LOUIS
Thanks. So long, Hildy!

HILDY
(grabbing him)
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce 
Baldwin's wallet?

LOUIS
Huh?

HILDY
None of that innocent stuff, you 
double-crossing hyena! You stuck 
Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon 
on a phony charge that he swiped 
your watch, and you frisked his 
wallet! Now, give me that wallet or 
I'll stick you in jail and it won't 
be on any phony charge either! It'll 
be for life!

LOUIS
Now don't get excited, Hildy! I don't 
know what you're talking about -- 
but is this Mr. Baldwin's wallet?

He takes Bruce's wallet out.

HILDY
(grabbing it)
You know it is!

LOUIS
I didn't frisk him. He must have 
dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't 
know whose it was.

HILDY
No -- and you don't know that your 
cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin 
arrested again -- do you?

LOUIS
(surprised)
What -- already? Why, the dame left 
only a minute before I did!

He suddenly realizes what he's said and sprints for the door. 
Hildy chucks something at him. It just misses as he ducks 
out of the door.

MED. SHOT ANOTHER ANGLE

Hildy casts a savage look after the departed Louie, takes 
another look at the clock and grabs a phone and starts to 
dial.

HILDY
(into phone)
27th Precinct Station House?

Hildy stops short, arrested by a sound from the open window. 
She turns and sees Earl Williams, looking more inoffensive 
and exhausted than ever, indeed on the verge of collapse. He 
carries a large revolver. The search-lights that have been 
playing in the courtyard strike into the windows again.

WILLIAMS
(pointing gun at her)
Drop that phone --

Hildy drops the phone back on the hook.

WILLIAMS
(supporting himself 
by holding on to 
edge of desk)
You're not going to phone anybody 
where I am.

HILDY
(bracing herself)
Put down that gun, Earl.

He advances steadily toward Hildy, the gun aimed at her.

HILDY
You're not going to shoot me, Earl. 
I'm your friend, remember? I've got 
to write that story about your 
"Production for Use".

WILLIAMS
Yes -- that's right. Production for 
use.

Hildy starts walking toward him, slowly.

HILDY
Earl, you don't want to hurt your 
friends, do you?

WILLIAMS
Don't move!

Hildy stops.

WILLIAMS
Maybe you're my friend and maybe 
you're not -- but don't come any 
nearer. You can't trust anybody in 
this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I 
could shoot you from here.

HILDY
Sure you could, Earl -- but you 
wouldn't want to do that, would you? 
You wouldn't want to kill anybody.

WILLIAMS
No, no, you're right. I don't want 
to kill anybody. All I want to do is 
be let alone.

Hildy sneaks another step forward.

HILDY
Earl, there's just one thing I ought 
to clear up for the interview.

WILLIAMS
What's that? Only -- you're getting 
too near. I don't trust anybody.

HILDY
I don't blame you, Earl.
(another step forward)
If I were in your place I wouldn't 
trust anybody, either.

WILLIAMS
(suddenly)
Keep away!

He points the gun at Hildy, pulls the trigger and we hear a 
faint "click!"

WILLIAMS
(weakly)
I guess I used all the shells.

CLOSE TWO SHOT

He drops the gun and clutches at the edge of the desk for 
support. Hildy lurches forward and she grabs the other side 
of the desk for support. And at this moment she looks more 
tired than he does. She looks at Earl and breathes heavily.

HILDY
Earl, you must never do that again.

WILLIAMS
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go 
through another day like this.

HILDY
(more her old self 
now)
Well, maybe you think I could!

CAMERA FOLLOWS HER as she retrieves the gun and jams it in 
her purse, jumps to the windows, pulls down the shades.

EARL'S VOICE
I'm not afraid to die. I was tellin' 
the fella that when he handed me the 
gun.

Hildy crosses swiftly to the door, locks it and puts out the 
lights, so that they are visible only faintly in the light 
from the areaway.

HILDY
Don't talk too loud.

WILLIAMS
(babbling on as she 
moves about)
Wakin' me up in the middle of the 
night -- talkin' to me about things 
they don't understand. Callin' me a 
Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's 
got nothin' to do with bombs. It's 
the philosophy that guarantees every 
man freedom. You see that, don't 
you?

HILDY
Sure I do, Earl.

Hildy is looking around for a hiding place for him.

WILLIAMS
I wish they'd take me back and hang 
me. I done my best.

He abruptly crumples and falls to the floor. Hildy stands 
for a second, desperate. Then she picks him up and half 
carries, half drags him over toward a chair and places him 
in it. Then she makes a quick dash for her phone.

HILDY
(into phone)
Hello... Gimme Walter Burns -- quick!

Another phone there rings. Hildy answers it, propping the 
receiver of her own phone between ear and shoulder.

CLOSEUP HILDY AT PHONE

HILDY
(into second phone)
Hello -- hel -- Oh, hello, Bruce... 
Oh, Bruce, please -- I know I said 
I'd be down in fifteen minutes, but 
something terrific's happened! Hang 
on, Bruce --
(into first phone)
Walter?... Hildy. Come over here -- 
right away!... Wait!
(into second phone)
Bruce, just a second, Bruce -- I'll 
explain everything.
(into first phone)
Walter! Get this: I've got Earl 
Williams... Yes! Here in the Press 
Room... Honest! On the level. Hurry -- 
I need you.

She hangs up and turns into second phone.

HILDY
Bruce, this is the biggest thing 
that ever happened...
(lowers voice)
I just captured Earl Williams -- you 
know -- the murderer --

There is a knocking on the door, but she doesn't hear it.

HILDY
Bruce, I'll be down -- Well, Bruce, 
the minute I turn him over to the 
paper I'll be right down. Bruce, 
don't you -- Bruce, I can't now -- I 
can't, don't you realize?

There is a click from the phone. He has hung up. Hildy 
dejectedly hangs up the phone. There is the sound of knocking 
on the door. She springs up.

MED. SHOT

taking in door. Hildy glares apprehensively, then crosses to 
it.

HILDY
(cautiously)
Who's there?

MOLLIE'S VOICE
It's me, Mollie Malloy! Let me in.

Hildy carefully unlocks the door. Mollie bounds in like a 
wildcat and seizes her.

MOLLIE
Where are they gone? You know where 
they are?

HILDY
Wait a minute, Mollie.

She manages to relock the door, then turns, leaning against 
it, facing Mollie.

CLOSE SHOT HILDY AND MOLLIE

MOLLIE
They got him surrounded some place -- 
gonna shoot him like a dog!

HILDY
Mollie, they haven't got him. You 
gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to 
do something!

MOLLIE
What do you mean?

There is a sound -- a groan -- as Williams starts to come 
to.

MOLLIE
(spinning around)
What's that?

HILDY
Quiet, Mollie!

MOLLIE
There's somethin' funny going on 
around here.

MED. SHOT

Mollie crosses to wall and switches on the lights. She sees 
Williams, sobs and rushes over to him.

CLOSEUP EARL AND MOLLIE

Mollie gets down on her knees and begins ministering to Earl. 
He opens his eyes.

WILLIAMS
Hello, Mollie.

Mollie begins to sob.

WIDER ANGLE SHOT

Hildy comes over and says:

HILDY
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!

WILLIAMS
(putting out hand to 
stroke her hair)
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing 
to cry about.

HILDY
How'd you get here, Earl?

WILLIAMS
Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to 
shoot him. You believe me, don't 
you, Mollie?

MOLLIE
(coming up)
Of course I believe you.

WILLIAMS
I forgot to thank you for those roses. 
They were beautiful.

MOLLIE
That's all right, Mr. Williams...
(to Hildy)
You're a woman. You got to help us. 
You got to get him out of here, some 
place where I can take care of him.

HILDY
Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. 
I'm trying to think of something 
before those reporters get back.

WILLIAMS
Let 'em take me. It's better that 
way.

MOLLIE
No -- I'll never let 'em!

The door is tried outside.

MOLLIE
They'll get him! They'll get him!

HILDY
Ssh!

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE PRESS ROOM DOOR CLOSE SHOT

Endicott at door is trying to get in.

ENDICOTT
Who locked the door?

INT. PRESS ROOM BACK TO HILDY

HILDY
(calling)
Just a second, Mike ---
(whispering to Mollie)
Mollie, I got it!

MED. CLOSE SHOT AT DESK

Hildy jumps in to the desk and opens it, turning to cry in a 
tense whisper to Earl:

HILDY
Can you get in this desk?

INT. CORRIDOR CLOSE SHOT

Wilson is there too, now, and he and Endicott are pounding 
on the door.

WILSON
What's going on in there?

INT. PRESS ROOM HILDY, MOLLIE AND EARL

Mollie and Earl are with Hildy in front of desk now. They 
are speaking in whispers.

WILLIAMS
What good'll it do?

HILDY
We'll get you out in ten minutes.

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE DOOR

ENDICOTT
Open up there, will you!

INT. PRESS ROOM HILDY, MOLLIE AND EARL

HILDY
(crying)
All right -- all right!

MOLLIE
(to Earl)
Go on!
(shoving him to desk)
Please!

WILLIAMS
They'll find me anyhow.

There is further and louder pounding on the door. Earl gets 
in the desk. Hildy and Mollie pull the roll-top down over 
him.

HILDY
(calling)
I'm coming!
(to Earl)
Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.

MOLLIE
(to Earl)
I'll be right here. I won't leave 
you.

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE DOOR

ENDICOTT
(giving door a terrific 
kick)
Hey!

INT. PRESS ROOM CLOSE SHOT HILDY AND MOLLIE

HILDY
(to Mollie)
Mollie, drop down here! You've 
fainted!

MOLLIE
What's the idea?

HILDY
Never mind! Just play dead.

Hildy rapidly unbuttons Mollie's waist and throws it back. 
The kicking at the door continues.

MED. SHOT

Hildy rushes over to windows and pulls up the shades. Mollie 
is lying quietly on the floor with her eyes closed. Hildy 
rushes over to water cooler and gets a paper cup full of 
water. She throws the water in Mollie's face.

MOLLIE
(spluttering)
Hey --

HILDY
(fiercely)
Shut up, you!

Hildy crosses swiftly to the door.

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE DOOR

The door opens in Endicott's face and there is Miss Johnson, 
quite cool.

ENDICOTT
Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got 
calls to make, you know.

HILDY
Run down and get some smelling salts, 
will you?

WILSON
Smelling salts! What's going on here?

They catch sight of Mollie, stretched out on the floor.

ENDICOTT
Mollie Malloy -- what happened to 
her?

HILDY
(as Endicott and Wilson 
enter room)
Came up here -- had hysterics and 
passed out. I've been trying to get 
her to come to.

INT. PRESS ROOM MED. SHOT

Mollie is shaking her head.

ENDICOTT
She looks as though she's going to 
come to.

HILDY
Give me a hand with her, will you?

ENDICOTT
Okay.
(lifting Mollie)
Up you go, Mollie.

Hildy and Endicott lift Mollie and seat her in a chair. Wilson 
crosses to his phone.

CLOSE SHOT WILSON AT PHONE

WILSON
(into Phone)
City Desk.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

Taking in Hildy, Wilson and Mollie and Endicott.

ENDICOTT
She'll be all right.
(crosses to his phone)
The Desk.

WILSON
(into phone)
Well, they surrounded the house, all 
right, only they forgot to tell 
Williams, and he wasn't there.

MED. LONG SHOT TAKING IN DOOR

Murphy comes in.

MURPHY
(seeing Hildy, who 
has been fastening 
Mollie's blouse)
Hildy, I thought you were gone --

HILDY
Well -- I was going, but Mollie 
fainted away and I thought I ought 
to do what I could.

MURPHY
Some Hallowe'en goin' on outside. 
The whole police force standing on 
it's ear.

Murphy crosses to his phone. McCue comes in.

MCCUE
(panting)
What a chase!

ENDICOTT
(into phone)
No luck on Williams, yet -- call you 
back.

He hangs up.

WILSON
(into phone)
Okay, later.

He hangs up.

MURPHY
(into phone)
Murphy talking.

Schwartz comes in.

HILDY
Any news?

SCHWARTZ
Yeah. I was never so tired in my 
life.

He picks up his phone.

MCCUE
(into phone)
Where? Harrison Street Station? All 
right, connect me.

SCHWARTZ
(into phone)
Schwartz calling... Out with Hartman's 
deputies. I'm in a drugstore. You 
can't call me back because I'm going 
right on with them.

He hangs up -- puts his feet on the desk.

CLOSE SHOT HILDY AND MOLLIE

HILDY
Are you all right, now?

MOLLIE
Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.

MED. SHOT GROUP

MURPHY
Sure, Mollie, you never looked better 
in your life.

MCCUE
(turning from phone)
Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks 
good. An old lady just called the 
detective bureau and claims Williams 
is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've 
looked every other place. Want to go 
out on it?

ENDICOTT
Aw, nuts with chasing around any 
more. I spent a dollar-forty on taxis 
already.

SCHWARTZ
I say we don't go out any more. Let 
Earl Williams come to us.

CLOSEUP HILDY

HILDY
A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest 
story in two years and they're too 
lazy to go after it.

MED. SHOT GROUP

ENDICOTT
It's easy for you to talk. You're 
retired. We're still working.

MCCUE
Okay.
(into phone)
Forget it.
(he hangs up)

HILDY
What's the matter with you boys? 
Afraid it might rain? If you want to 
go, I'll cover this end.

MURPHY
Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound 
pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are 
you trying to scoop us or something?

ENDICOTT
Something smells around here. If you 
ask me Mollie gave her the story on 
how Williams got that gun.
(turning on Mollie)
Did you smuggle that gun into 
Williams, Mollie?

MOLLIE
I didn't do nothin'.

MCCUE
(crossing to Mollie)
Come clean, Mollie.

Wilson, Endicott and Murphy follow McCue toward Hildy.

ENDICOTT
Better let us in on it, Mollie.

HILDY
Aw, why don't you let her alone? 
She's ill!

MURPHY
Oh, you two are pals now -- I think 
you're right, Endicott. Mollie did 
give her some kind of story.

ENDICOTT
I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We 
better hold onto 'em both.

At this point Mrs. Baldwin appears in the doorway. Hildy 
gasps and starts for her.

MED. SHOT AT DOOR

Mrs. Baldwin is in a very righteous mood.

MRS. BALDWIN
Well?

CLOSE SHOT HILDY

as she comes in to her.

HILDY
Mother!

MRS. BALDWIN
Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and-
mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him 
looked up -- making us miss two trains -- 
and supposed to be married tomorrow!

HILDY
Mother, I can explain everything. 
I'll go with you in five minutes and --

MRS. BALDWIN
You don't have to go with me at all! 
Just give me my son's money and you 
can stay here forever as far as I'm 
concerned. Stay with that murderer 
you caught!

CLOSE SHOT REPORTERS

as they get this. Reactions as they glance at one another.

MRS. BALDWIN'S VOICE
(continuing)
Which one of these men is it? They 
all look like murderers to me!

MURPHY
Where does she get that stuff?

SCHWARTZ
Shall we tell her what she looks 
like?

ENDICOTT
Wait a minute! What murderer did you 
catch, Hildy?

MED. SHOT GROUP

The reporters are looking intently at Hildy and Mrs. Baldwin.

HILDY
I don't know what she's talking about. 
I never said any such thing.

MRS. BALDWIN
I'm quoting my son, and he has never 
lied to me.

The reporters move toward Hildy and Mrs. Baldwin speaking 
simultaneously.

REPORTERS
I knew something stunk around here -- 
Who says she caught him --? What do 
you mean she caught a murderer --? 
etc.

HILDY
(desperately)
But I never said anything like that!

MRS. BALDWIN
Yes, you did!

CLOSEUP MOLLIE

MOLLIE
She never told her that!

MED. CLOSE SHOT GROUP

HILDY
I said I was trying to catch one.
(to Mrs. Baldwin)
You got it balled up, Mother.

CLOSE SHOT

taking in Mollie, with Murphy coming into scene to her.

MURPHY
What do you know about it? How do 
you know she didn't?

He grabs her cruelly by an arm.

MOLLIE
Let go!

Endicott comes into scene.

ENDICOTT
Hold on to her, Jimmy -- she's in 
with Hildy on this.

CLOSE SHOT HILDY AND MRS. BALDWIN

Hildy tense with anxiety, her eyes on Mollie, off. Murphy 
comes viciously into scene to her and jerks Hildy by an arm.

MURPHY
Who you holding out on? Come clean, 
or we'll make you wish you had --

MED. SHOT

as the rest of the reporters surround Hildy menacingly.

ENDICOTT
(to Hildy)
Hildy, are you gonna cross us for 
Walter Burns after the way you told 
him off?

WILSON
Give in, Hildy -- you can't get away 
with it.

CLOSEUP MOLLIE

AS SHE CRIES WILDLY:

MOLLIE
Wait! You stool-pigeons! She don't 
know where Williams is. I'm the one 
that knows.

SHOT OF REPORTERS

as they turn on Mollie.

ENDICOTT
What do you mean, you know?

They start for Mollie.

MED. SHOT

Mollie begins backing slowly around the table, away from 
them, toward the window.

MOLLIE
Go find out, you heels! You don't 
think I'm gonna tell!

CLOSEUP HILDY

who has remained riveted at desk.

HILDY
Let her alone! She's goofy!

MOLLIE AND REPORTERS

Hemmed in by the massed reporters, she makes a sudden lunge 
for the door.

REPORTERS
Look out! Close that door! etc., 
etc.

They split, some of them heading her off at door, others 
from opposite side of table, so that she runs back between 
window and table.

MCCUE
You ain't gettin' out o' here!

ENDICOTT
Now, where is he?

WILSON
Where you hidin' him?

MOLLIE
I ain't gonna squeal! I ain't goin' 
to!

MURPHY
(leaning across table)
Come on, you! Before we slap you 
down.

ENDICOTT
Do you want us to call the cops and 
have them give you the boots?

MURPHY
Where is he, before we beat it out 
of you?

MOLLIE
(backing)
Don't you come near me, you kidney 
foot!

Murphy continues to advance on her. The reporters start for 
her from the other side. Mollie snatches up a chair and swings 
it at the advancing circle of men.

MOLLIE
(wild and blubbering)
Let me alone or I'll knock your heads 
off!

ENDICOTT
Put down that chair!

SCHWARTZ
Get around -- get on the side of 
her.

MOLLIE
(still backing)
No, you don't!
(a scream)
Keep away!

WILSON
Grab her!

With a last, wild look at her encircling foes.

MOLLIE
You'll never get it out of me!
(hurls chair at them)
I'll never tell! Never!

She makes a desperate leap for the open window and disappears 
out. Her scream of terror is heard as she drops. THEN RUSH 
FORWARD TO:

CLOSE SHOT AT WINDOW

as the reporters rush in and look out, an assortment of awed 
and astonished exclamations rising from them.

CLOSE SHOT MRS. BALDWIN

She turns away from the window and hides her face in her 
hands.

MRS. BALDWIN
Take me out of here! Take me --
(a moan)
Oh-h --

She collapses to a chair.

SHOT AT WINDOW

MCCUE
(turning)
Get the cops, somebody.

MURPHY
(turning)
Come on, fellas.

They start in a rush for the door.

MED. SHOT AT DOOR AND DESK

as the reporters rush out, and Hildy crosses, dazed to the 
window.

HILDY
Gee! The poor kid... the poor kid.

Reaching the window, she looks out.

EXT. PAVEMENT SHOOTING DOWN FROM HILDY'S ANGLE

The form of Mollie on the pavement below moves slightly in 
the moonlight, as guards rush into scene to her.

VOICES
(of guards rushing in)
Get a doctor! Take her to the 
infirmary! She ain't killed -- she's 
moving!

INT. PRESS ROOM SHOOTING INTO ROOM FROM WINDOW

Hildy turns, shaken, back into the room from the window and 
sees advancing to her across the room Walter Burns. Diamond 
Louie has entered with the Boss and stands leaning by the 
door. Mrs. Baldwin's face is still hidden by her hands. Hildy 
starts for Burns.

HILDY
Walter! D-did you see --
(gesturing back to 
window)
-- that?

CLOSE SHOT BURNS

BURNS
Yes. Where is he?

HILDY
(comes in to him)
She jumped out of the window.

BURNS
I know. Where is he, I said.

[MISSING PAGE]

CLOSE SHOT MRS. BALDWIN

looking up at them, off.

MRS. BALDWIN
What are you doing?

BURNS' VOICE
Shut up!

MRS. BALDWIN
I won't shut up! That girl killed 
herself. Oh-h, you're doing something 
wrong. What's in that desk?

CLOSE AT DESK - TAKING IN LOUIE AT THE DOOR

Burns slams closed the desk and steps to Louie.

CLOSE SHOT

BURNS
Louie, take this lady over to Polack 
Mike's and lock her up. See that she 
doesn't take to anyone on the way.

CLOSEUP MRS. BALDWIN

MRS. BALDWIN
What's that -- what's that?

CLOSE SHOT GROUP

as Louie comes in to Mrs. Baldwin.

HILDY
Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do 
that!

LOUIE
(extending his hand 
as if to shake hands 
with Mrs. Baldwin)
My name is Louis Peluso.

Unluckily for her she responds, only to find herself jerked 
to her feet and spun around so that one of Louie's arms is 
about her waist and the other hand over her mouth. Louie 
starts her to door.

BURNS
Tell 'em it's a case of delirium 
tremens.

TRUCKING SHOT

with them -- Hildy catching up.

HILDY
Now, let go of her, Louie. Listen, 
Walter, this'll get me in a terrible 
jam with my fiance and I don't stand 
so well with him now. Don't worry, 
Mother, this is only temporary.

At the door, Louie gets Mrs. Baldwin out and disappears with 
her. Hildy starts after them, when Burns' arm comes into 
scene, catching her.

CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND HILDY

BURNS
Where do you think you're going?

HILDY
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce 
out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you 
have to do this to me?

BURNS
(scornfully)
Get Bruce out of jail! How can you 
worry about a man who's resting 
comfortably in a quiet police station 
while this is going on? Hildy, this 
is war! You can't desert now!

HILDY
Oh, get off that trapeze!
(indicating desk, off)
There's your story! Smear it all 
over the front page -- Earl Williams 
caught by the Morning Post! And take 
all the credit -- I covered your 
story for you and I got myself in a 
fine mess doing it -- and now I'm 
getting out! I know I told you that 
twice before today -- but this time 
I mean it!

BURNS
You drooling idiot! What do you mean, 
you're getting out! There are three 
hundred and sixty-five days in the 
year one can get married -- but how 
many times have you got a murderer 
locked up in a desk? -- Once in a 
lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole 
city by the seat of the pants!

HILDY
I know, but --

BURNS
(interrupting)
You know! You've got the brain of a 
pancake! That wasn't just a story 
you covered -- it was a revolution! 
Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in 
journalism since Livingstone 
discovered Stanley for the New York 
Herald!
(quickly closes the 
door)

HILDY
(slightly bewildered)
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley 
who discovered Livingstone?

BURNS
Don't get technical at a time like 
this! Do you realize what you've 
done? You've taken a city that's 
been graft-ridden for forty years 
under the same old gang and with 
this yarn you're kicking 'em out and 
giving us a chance to have the same 
kind of government that New York's 
having under La Guardia! We'll make 
such monkeys out of these ward-heelers 
next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for 
them -- not even their wives!

HILDY
(the fire upon her)
I'd like to think.

BURNS
Well, think it then, because it's 
true! We'll crucify that mob. We're 
going to keep Williams under cover 
till morning so the Post can break 
the story exclusive. Then we'll let 
the Governor in on the capture -- 
share the glory with him.

HILDY
(excited)
I get it!

BURNS
You've kicked over the whole City 
Hall like an apple-cart. You've got 
the Mayor and Hartman backed against 
a wall. You've put one administration 
out and another in. This isn't a 
newspaper story -- it's a career! 
And you stand there belly-aching 
about whether you catch an eight 
o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! 
Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all 
you are.

HILDY
Let me get at that typewriter and 
I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg 
can write!

BURNS
Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming 
streets after you -- Hildy Johnson 
Street! There'll be statues of you 
in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be 
after you -- the movies!
(slapping his fist 
against his open 
palm)
By tomorrow morning I'll betcha 
there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can 
see the billboards now. Light up 
with Hildy Johnson!

HILDY
Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave 
Williams here. One of the other 
fellows'll --

BURNS
We're going to take him over to my 
private office.
(turning)
Where's our phone?

HILDY
That one -- how you gonna take him? 
They'll see him.

SHOT AT TABLE

as Burns gets phone and jiggles the hook.

BURNS
Not if he's inside the desk. We'll 
carry the desk over.
(into phone)
Give me Duffy!

HILDY
You can't take that desk out. It's 
crawling with cops outside.

BURNS
We'll lower it out of the window 
with pulleys. Quit stallin'.

As Hildy seems abstracted:

BURNS
Hildy!

HILDY
(coming to)
Huh!

BURNS
Get the lead out of your typewriter 
and start pounding out a load, will 
you? Snap into it!

HILDY
How much do you want on it?

BURNS
All the words you've got.

HILDY
(turning)
Where's some paper?

Goes out of scene.

BURNS
(into phone)
Hello...! Hello!

SHOT AT DESK

As Hildy comes in, going to desk, she turns to call back:

HILDY
Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- 
or is that libelous?

CLOSEUP BURNS AT PHONE

BURNS
Call him a love-child, if you want 
to.
(into phone)
Duffy!

CLOSE SHOT HILDY

Having opened the drawers of Bensinger's desk, she is tossing 
play manuscripts, syringes, patent medicines and old socks 
into the air, in a frantic search for paper.

HILDY
(calling to Burns)
How about the time he had his house 
painted by the Fire Department?

CLOSE SHOT BURNS

BURNS
Give him the works.
(into phone)
Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the 
biggest story in the world. Earl 
Williams caught by the Morning Post -- 
exclusive!

TWO SHOT HILDY AND BURNS

Hildy has unearthed a package of Bensinger's private 
stationary. She rises with it.

BURNS
(to Hildy)
Fine!
(into phone)
Now, listen, Duffy -- I want you to 
tear out the whole front page... 
That's what I said -- the whole front 
page! Never mind the European war! 
We've got something a whole lot bigger 
than that. Hildy Johnson's writing 
the lead and I'll phone it over to 
you as soon as she's finished.
(he starts to hang 
up, then thinks of 
something else)
Oh, Duffy! Get hold of Butch O'Connor 
and tell him I want him to come up 
here with half a dozen other wrestlers -- 
right away! Tell him we'll run his 
picture on the sport page for two 
weeks straight. What? I've got a 
desk I want moved. Never mind what 
desk!

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. STREET NIGHT MED. LONG SHOT

as the taxi darts through traffic, narrowly avoiding cars, 
trucks, etc., it comes almost head-on to an oncoming car.

INT. TAXICAB - NIGHT - PROCESS CLOSE SHOT

Louie, worried, ducks unconsciously. Mrs. Baldwin faints 
across his lap.

EXT. STREET MED. LONG SHOT

The taxi swerves just in time to duck the oncoming car. As 
it starts forward again a truck comes toward the cab, head 
on.

INT. TAXICAB - PROCESS CLOSE SHOT

Diamond Louie pushes Mrs. Baldwin into an upright position, 
takes a look through the windshield, sees the truck and gives 
a big "takem" and faints across Mrs. Baldwin.

EXT. STREET MED. SHOT

The truck and taxicab crash and the screen blacks out.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. PRESS ROOM - NIGHT CLOSE SHOT HILDY

at typewriter, smoke rising from her cigarette. As the CAMERA 
ANGLE WIDENS we see a fairly disheveled Hildy typing away 
furiously.

BURNS' VOICE
(Into phone)
"The Blackest cesspool in American 
city life!" Hold on Duffy, I'll see 
if she's got any more.

Burns comes into the scene, tears a page out of Hildy's 
typewriter. She inserts another one without noticing.

MED. SHOT

Burns goes back to the phone as Hildy continues to type 
furiously.

BURNS
(into phone)
Duffy -- Duffy!
(clicking the phone 
furiously)
Operator! Operator! Get me Duffy 
back. Somebody cut us off!

ANOTHER ANGLE FAVORING DOOR

as Bruce Baldwin enters.

BRUCE
Hildy!

BURNS
What the devil do you want? Listen, 
Bruce, you can't come in here now! 
We're busy!
(suddenly, into phone)
Where you been, Duffy? Stick around! 
What? What Chinese earthquake? The 
deuce with it... what's that?

CLOSE SHOT HILDY

typing away madly. Bruce comes into the scene.

BRUCE
Hildy!

HILDY
(looking up, very 
casually)
Hello, Bruce...

She resumes her typing, then suddenly realizes the situation 
and jumps up.

HILDY
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?

BRUCE
(the hands-off attitude)
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.

HILDY
Bruce, I know, but I was in the 
biggest jam --

BURNS' VOICE
Hildy!

MED. SHOT

As Hildy turns toward his voice, Burns, still with the phone 
in his hand, keeps talking to her.

BURNS
For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're 
waiting for the rest of that story!

HILDY
(resignedly)
Okay, Walter.
(sits down at her 
typewriter again)

CLOSE TWO SHOT BRUCE AND HILDY

Hildy begins typing again.

BRUCE
I waited and waited and then I had 
an idea and wired Albany to send me 
a hundred dollars so I could get out 
on bail...
(desperately)
I don't know what they'll think -- 
they sent it to the police station!

HILDY
(she barely stops 
typing)
We'll explain the whole thing to 
them.
(resumes typing)

BRUCE
I know I got you into this, Hildy, 
but it does seem to me that you can't 
care much for me if you're willing 
to let me stay locked up for two 
hours.

HILDY
Bruce, you know I'm mad about you 
and stop talking like that.
(calling o.s. to Walter)
Walter!

CLOSE SHOT BURNS

BURNS
(into phone)
Take the President's speech and run 
it on the funny page...
(turns to Hildy, o.s.)
What is it, Hildy?

HILDY'S VOICE
What was the name of the Mayor's 
first wife?

BURNS
You mean the one who drank so much? 
Tillie!

CLOSE SHOT HILDY AND BRUCE

HILDY
Thanks.
(she types furiously)

CLOSE SHOT THE DESK

Its top opens slowly and Williams' head sticks out.

CLOSEUP BURNS INCLUDING DESK IN B.G

BURNS
(screaming)
Get back in there, you mock turtle!

The desk-top falls, the fugitive disappearing within.

CLOSEUP BRUCE

turning around toward Burns.

BRUCE
Did you say anything, Mister Burns?

CLOSEUP BURNS

covering up, fast.

BURNS
No -- I was just talking to one of 
the guys at the office.
(indicating phone in 
his hand)

MED. CLOSE SHOT BRUCE AND HILDY

BRUCE
(to Burns)
Oh.
(turns to Hildy)
I wonder what's keeping mother? She 
was supposed to come down and get 
you.

HILDY
Oh, she was here.

BRUCE
Where'd she go?

HILDY
Out some place.

She types away. Bruce grabs her and stops her.

BRUCE
Hildy! Where's mother?

HILDY
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know 
where she went.

BRUCE
Did you give her the money?

HILDY
No, I was going to give it to her -- 
but she left hurriedly.

BRUCE
Then suppose you give me the money. 
Four hundred and fifty dollars.

HILDY
Oh, yes. Here it is.

She gets the wallet. Burns comes into the scene and pulls 
another page out of her machine.

HILDY
Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- 
three -- four hundred -- and fifty 
dollars.

BRUCE
(drily)
Thank you.

CLOSEUP BURNS

watching this with a grin.

MED. SHOT

Featuring the threesome.

BRUCE
(to Hildy)
And I'll take that certified check, 
too. I've decided I can handle things 
around here...

BURNS
Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep 
going! Sorry, Bruce, but --

HILDY
Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, 
here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, 
here's your wallet. I got it back.

BRUCE
(taking it and 
surveying it coldly)
You got it back, eh? There's something 
funny going on around here.

BURNS
Hildy!

HILDY
All right, Walter.

She sits down and begins to type.

BRUCE
I'm taking the nine o'clock train, 
Hildy. And you can meet us at the 
station.

HILDY
Fine.

She types away.

BURNS
(coming over to Bruce)
I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise 
you.

BRUCE
(dramatically)
If she's not there, mother and I are 
leaving anyhow!

But Hildy continues typing and doesn't even get it.

CAMERA TRUCKS WITH BURNS

as he leads Bruce away toward door.

BURNS
I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've 
got to forgive her. She's only a 
woman, after all.

BRUCE
Suppose she is -- I have feelings, 
too! Do you know where I've been for 
the last couple of hours? Locked up 
in a police station and she didn't 
move to do anything about it.

BURNS
Ts! Ts! Ts!

BRUCE
And now I don't know where my mother 
is. She may be lost.

BURNS
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to 
put every detective in the city on 
the job. Tell you what -- go over to 
the Missing Persons Bureau and 
describe your mother. What does she 
look like?

BRUCE
She's -- well, she's very motherly. 
That's about the best description I 
know.

BURNS
(nodding)
That's the kind of stuff they want!

They go out the door.

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE DOOR MED. CLOSE SHOT

Oh, Bruce, let me see that money 
Hildy gave you.

BRUCE
The money? Why?

BURNS
There's a lot of counterfeit big 
bills going around.

BRUCE
(worried)
Gee! Take a look, will you?

He hands the money to Burns. Burns looks at it carefully and 
hands it back.

BURNS
Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just 
wanted to be sure.

BRUCE
Say, I want to be sure, too!

INT. PRESS ROOM MED. SHOT

Hildy is typing furiously. Burns enters, grinning, locks the 
door behind him and goes to phone and picks it up.

BURNS
(into phone)
Duffy. Good. Stick close.

He turns and crosses quickly to look out the window.

AT WINDOW

Burns coming in to window.

BURNS
(despairingly)
Now the moon's out!

He turns away, crossing to the desk, the CAMERA TRUCKING 
with him. At the desk he taps three times, being answered by 
three taps from within.

BURNS
Fine. Three taps is me. Don't forget! 
You're sitting pretty, now. Got enough 
air?

He raises top an inch or two and fans air in to Williams.

BURNS
Is that better? Now breathe deep!

We hear an intake of breath from inside the desk.

BURNS
Attaboy!

He closes the desk and turns back to the table. As he passes 
Hildy, who is still typing rapidly:

BURNS
(looking over her 
shoulder)
That's the stuff! Lam it into 'em, 
Hildy.

He jerks the sheet from Hildy's machine, crosses to his desk 
and picks up the phone.

BURNS
(into phone)
Hello! Duffy, ready? Here we go!

CLOSEUP BURNS

reading from the page he has taken from Hildy's typewriter.

BURNS
(into phone)
"In the darkest hour of the city's 
history --"

INT. MAIN FLOOR CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING LONG SHOT

At the end of the hall are glass doors through which can be 
seen a turmoil of activity in the street outside -- newsboys, 
a crowd, and a mounted policeman or two. Bruce comes down 
the hall, his face set and angry. As he goes, he sees a sign 
set over a doorway in the hall. It reads: MISSING PERSONS 
BUREAU. He stops and enters.

INT. PRESS ROOM - NIGHT CLOSEUP BURNS AT PHONE

BURNS
(into phone)
Listen, did you impress it on Butch 
that I want him and his gang here 
right away? You did? Every minute 
counts. All right.
(puts receiver down 
on table)
Duffy's getting old!

CLOSE SHOT HILDY

HILDY
Where's Butch?

BURNS' VOICE
He's on the way.

HILDY
(over her typing)
He'd better hurry. The boys'll be 
coming back to phone.

BURNS
(coming into shot to 
peer over her shoulder)
Well, keep going! We want an extra 
out on the streets before it's too 
late!

HILDY
(looking up suddenly)
Where's Bruce?

BURNS
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to 
get the tickets.

HILDY
What tickets?

BURNS
Railroad tickets.

HILDY
Is he coming back here?

BURNS
Didn't you hear him? Of course he's 
coming back here. Keep going, will 
you?

MED. SHOT

as Burns leaves Hildy and goes over to desk and picks up his 
phone again.

BURNS
(into phone)
Duffy!

EXT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE DOOR - NIGHT CLOSE SHOT BENSINGER

Finding the door locked, he knocks.

INT. PRESS ROOM - NIGHT MED. CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND HILDY

as another knock comes, they take it big.

HILDY
(calling)
Who is it?

EXT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE DOOR - NIGHT CLOSE SHOT BENSINGER

BENSINGER
What's the idea of locking this?

INT. PRESS ROOM - NIGHT CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND HILDY

HILDY
That's Bensinger. That's his desk.

BURNS
(whispering)
What's his name?

The door knob is rattled violently.

HILDY
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.

EXT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE DOOR - NIGHT CLOSE SHOT BENSINGER

BENSINGER
Open this door!

INT. PRESS ROOM CLOSE SHOT BURNS

He starts for the door.

BURNS
I'll handle him.

CAMERA TRUCKS WITH HIM to the door.

BURNS
The Tribune, eh? Watch me!

He opens the door.

AT DOOR

BENSINGER
(as he comes in)
Ain't you got any more sense than to --
?
(sees Burns and is 
overcome)
Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite 
an honor having you come over here.

BURNS
(casually)
Hello, Bensinger.

BENSINGER
Excuse me, I just want to --

He starts for the desk. Hildy's typing goes on, coming in 
over the scene.

BURNS
(starting for the 
desk, suddenly 
blocking his path)
Quite a coincidence, my running into 
you tonight. Isn't it, Hildy?

HILDY'S VOICE
Yeh.

BENSINGER
How do you mean?

CLOSEUP BURNS AND BENSINGER

BURNS
I was having a little chat about you 
just this afternoon -- with our Mister 
Duffy.

BENSINGER
(essaying a pleasantry)
Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope.

BURNS
I should say not! That was one swell 
story you had in the paper this 
morning.

BENSINGER
(deeply moved)
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, 
Mr. Burns?

BURNS
(startled)
The poem?... The poem was great!

BENSINGER
(blinking at these 
words)
Remember the ending?
(and he recites)
" -- and all is well, outside his 
cell, But in his heart he hears the 
hangman Calling and the gallows 
falling And his white-haired mother's 
tears..."

BURNS
(overcome)
Heartbreaking! How would you like to 
work for me?

BENSINGER
What?

MEDIUM SHOT

taking in table, Hildy typing there.

BURNS
(to Bensinger)
We need somebody like you. All we've 
got now are a lot of low-brows. Like 
Johnson here.

He starts shoving Bensinger away from the desk, toward the 
table.

BENSINGER
Seriously, Mr. Burns?

Clinging to him, Burns takes him to the phone.

BURNS
(into phone)
Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to 
see you.
(looking up at 
Bensinger)
Mervyn, isn't it?

BENSINGER
No. Roy. Roy V.

BURNS
(with a little laugh 
at his own 
forgetfulness)
Of course!
(into phone)
Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course 
you wouldn't know! You probably never 
heard of Shakespeare, either! Put 
Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.
(to Bensinger)
How much are you getting on the 
Tribune, Roy?

BENSINGER
Seventy-five.

BURNS
I'll give you a hundred and a by-
line.

ANOTHER ANGLE

as Burns continues.

BURNS
(into phone)
Let him have everything he wants.
(puts down the 
receiver; turns to 
Bensinger)
Now hustle and write me a story from 
the point of view of the escaped 
man.
(acting it out)
He hides, cowering... Afraid of every 
light, of every sound... hears 
footsteps... his heart going like 
that... And all the time they're 
closing in... Get the sense of an 
animal at bay!

BENSINGER
Sort of a Jack London style?

TRUCKING SHOT

BURNS
Exactly!

Leads him hurriedly to the door.

BENSINGER
I got my rhyming dictionary in --
(indicating desk)

BURNS
(getting him to door)
It doesn't have to rhyme!

CLOSE SHOT - AT DOOR

as Bensinger turns there.

BENSINGER
Gee, I'm terribly grateful, Mister 
Burns. Do you suppose there might be 
an opening some time as foreign 
correspondent? I parley a little 
French, you know.

Burns shakes hands with him and opens the door with the other 
hand.

BURNS
I'll keep you in mind.

BENSINGER
(going)
Au revoir, mon capitaine.

BURNS
(never at a loss in 
any language)
Bon jour!

Continuing his French, he gets the door closed and relocked 
and turns for the table, singing as he does so:

BURNS
Mademoiselle from Armontieres, parlay --

MED. SHOT

Burns returns alertly to table, not noticing that Hildy has 
stopped typing, and sits staring moodily before her.

BURNS
(into phono)
Duffy! Got this!

CLOSEUP BURNS - AT PHONE

BURNS
A rat from the Tribune is coming 
over to get a job -- Bensinger, the 
guy I told you about. Handle him 
with kid gloves. Tell him to get 
busy writing poetry... No, we don't 
want him. Stall him along until the 
extra comes out. Then tell him his 
poetry stinks and kick him downstairs.

He lays down receiver.

WIDER ANGLE

taking in Hildy. She looks up at him.

HILDY
(to Burns)
Double-crossing swine!

BURNS
You said it! But this'll teach him a 
lesson. He won't quit his paper 
without giving notice after this.

Hildy doesn't bother to reply. She rests her chin on her 
hands and stares moodily ahead.

BURNS
Tear into it, will you? Don't sit 
there like a frozen robin!

HILDY
I'm finished.

BURNS
Finished!

He grabs the last sheet of paper out of her typewriter, kisses 
her and rushes over to the telephone.

CLOSEUP BURNS

at phone.

BURNS
(into phone)
Duffy! All right -- here we go! And 
got it out as soon as you can. I 
want this paper out on the streets 
in half an hour!
(reading Hildy's copy)
"So once more the Morning Post --"

EXT. CRIMINAL COURTS BLDG. - NIGHT MED. SHOT

Diamond Louie, bearing evidence of a mishap, his hat crushed, 
his face bruised and his clothes torn, comes running down 
the sidewalk and up the steps into the buildings.

INT. PRESS ROOM - NIGHT MED. SHOT

Hildy is up now, pacing.

HILDY
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, 
you're not trying anything again, 
are you?

BURNS
(coming over to her)
Hildy, you think I could? After this 
story?
(taking a flask from 
his pocket)
Here! You're just nervous.

Hildy takes the flask and takes a drink. There is a knock on 
the door. Burns takes the flask from her, restores it to his 
pocket and goes to the door.

BURNS
Who is it?

LOUIE'S VOICE
It's me, Boss -- Louie.

BURNS
(opening the door)
It's Louie!

Louie slips in and Burns relocks the door.

BURNS
(seeing Louie's 
disarray)
What's the matter?

Hildy crosses to Louie.

HILDY
(frantically)
Where's Mrs. Baldwin?

BURNS
What did you do with her?

HILDY
(almost afraid to 
speak)
What happened?

CLOSE SHOT - THE THREE

BURNS
You been in a fight?

LOUIE
(still out of breath)
Down Western Avenue. We were going 
sixty-five miles an hour. You know 
what I mean?

BURNS
Take that mush out of your mouth!

HILDY
Where's the old lady?

LOUIE
I'm telling you!

CLOSEUP - LOUIE

as he gets breath and blurts:

LOUIE
We run smack into a police patrol. 
You know what I mean? We broke it in 
half!

BACK TO GROUP

HILDY
(moaning)
Oh-h-h... was she hurt?

BURNS
Where is she? Tell me!

HILDY
Louie!

LOUIE
I'm telling you. Can you imagine 
bumping into a load of cops?! They 
come rollin' out like oranges!

HILDY
(seizing him)
What did you do with her?

LOUIE
Search me! When I come to I was 
running down Thirty-fifth Street.

HILDY
-- You were with her. You were in 
the cab, weren't you?

LOUIE
(exposing his bruised 
scalp)
Was I? The driver got knocked cold.

BURNS
Butter-fingers! I give you an old 
lady to take somewhere, and you hand 
her over to the cops!

LOUIE
What do you mean, I handed her? The 
patrol wagon was on the wrong side 
of the street.

BURNS
Now everything's fine. She's probably 
squawking her head off in some police 
station.

CLOSEUP - LOUIE

LOUIE
I don't think she's talking much... 
You know what I mean?

He winks reassuringly.

BACK TO GROUP

HILDY
(paralyzed)
Don't tell me -- was she killed?

BURNS
(hopefully)
Was she? Did you notice?

LOUIE
Say, me with a gun on my hip and a 
kidnapped old lady on my hands, I 
should stick around asking questions 
from a lot of cops! You know what I 
mean?

Hildy sinks into a chair.

CLOSE SHOT HILDY IN THE CHAIR

HILDY
Dead... dead! That's the end!

Burns comes into scene to her.

BURNS
It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will 
be.

HILDY
(wildly)
What am I going to say to Bruce? 
What'll I tell him?

BURNS
If he really loves you, you won't 
have to tell him anything.
(whacking her on the 
shoulder)
Snap out of it! Would you rather 
have had the old dame dragging the 
whole police force in here?

HILDY
I killed her. I'm responsible. Oh-
h... what can I do now? How can I 
ever face him? Oh, I hope he never 
comes back!

She buries her face in her hands.

BURNS
Look at me, Hildy --

HILDY
(springing up)
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!

BURNS
If it was my own mother, I'd carry 
on! You know I would. For the paper!

HILDY
(calling off to Louie)
Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going 
out!

MED. SHOT GROUP

The Post phone rings.

BURNS
(grabbing Hildy)
You stay here. I'll find out 
everything.

LOUIE

Western an' Thirty-fourth.

Hildy jumps for the outside phone on the desk.

TWO SHOT INCLUDING BURNS AT PHONE AND HILDY AT PHONE

BURNS
(into phone)
Hello -- hello...

HILDY
(into phone)
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.

BURNS
(guarded)
Who?
(wildly)
Hello, Butch! Where are you?

HILDY
(into phone)
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving 
Room.

BURNS
(into phone)
What are you doing there? Haven't 
you even started?

HILDY
(into phone)
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was 
there an old lady brought in from an 
auto smashup?

BURNS
(into phone)
Oh, for --
(yelling)
H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's 
a matter of life and death! Listen!

HILDY
(into phone)
Nobody?
(jiggles hook)
Morningside three-one-two-four.

BURNS
(into phone)
I can't hear... You got who? Speak 
up! A what?... You can't stop for a 
dame now!

HILDY
(into phone)
Is this the Community Hospital?

BURNS
(howling into phone)
I don't care if you've been after 
her for six years! Butch, our whole 
lives are at stake! Are you going to 
let a woman come between us after 
all we've been through?

HILDY
(into phone)
Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there 
an old lady --?

BURNS
(into phone, drowning 
out Hildy)
Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for 
you -- up to here!
(indicates up to where)
Now, you can't double-cross me!... 
She does? All right -- put her on. 
I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, 
Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent 
glamour girl, you can't keep Butch 
away from his duty... What's that? 
You say that again and I'll come 
over there and knock your eye out! 
Hello?
(turning, as he hangs 
up)
I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 
'em!
(into Post phone)
Duffy!
(to the universe)
Mousing around with some big blonde 
Annie on my time! That's co-operation!
(screaming into phone)
Duffy!!

HILDY
Shut up, will you?
(into phone)
You sure? Nobody?

BURNS
(into phone)
Duffy!!!!
(listening)
(into phone)
Duffy!!!!
(listening)
Well, where is Duffy?
(throwing receiver to 
desk)
Diabetes! I ought to know better 
than to hire anybody with a disease.
(turning)
Louie.

MED. SHOT GROUP

BURNS
(to Louie)
It's up to you.

LOUIE
(loyally)
Anything you want, Boss.

BURNS
Beat it out and get hold of some 
guys.

LOUIE
Who do you want?

BURNS
(starting for the 
door, followed by 
Louie)
Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 
'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer 
them anything -- only get them.
(confidentially)
We've got to get this desk out of 
here.

He unlocks the door.

LOUIE
You know me. The shirt off my back.

BURNS
You got plenty of money?

LOUIE
Sure, boss.

BURNS
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!

LOUIE
I always have both.

He goes out.

BURNS
(calling after him)
And don't bump into anything.

He relocks the door.

HILDY
Lafayette two-one-hundred.

BURNS
(turning from door)
That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I 
know it.
(bitterly)
Can you imagine Butch doing this to 
me -- at a time like this?

CLOSE SHOT HILDY AT PHONE, TAKING IN DESK

Burns steps into scene.

BURNS
(confidentially)
If Louie doesn't come back in five 
minutes we'll get it out alone. 
There's millions of ways. We can 
start a fire and get the firemen to 
carry it out in the confusion.

He crosses to the desk and inspects it.

HILDY
(into phone)
Ring that number, will you?

BURNS
(to Hildy, oblivious 
of her telephoning)
Come here. See if we can move it.

HILDY
(into phone)
Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- 
In Hospital? Did you have an auto 
accident in the last --

BURNS
(interrupting)
Will you come here?

HILDY
(into phone)
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.

BURNS
When I'm surrounded, with my back 
against the wall, you're not going 
to lay down on me, are you --

HILDY
Yes.

She jiggles the phone hook.

BURNS
(going to her)
Hildy, you just can't leave me out 
on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be 
cricket!

HILDY
I don't care what you say. I'm going 
to find Bruce's mother.
(she jiggles the hook 
madly)
Oh-h...
(she hangs up)
I'm going out and find her!

Grabbing her hat and purse, she starts for the door.

MED. SHOT OF HILDY, TAKING IN DOOR

There is a loud knocking on the door.

BURNS
(coming into scene 
after Hildy)
Don't open that!

HILDY
(at the door)
Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- 
to look --

She unlocks the door.

CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR

as Hildy flings the door open, only to find the Sheriff, 
accompanied by two deputies -- Carl and Frank -- and 
surrounded by McCue, Murphy, Schwartz, Wilson and Endicott.

MURPHY
There she is!

MCCUE
Say, Hildy...

Hildy makes a decision and tries to push through them, but 
the Sheriff grabs her and pushes her back.

HARTMAN
Just a minute, Johnson!

HILDY
Let go o' me. What's the idea?

MCCUE
What's your hurry?

MURPHY
We want to see you.

The deputies seize her.

HILDY
Take your paws off me!

HARTMAN
Hold her, boys!

Burns comes into scene.

BURNS
(to Sheriff)
Who do you think you are, breaking 
in here like this?

HARTMAN
You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't 
care who you are or what paper you're 
editor of.

HILDY
(struggling)
Let me go!
(hysterically)
Fellows, something's happened to my 
mother-in-law.

HARTMAN
Hang onto her! Keep her in here!

MED. SHOT

as Hildy breaks loose and retreats back into the room before 
Hartman and the deputies.

MCCUE
We know what you're up to.

ENDICOTT
Probably goin' out to get Williams.

SCHWARTZ
The door was locked.

WILSON
She and Mollie were talking.

HILDY
I don't know anything, I tell you. 
There's been an accident.

HARTMAN
Johnson, there's something very 
peculiar going on.

HILDY
You can send somebody with me if you 
don't believe me!

HARTMAN
I wasn't born yesterday. Now the 
boys tell me you and this Mollie 
Malloy --

HILDY
Nobody's trying to put anything over 
on you. I'm getting out of here and 
you can't stop me!

MURPHY
(comes into scene)
You're not going anywhere.
(to the Sheriff)
She's got the story sewed up, Pete.
(indicating Burns)
That's why Burns is here.

SCHWARTZ
We're on to you, Hildy. Let us in on 
it.

TWO SHOT - SHERIFF AND BURNS

BURNS
(purring)
If you've any accusations to make, 
Hartman, make them in the proper 
manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask 
you to get out.

HARTMAN
(pop-eyed; stammering)
You'll ask me to what?

BURNS
Get out!

HARTMAN
(to deputies, off)
Close that door. Don't let anybody 
in or out.

MED. SHOT - THE GROUP

MURPHY
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little 
third degree.

ENDICOTT
Make them talk and you got Williams, 
Pinky!

HARTMAN
Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of 
this. What do you know about Williams? 
Are you going to talk or aren't you?

HILDY
What do I know about Williams?

HARTMAN
All right, boys. Take her along. I 
got ways of making her talk.

The deputies seize Hildy. She struggles.

HILDY
Look out, you --

MCCUE
(nervously)
What's the use of fighting, Hildy?

Hildy manages to get in a few resounding smacks on the 
deputies' faces. The reporters swarm around the struggling 
trio. There are shouts of: "I got her!" "No, you don't!" 
"Aw, Hildy...", etc. In the struggle, Hildy suddenly drops 
her purse. It lands with a clank and comes open. A gun is 
revealed on the floor. Hildy picks it up.

DEPUTIES
Hey, she's got a gun! Look out, she's 
got a gun!

The deputies and reporters start to close in on her 
cautiously.

HILDY
(trying to face in 
all directions)
No, you don't! Walter!

BURNS
What is it? Here!

She tosses the gun to Walter, but one of the deputies 
intercepts the throw.

HARTMAN
Gimme that.

He takes the gun from the deputy.

CLOSER SHOT

The Sheriff stands frozen, staring at the gun.

HARTMAN
(to Hildy)
Where'd you get this?

HILDY
I've got a right to carry a gun if I 
want to.

HARTMAN
Not this gun!

Burns comes into scene.

BURNS
(easily)
I can explain that, Hartman. When 
Hildy told me she wanted to interview 
Earl Williams I thought it might be 
dangerous and I gave her a gun to 
defend herself.

HARTMAN
Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very 
interesting. This happens to be the 
gun that Earl Williams shot his way 
out with!

REPORTERS AD LIB
What? What's that? Etc...

BURNS
(advancing on Sheriff)
Are you trying to make me out a liar?

MURPHY
(bitterly at Hildy)
It's the last time I ever trust a 
woman, Hildy.

SCHWARTZ
Maybe Williams was gonna be her best 
man.

WILSON
That's pretty rotten, Hildy. Crossing 
your own pals.

HARTMAN
(shoving up to Hildy; 
trembling)
Where is Earl Williams? Where you 
got him?

BURNS
(sympathetically)
You're barking up the wrong tree, 
Hartman.

HARTMAN
I'll give you three minutes to tell 
me where he is.

HILDY
He went over to the hospital to call 
on Professor Egelhoffer.

HARTMAN
(outraged)
What?

HILDY
With a bag of marshmallows.

The Sheriff stands silent -- then hastily turns.

MED. SHOT GROUP AROUND HILDY

REPORTERS AD LIB
Come on, Hildy. Where is he?... This 
is a sweet trick, Hildy... I thought 
we were friends... Etc.
(to Sheriff)
Look here, Pete! What about Mister 
Burns?... Ask the Master Mind! What's 
he doing over here?

HARTMAN
(grabbing Burns' arm)
Speak up! What do you know about 
this.

BURNS
(gently but firmly 
disengaging his hand)
My dear Hartman!

He moves casually to a post before the desk and maintains 
it.

MURPHY
Can that! Where is he?

BURNS
(to Sheriff)
The Morning Post is not obstructing 
justice or hiding criminals. You 
ought to know that.

HARTMAN
No? Well --
(turning to Hildy)
Johnson, you're under arrest.
(turning to Burns)
You, too, Burns.

BURNS
(calmly)
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, 
square-toed spy -- do you realize 
what you're doing?

HARTMAN
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, 
you're guilty of obstructing justice 
and so is the Morning Post. I'm going 
to see that the Post is fined ten 
thousand dollars for this.

BURNS
You'll see nothing of the kind, 
Sheriff.

HARTMAN
We'll just start by impounding the 
Post property.
(pointing to 
Bensinger's desk, 
addressing Hildy)
Is that your desk?

HILDY
(jumping)
No!

BURNS
(almost simultaneously)
Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I 
dare him to move that desk out of 
here.

HARTMAN
Oh, you do, eh?
(to deputies)
All right, boys. Confiscate that 
desk.

Several of the deputies start toward the desk.

BURNS
(trying to intercept 
deputies)
Hartman, if you take this desk out 
of this building, I'll put you behind 
bars.

HARTMAN
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about 
that.
(to deputies)
All right, boys. Take it.

BURNS
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal 
offense.
(to deputy nearest 
him)
And you'll be an accessory!

HARTMAN
We'll take a chance on that, Burns.
(to deputies)
Go ahead, boys.
(the deputies continue 
toward the desk)

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE PRESS ROOM - NIGHT MED. SHOT

Flanked by two policemen, Mrs. Baldwin, dishevelled, with 
her hat over one ear, is marching toward the Press Room, 
bound for vengeance. Bruce, considerably upset, is with her. 
As they reach the door to the Press Room, Mrs. Baldwin stops.

MRS. BALDWIN
You wait outside, Bruce.

BRUCE
But, mother --

MRS. BALDWIN
(firmly)
No! You'll weaken when you see that 
little Jezebel! I'm going to tell 
her what I think of her!

She plumps her hat down more firmly on her head and marches 
into the Press Room followed by the two policemen. Bruce 
remains outside the door.

INT. PRESS ROOM

Taking in door as it opens and Mrs. Baldwin, followed by the 
policemen, comes in.

HILDY
(leaping forward)
Mother!

MRS. BALDWIN
(pointing out Burns 
to the officers)
That man there!

HILDY
(hugging Mrs. Baldwin)
Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you! 
Are you all right? Tell me.

Mrs. Baldwin indignantly shakes her off.

HARTMAN
What's the idea here?

POLICEMAN
This lady claims she was kidnapped.

HARTMAN
What?

MRS. BALDWIN
They dragged me all the way down the 
stairs --

HARTMAN
Just a minute. Did -- did --
(points to Burns)
-- this man have anything to do with 
it?

MRS. BALDWIN
He was the one in charge of 
everything! He told them to kidnap 
me!

BURNS
(amazed)
Are you referring to me, Madam?

MRS. BALDWIN
You know you did!

HARTMAN
What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, 
eh?

BURNS
(round-eyed)
Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never 
saw this woman before in my life!

MRS. BALDWIN
Oh, what a thing to say! I was 
standing right here - after the girl 
jumped out of the window.

HARTMAN
Did you get the Mayor?

DEPUTY
He's coming over.

BURNS
(to Mrs. Baldwin)
Now, Madam -- be honest. If you were 
out joy-riding, drunk, and got into 
some scrape, why don't you admit it, 
instead of accusing innocent people?

MRS. BALDWIN
(beginning to doubt 
her senses)
You ruffian! How dare you say a thing 
like that?

HILDA
Please, Mother, he's just crazy!

MRS. BALDWIN
(to Sheriff)
I'll tell you something more. I'll 
tell you why they did it!

BURNS
(fidgeting)
Come on, Sheriff. We've got to get 
bail.

MRS. BALDWIN
(continuing crescendo)
I was in here -- and they had some 
kind of murderer in with them. They 
were hiding him!

This is a bombshell. The room is electrified.

HARTMAN
Hiding him? In here?

Murphy, followed by the reporters, comes into scene.

MURPHY
Hiding him where?

HILDY
Mother!

REPORTERS
Where was he?... Where'd they have 
him?... Etc.

CLOSE SHOT BURNS

at the desk.

BURNS
(with superb 
indignation)
Madam, you're a cockeyed liar! And 
you know it!

To emphasize his righteousness, he pounds on the desk three 
times, forgetting that that is his signal to Williams. Then, 
realizing what he has done, he gasps.

MED. SHOT

Burns advances from desk, the others retreating before him.

BURNS
(anxiously)
Come on, Sheriff, we've got to get 
bail.

Three answering knocks come from the desk.

GROUP SHOT WITH DOORWAY IN B.G

They jump around to face the desk.

HARTMAN
(whispering)
What was that?

REPORTERS AD LIB
He's in the desk! -- For the love of -- 
He's in there! Etc.

HARTMAN
Aha! I thought so! Stand back, 
everybody!

DEPUTY
Look out, Sheriff. He may shoot!

HARTMAN
Get your guns out!

The policemen and deputies get out their guns.

HILDY
He's harmless.

HARTMAN
Don't take any chances. Shoot through 
the desk.

HILDY
He can't hurt anybody. You've got 
his gun.

MRS. BALDWIN
(panic-stricken)
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!

BURNS
You grey-haired old Judas!

MRS. BALDWIN
Let me out! Let me out of here!

She streaks for the door, flings it open and goes. The 
reporters tear out of scene to their telephones.

HARTMAN
(to policeman)
You stand there!

MURPHY'S VOICE
City Desk! Quick!

SCHWARTZ' VOICE
Gimme the Desk!

HARTMAN
(to another policeman)
You there!

ENDICOTT'S VOICE
City Desk! Hurry!

MCCUE'S VOICE
Gimme Emil...

HARTMAN
(to a Deputy, pointing 
with his gun toward 
the window)
You cover the window.

MURPHY'S VOICE
Look out where you're pointing that 
gun!

The Sheriff draws his men in around the desk, their guns 
drawn on it.

WILSON'S VOICE
Lemme have the Desk! Quick!

MURPHY'S VOICE
Hold the wire! I've got a flash for 
you!

BURNS
(to Hildy)
Call Duffy!

HARTMAN
No, you don't!

BURNS
(to Sheriff, furiously)
Do you want to get us scooped?

MCCUE'S VOICE
Emil? Hang on for a second.

HARTMAN
Now then, everybody aim at the center. 
And when I say three --

HILDY
That's murder!

HARTMAN
(changing his mind)
All right! Carl! Frank! One of you 
get on each side of the desk. Take 
hold of the cover.

They do.

HARTMAN
Now then! We got you covered, 
Williams. Don't try to move. Now! 
Everybody quiet and ready for an 
emergency. I'm going to count three.

SCHWARTZ
Hold it! Something coming up.

HARTMAN
One!

ENDICOTT
Hold the phone!

MURPHY
(into the phone)
I'll have it in a minute.

HARTMAN
Two!

WILSON
(into phone)
Right away now!

HARTMAN
(turning back to desk)
Everybody ready? All right. Now then, 
up with it.

Two deputies raise the cover. Williams is revealed, cowering 
in the desk, his hands over his face. The Sheriff rushes on 
him, jabbing his gun into him.

CLOSE SHOT SHERIFF AND WILLIAMS

HARTMAN
Got you, Williams!

WILLIAMS
(a wail)
Go on -- shoot me!

MEDIUM SHOT

as the police and deputies come in to assist the Sheriff. 
The reporters are telephoning in, the police shouting -- all 
the voices mixing in, in incredible confusion, as the Sheriff 
rushes Williams to the door and takes him out.

MURPHY'S VOICE
Earl Williams was just captured in 
the Press Room of the Criminal Courts 
Building, hiding in a desk.

OFFICERS AD LIB
(all talking at once)
Grab him! That's him! Don't let him 
shoot! Stick 'em up! -- Etc.

CLOSEUP MCCUE AT PHONE

CLOSEUP WILSON AT PHONE

WILSON

ENDICOTT'S VOICE
-- found Williams' hiding place.

SCHWARTZ' VOICE
He offered no resistance.

CLOSEUP MCCUE AT PHONE

MCCUE
(into phone)
Williams put up a desperate struggle 
but the police overpowered --

CLOSEUP MURPHY AT PHONE

MURPHY

of police --

ENDICOTT
(into phone)
Williams was unconscious when they 
opened the desk --

CLOSEUP BURNS

grabbing the Post phone.

BURNS
(into phone)
Duffy! The Morning Post just turned 
Earl Williams over to the Sheriff.

CLOSE SHOT THE SHERIFF

coming in the door with two policemen and leaping to get the 
phone away from Burns.

MED. SHOT BURNS AT PHONE, HILDY BESIDE HIM

BURNS
(into phone)
Duffy!

The Sheriff and police come into scene.

HARTMAN
(indicating Burns and 
Hildy)
Put the cuffs on those two!

The police handcuff Hildy and Burns.

ENDICOTT
An anonymous note received by the 
Sheriff led to Williams' capture. 
More later.

He hangs up.

CLOSEUP MURPHY AT PHONE

MURPHY
(into phone)
An old sweetheart of Williams' 
doublecrossed him. Call you back.

He hangs up.

MED. SHOT TAKING IN DOOR

REPORTERS
Where's that old lady? Hey, Madam! 
Where'd she go? Where's the old dame? 
Etc., etc. They run out after Mrs. 
Baldwin, the Mayor entering just 
after they go. Burns and Hildy, 
handcuffed together, stand near the 
Sheriff.

HARTMAN
(into phone)
Hello, girlie -- gimme Cooley. Quick!

BURNS
Hartwell, you're going to wish you'd 
never been born!

The Mayor comes into scene.

MAYOR
Fine work, Pete! You certainly 
delivered the goods. I'm proud of 
you.

HARTMAN
(holding the phone)
Look kind o' natural, don't they, 
Fred?

MAYOR
(happily)
A sight for sore eyes!

HARTMAN
(rolling in catnip)
Aiding an escaped criminal! And a 
little charge of kidnapping I'm 
looking into.
(into phone; suddenly)
But that's the jail! There must be 
somebody there!

MAYOR
Well! Looks like about ten years 
apiece for you birds!

BURNS
Does it? You forget the power that 
always watches over the Morning Post.

MAYOR
Your luck's not with you now!

HARTMAN
(into phone)
Cooley?... I caught Williams single-
handed -- we're going to proceed 
with the hanging per schedule!

He wiggles the hook for another call.

BURNS
(to Mayor)
You're going to be in office for 
exactly two days more and then we're 
pulling your nose out of the feed 
bag.

HARTMAN
(into phone)
Give me the District Attorney's 
office.
(to Burns)
I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- 
making brooms in the State 
penitentiary.
(into phone)
Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. 
Come over to my office, will you? 
I've just arrested a couple of 
important birds and I want to take 
their confessions.

He hangs up. Burns makes a sudden lunge for the Morning Post 
phone and cries into it.

BURNS
(into phone)
Duffy! Get Liebowitz!

MAYOR
All the lawyers in the world aren't 
going to help you!

BURNS
This is the Morning Post you're 
talking to!

MAYOR
(enjoying himself)
The power of the press, huh!

He laughs. Pinkus, the Governor's messenger, plentifully 
stewed, reels in the door. He approaches the Mayor and Sheriff 
who have their backs to him.

BURNS
(at the Mayor)
Bigger men than you have found out 
what the power of the press is... 
President!... Yes -- and Kings!

PINKUS
(woozy; handing Sheriff 
the reprieve over 
his shoulder)
Here's your reprieve.

The Mayor and Sheriff spin around.

MAYOR
(in a panic)
Get out of here!

PINKUS
You can't bribe me!

BURNS
What's this?

HARTMAN
Get out of here, you!

PINKUS
I won't. Here's your reprieve.

HILDY
What?

PINKUS
I don't want to be City Sealer. I 
don't like seals anyhow. They smell.

MAYOR
Who is this man?

HARTMAN
(to an officer)
Throw him out, Frank.

HILDY
(seizing Pinkus with 
her free hand)
Who was bribing you?

Burns also seizes Pinkus who is being pulled out of shape.

PINKUS
They wouldn't take it.

MAYOR
You're insane!

BURNS
(triumphant)
What did I tell you? An unseen power!
(to Pinkus)
What's your name?

PINKUS
Silas F. Pinkus.

MAYOR
You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The 
idea of coming here with a cock-and-
bull story like that!

HARTMAN
It's a frame-up! Some imposter!

HILDY
Wait a minute!
(to the officers)
Let go there!

BURNS
(to Sheriff and Mayor)
Murder, uh?

HILDY
Hanging an innocent man to win an 
election!

HARTMAN
That's a lie!!

MAYOR
I never saw him before!

BURNS
(to Pinkus)
When did you deliver this first?

HILDY
Who did you talk to?

PINKUS
They started right in bribing me!

HILDY
Who's 'they'?

PINKUS
(indicating the Mayor 
and Sheriff)
Them!

MAYOR
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. 
Burns! He's talking like a child.

BURNS
Out of the mouths of babes.

MAYOR
He's insane or drunk or something. 
Why, if this unfortunate man, 
Williams, has really been reprieved, 
I personally am tickled to death. 
Aren't you, Pete?

HILDY
Go on, you'd kill your mother to get 
elected!

MAYOR
That's a horrible thing to say, Miss 
Johnson, about anybody!
(to Burns)
Now, look here, Walter, you're an 
intelligent man --

BURNS
(interrupting)
Just a minute.
(to Pinkus)
All right, Mr. Pinkus. Let's have 
your story.

PINKUS
Well, I been married for ten years 
and --

BURNS
(interrupting)
Skip all that.

MAYOR
(loudly)
Take those handcuffs off our friends, 
Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.

HARTMAN
(springing to obey)
I was just going to!

He gets the key from the officer.

MAYOR
Walter, I can't tell you how badly I 
feel about this. There was no excuse 
for Hartwell to fly off the handle.

HARTMAN
(unlocking the 
handcuffs)
I was only doing my duty. Nothing 
personal in it.

They are set free.

HILDY
You guys better quit politics and 
take in washing.

MAYOR
(looking over the 
reprieve)
Sheriff, this document is authentic! 
Earl Williams has been reprieved, 
this Commonwealth has been spared 
the painful necessity of shedding 
blood.

BURNS
Save that for the Tribune.

MAYOR
(to Pinkus)
What did you say your name was -- 
Pinkus?

PINKUS
That's right.

He shows the Mayor a locket.

PINKUS
Here's the picture of my wife.

MAYOR
A very fine-looking women.

PINKUS
(mysteriously angered)
She's good enough for me! And if I 
was to go home and tell my wife --

MAYOR
I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, 
and as long as I am Mayor --

BURNS
Which ought to be about three hours 
more, I'd say.

HILDY
Just until we can get out a special 
edition asking for your impeachment.

BURNS
And your arrest. You'll each get 
about ten years, I think.

MAYOR
Don't make any hasty decisions, Mr. 
Burns, you might run into a thumping 
big libel suit.

HILDY
You're going to run into the Governor.

MAYOR
(trying to brush it 
off)
Now, my old friend the Governor and 
I understand each other perfectly.

HARTMAN
(eagerly)
And so do I!

MAYOR
(with superb contempt)
So do you what, you hoodoo!
(to Pinkus, suavely)
And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come 
with us, we'll take you over to the 
Warden's office and deliver this 
reprieve.

The Sheriff, Pinkus and the Mayor go out of scene.

BURNS
(dreamily)
Wait till those two future jailbirds 
read the Morning Post tomorrow.

Walter turns to Hildy and they suddenly smile at each other.

HILDY
How was that for a tight squeeze?

BURNS
Don't tell me you were worried!

HILDY
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't 
you?

BURNS
Uh-uh. As long as we were in there 
together pitching -- they couldn't 
lick us. Well, it's been a lot of 
fun.

HILDY
In a way.

BURNS
(laughs)
I mean -- working together. Just 
like the old days. The things we've 
been through, Hildy.

HILDY
We've certainly been in some swell 
jams.

BURNS
Remember the time we broke into the 
D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi 
Randell's diary?

HILDY
Yeah. What about the time we hid the 
missing heiress in the sauerkraut 
factory? Six scoop interviews!

BURNS
Yeah - but that time we stole Old 
Lady Haggerty's stomach off the 
Coroner's physician. We proved she 
was poisoned though, didn't we?

HILDY
(laughing)
We sure did, but we had to go in 
hiding for a week.

BURNS
In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only 
chaperon was the poor old lady's 
stomach.

HILDY
Don't remind me. That's how we 
happened to --

She breaks off. There is a moment's pause.

BURNS
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be 
making love to another man's fiancee.

HILDY
That's all right, Walter. It's as 
much my fault as yours.

BURNS
(glancing at the clock)
Bruce is making the nine o'clock 
train. I told him you'd be on it -- 
unless you want to write this story 
yourself.

HILDY
Well, if it's my last story, I'd 
like it to be a good one. But -- I 
guess I can't, Walter.

BURNS
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for 
me to decide. Of course, you could 
make a later train and still be in 
Albany tomorrow morning.

HILDY
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --

BURNS
He's going to have you the rest of 
his life, Hildy. Can't you give me 
another hour?

HILDY
I don't know what to do, Walter.

BURNS
Flip a coin.

HILDY
All right.
(takes coin from her 
bag)
Heads I go -- tails I stay to write 
the story. Ready?

CLOSEUP BURNS

gazing nervously at the hand holding the coin.

BURNS
Ready.

CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND HILDY

She flips and catches the coin. She holds it tightly clasped 
in her hand, afraid to look. They stare at each other a 
second.

BURNS
(nervously)
Well -- what is it?

HILDY
(almost breaking)
What's the difference? I'm going to 
write that story -- and you know it!

She puts the coin away without looking at it. Burns rushes 
to her, tries to take her in his arms.

BURNS
Hildy!

HILDY
(furiously)
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for 
you!

BURNS
(softly)
Then why are you doing it?

HILDY
Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven 
help me!

CAMERA DRAWS BACK to rest of story:

"Impeachment Proceedings Launched Against Mayor For Attempting 
to Conceal Governor's Reprieve!"

CAMERA DRAWS BACK FURTHER to the by-line --

By Hildegarde Johnson.

CAMERA DRAWS BACK STILL FURTHER to disclose Burns and Hildy 
looking at paper on Burns' desk.

BURNS
(enthusiastically)
The greatest yarn ever written by 
anybody. My hat's off to you, Hildy!

HILDY
(grimly)
Thanks.

BURNS
And what a way to quit. While you're 
still champion! That's the way to 
leave, Hildy!

HILDY
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, 
Walter.

BURNS
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting 
for you in Albany.

HILDY
No, he won't. I wired him that I 
wasn't coming.

CLOSEUP BURNS

BURNS
Where'd you wire him?

HILDY
On the nine o'clock train. That's 
the one he took, isn't it?

BURNS
Sure.

MED. SHOT

HILDY
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs 
a wife who can give him a home -- 
and affection -- and peace. I couldn't 
do that for him, Walter. I'm what 
you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd 
give up her soul for a story!... Is 
that job still open?

BURNS
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- 
and being Mrs. Walter Burns.

HILDY
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We 
tried it.

BURNS
Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! 
Only you expected it to be like other 
marriages. It can't be like other 
marriages -- we're different! We're 
a different world. Look at what we 
went through today. I wouldn't trade 
that for any honeymoon in the world. 
I bet you wouldn't, either.

HILDY
A fine honeymoon, with a murderer 
right in the boudoir! And that other 
honeymoon in a coal mine!

BURNS
That's what makes it romantic. Every 
other married couple goes away on a 
honeymoon and for two weeks the bride 
knows just where the groom is, and 
vice versa. But us -- you never know 
where I am and I'm not sure where 
you are. That's Romance!

HILDY
Well, maybe I'd like to know just 
once!

BURNS
Hildy, if that's what you want, all 
right. We'll even go to -- how about 
Niagara Falls?

HILDY
(jumping)
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't 
mean that?

BURNS
Sure I do. And I'll tell you something

HILDY
Walter!

BURNS
Sure, I can't last forever. I want a 
son I can train to take my place on 
this paper.

HILDY
What would you do if it was a 
daughter?

BURNS
Well, if she looked like you -- Say! 
My brains and your looks -- that 
mightn't be such a bad combination.

HILDY
What's the matter with my brains?

BURNS
What's the good of arguing about 
something that probably doesn't exist? 
Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. 
What do you say?

HILDY
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and 
think it over.

BURNS
I don't want to rush you. Take a 
couple of seconds.

Louie marches in with a judge, half-dressed. Louie has the 
judge in a tight grip.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

BURNS
Hello, Judge!

JUDGE
This is an outrage, Mr. Burns! Sending 
a gunman to kidnap me!

BURNS
Now, wait a minute, Judge. This isn't 
a kidnapping. You've got the legal 
power to perform a marriage ceremony, 
haven't you?

HILDY
What!

BURNS
Now don't argue, Hildy.
(to Judge)
How about it, Judge?

JUDGE
Yes, but --

BURNS
Then go ahead. Come on, Hildy.

HILDY
Nobody's going to rush me into 
anything!
(as Louie sticks a 
gun in her ribs)
You keep away from me!
(but she's scared)

LOUIE
All right, Judge.

You're not fooling anybody.

"Hildegarde Johnson, will you have 
this man as your wedded husband, to

I will -- if he will.

(to Burns)
Have you got a ring?

Burns starts searching his pockets, then, to Hildy:

BURNS
(he takes ring off)
How about Bruce's?

HILDY
Walter, you can't do that!

BURNS
Sure, I can. Look at the policy I 
gave him!

on Hildy's finger)
"With this ring I thee wed and with 
all my worldly goods I thee endow: 
And thereto I plight thee my troth."

it's going to be like.

It'll be Heaven!

Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought 
up another coal mine to send me down

SHOOTING DRAFT

1939



FADE IN ON:

AN ESTABLISHING SHOT OF PARIS IN THE MONTH OF APRIL

DISSOLVE TO:

THE LUXURIOUS LOBBY OF THE HOTEL CLARENCE

CAMERA MOVES to a CLOSE SHOT of the desk. In the background 
is a revolving door leading to the street. Through the 
revolving door comes a strangely dressed individual, obviously 
one who doesn't belong in such surroundings. It is Comrade 
Buljanoff, a member of the Russian Board of Trade. Despite 
the spring climate of Paris, he still wears his typical 
Russian clothes, consisting of a coat with a fur collar, a 
fur cap, and heavy boots.

Buljanoff glances around the lobby, obviously over-whelmed 
by its magnificence. The Manager, puzzled by Buljanoff's 
strange appearance, approaches him.

MANAGER
(politely)
Is there anything I can do for you, 
monsieur?

BULJANOFF
No, no.

He exits toward the street. The Manager returns to his 
customary duties, when suddenly a second Russian, similarly 
dressed, pushes his way through the door and gazes around. 
It is Comrade Iranoff.

The Manager, definitely mystified by now, approaches him.

MANAGER
Yes, monsieur?

IRANOFF
Just looking around.

Iranoff exits. Again the Manager returns to his duties, when 
suddenly he sees that a third man, dressed in the same 
fashion, has appeared in the revolving door. It is Comrade 
Kopalski.

Kopalski doesn't leave the revolving door at all but as it 
turns, drinks in the whole spectacle of the lobby. The Manager 
is by now dumfounded.

STREET IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL CLARENCE

A taxi stands at the curb. Buljanoff and Iranoff are waiting 
beside it, Iranoff holding a suitcase. Kopalski, returning 
from the hotel, joins the group.

KOPALSKI
Comrades, why should we lie to each 
other? It's wonderful.

IRANOFF
Let's be honest. Have we anything 
like it in Russia?

ALL THREE
(agreeing with him)
No, no, no.

IRANOFF
Can you imagine what the beds would 
be in a hotel like that?

KOPALSKI
They tell me when you ring once the 
valet comes in; when you ring twice 
you get the waiter; and do you know 
what happens when you ring three 
times? A maid comes in -- a French 
maid.

IRANOFF
(with a gleam in his 
eye)
Comrades, if we ring nine times... 
let's go in.

BULJANOFF
(stopping him)
Just a minute -- just a minute -- I 
have nothing against the idea but I 
still say let's go back to the Hotel 
Terminus. Moscow made our reservations 
there, we are on an official mission, 
and we have no right to change the 
orders of our superior.

IRANOFF
Where is your courage, Comrade 
Buljanoff?

KOPALSKI
Are you the Buljanoff who fought on 
the barricades? And now you are afraid 
to take a room with a bath?

BULJANOFF
(stepping back into 
the taxi)
I don't want to go to Siberia.

Iranoff and Kopalski follow him reluctantly.

IRANOFF
I don't want to go to the Hotel 
Terminus.

KOPALSKI
If Lenin were alive he would say, 
"Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in 
your life you're in Paris. Don't be 
a fool. Go in there and ring three 
times."

IRANOFF
He wouldn't say that. What he would 
say is "Buljanoff, you can't afford 
to live in a cheap hotel. Doesn't 
the prestige of the Bolsheviks mean 
anything to you? Do you want to live 
in a hotel where you press for the 
hot water and cold water comes and 
when you press for the cold water 
nothing comes out at all? Phooey, 
Buljanoff!"

BULJANOFF
(weakening)
I still say our place is with the 
common people, but who am I to 
contradict Lenin? Let's go in.

All three start to leave the taxi, as we

DISSOLVE TO:

LOBBY -- HOTEL CLARENCE -- AT THE DESK

Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski are approaching the Manager, 
their only suitcase carried by two of them.

KOPALSKI
Are you the manager?

MANAGER
(eyeing the three 
suspiciously)
Yes.

KOPALSKI
Pardon me for introducing Comrade 
Iranoff, member of the Russian Board 
of Trade.

MANAGER
(bowing with strained 
politeness)
Monsieur.

IRANOFF
This is Comrade Kopalski.

MANAGER
Monsieur.

BULJANOFF
I am Comrade Buljanoff.

MANAGER
Monsieur.

BULJANOFF
May I ask how much your rooms are?

MANAGER
(trying to get rid of 
them)
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates 
are rather high.

BULJANOFF
Why should you be afraid?

The other two nod their agreement. The Manager has noted the 
single suitcase.

MANAGER
(haughtily)
I might be able to accommodate you. 
Is there some more luggage?

IRANOFF
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here 
big enough to hold this?

MANAGER
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that 
size in our vault, but there is one 
suite with a private safe...

IRANOFF
That's even better.

MANAGER
But, gentlemen, I am afraid...

BULJANOFF
He's always afraid.

The other two exchange a look of agreement again.

MANAGER
(a little annoyed)
I just wanted to explain. The 
apartment may suit your convenience 
but I doubt that it will fit your 
convictions. It's the Royal Suite.

The mention of the Royal Suite startles the three.

BULJANOFF
Royal Suite!
(To the manager)
Just a minute.

The Three Russians take a step away from the manager and go 
into a huddle.

BULJANOFF
(in a low voice)
Now Comrades, I warn you... if it 
gets out in Moscow that we stay in 
the Royal Suite we will get into 
terrible trouble.

IRANOFF
(defending his right 
to a good time)
We'll just say we had to take it on 
account of the safe. That's a perfect 
excuse. There was no other safe big 
enough.

The other two welcome the suggestion with relish.

BULJANOFF AND IRANOFF
That's right. Good, very good.

Suddenly Buljanoff grows skeptical again.

BULJANOFF
Of course, we could take out the 
pieces and distribute them in three 
or four boxes in the vault and take 
a small room. That's an idea, isn't 
it?

For a moment all three see their bright plans crumble. Then 
Iranoff comes to the rescue.

IRANOFF
Yes, it's an idea, but who says we 
have to have an idea?

Buljanoff and Kopalski see the logic of this and their faces 
light up.

BOTH
That's right... that's right.

BULJANOFF
(turning to the Manager)
Give us the Royal Suite.

The Manager leads the three toward the elevator. The CAMERA 
FOLLOWS THEM and NARROWS DOWN to the suitcase carried by two 
of the Russians.

DISSOLVE TO:

DARK INTERIOR OF SAFE -- ROYAL SUITE

We hear from the outside the turning of a key, the opening 
of a door, then the turning of the dial, and then we see the 
safe door open. Through the open door we now see the Royal 
Suite. The Three Russians are standing in front of the safe. 
One of them puts the suitcase into it.

MEDIUM SHOT -- ROYAL SUITE OF THE HOTEL CLARENCE

Shooting from the interior of the room toward the safe. The 
Three Russians are standing around it. As Buljanoff and 
Iranoff close the safe door, Kopalski walks out of the shot. 
The CAMERA STAYS for a few seconds on Buljanoff and Iranoff, 
then PANS OVER to the center of the room, where a waiter is 
setting a breakfast table. He is the former Count Rakonin, a 
Russian exile employed by the Hotel Clarence. Rakonin is 
looking with great interest toward the safe, and as he does 
so we hear Kopalski's voice talking into the telephone.

KOPALSKI'S VOICE
Will you connect me with Mercier... 
yes, the jeweler...

Rakonin pricks up his ears and looks toward the telephone.

CLOSE SHOT -- KOPALSKI -- AT TELEPHONE

KOPALSKI
I want to speak with Monsieur Mercier 
personally... Hello, Monsieur Mercier? 
This is Kopalski of the Russian Board 
of Trade. We arrived this morning... 
Thank you.

CLOSE SHOT -- RAKONIN

As he sets the breakfast table, his interest in the telephone 
conversation increases.

KOPALSKI'S VOICE
Yes, everything is here. The necklace 
too. All fourteen pieces... What? 
No, Monsieur Mercier, the court jewels 
of the Duchess Swana consisted of 
fourteen pieces. Why don't you check 
on that? Naturally, we have all the 
necessary credentials.

As the voice continues, we

DISSOLVE TO:

SERVICE STAIRCASE -- HOTEL CLARENCE

Rakonin hurries down the stairs, buttoning his overcoat around 
him. He exits through a door to the street.

STREET CORNER NEAR THE HOTEL CLARENCE

WIPE TO:

Rakonin is getting into a taxi.

RAKONIN
(to taxi driver)
Eight Rue de Chalon.

WIPE TO:

INSERT the House Number "8"

above the doorway of a Parisian apartment house. Camera pulls 
back to medium shot of the whole entrance. Into it is striding 
a typical Parisian playboy. He is Count Leon d'Algout.

ENTRANCE HALL -- SWANA'S APARTMENT

The door is being opened by Swana's maid. Leon enters like a 
man thoroughly at home.

MAID
Good morning, Count.

LEON
Good morning.

MAID
Her Highness is still dressing.

LEON
(as he walks toward 
Swana's door)
That's all right.

LONG SHOT -- SWANA'S ROOM

Swana sits at her dressing table in a negligee. Leon enters 
with the easy air of an old friend. He kisses her lightly.

SWANA
Hello, Leon!

LEON
Good morning, Swana.

During Swana's long speech he sits down, not paying much 
attention to her patter, lights a cigarette, and glances 
through a magazine.

SWANA
It's really a wretched morning... 
wretched. I can't get myself right. 
I wanted to look mellow and I look 
brittle. My face doesn't compose 
well... all highlights... how can I 
dim myself down, Leon? Suggest 
something. I am so bored with this 
face. I wish I had someone else's 
face. Whose face would you have if 
you had your choice? Oh, well, I 
guess one gets the face one deserves.

LEON
Your conversation has one marvelous 
advantage, Swana. However many 
questions you ask you never expect 
an answer.

SWANA
Don't you find that restful?... Why 
didn't you come last night?

LEON
Darling, I was busy looking out for 
your interests.

SWANA
Did you win?

LEON
(enthusiastically)
We can forget horse racing, roulette, 
the stock market... our worries are 
over! You remember that platinum 
watch with the diamond numbers? You 
will be in a position to give it to 
me.

SWANA
(with humor)
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me.
(She kisses him)

LEON
We can be rich if you say the word. 
I had dinner with the Guizots last 
night.

SWANA
(contemptuously)
Those newspaper people?

LEON
You'd be surprised how many nice 
people dine with the Guizots.

SWANA
What a gruesome proof of the power 
of the press!

LEON
Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur 
Guizot the idea of publishing your 
memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. 
"The Life and Loves of the Grand 
Duchess Swana of Russia"!

SWANA
(protestingly)
Oh, Leon!

LEON
Sweetheart, we won't have to bother 
about our future if you are willing 
to raffle off your past!

SWANA
Was it for this that I refused to 
endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I 
could have made a little fortune by 
saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner 
was the only vacuum cleaner ever 
used by the Romanoffs... and now you 
want them to smear my life's secrets 
over the front page of a tabloid?

LEON
I understand how you feel, but there 
is a limit to everything, particularly 
pride and dignity. They are willing 
to pay any price! They have a 
circulation of two million!

SWANA
Imagine two million clerks and shop 
girls peeking into my life for a 
sou! Think of my lovely life being 
wrapped around cheese and blood 
sausages! I can see a big grease 
spot in the midst of my most intimate 
moments!

Leon knows on which note to play for Swana's benefit.

LEON
Well, I am the last person to persuade 
you, but don't do it blindly... if 
this is your decision, you must be 
prepared to face the consequences...
(With the expression 
of a man ready to 
give his all)
I will have to go to work.

Swana rises and goes over to Leon. His method has been highly 
successful.

SWANA
My little Volga boatman! Stop 
threatening! I don't deserve this.
(Embracing him)
Are you my little Volga boatman?

LEON
Now, Swana...

SWANA
First tell me, are you my little 
Volga boatman?

LEON
(anything to stop her)
Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.

SWANA
(walking back to the 
dressing table)
Well... two million readers... I 
know exactly what they want. Chapter 
One: "A Childhood behind Golden Bars. 
Lovely Little Princess Plays with 
Rasputin's Beard."

Leon sits down next to her, growing enthusiastic.

LEON
I've got one chapter Guizot thinks 
is terrific. "Caviar and Blood." 
Swana escapes over the ice!

SWANA
A couple of bloodhounds and we have 
Uncle Tom's Cabin.

LEON
(thinking of another 
idea)
Darling, this would be wonderful! 
Just once... weren't you attacked by 
a Bolshevik?

SWANA
(straining her memory)
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!

LEON
Too bad! Brings our price down ten 
thousand francs!

There is a knock on the door.

SWANA
Come in.

The Maid enters.

MAID
Count Rakonin asks the privilege of 
a few words, Your Highness.

LEON
Count Rakonin?

SWANA
He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor 
devil. You know him.

LEON
Oh, yes.

SWANA
Tell him I won't be able to see him 
for a half an hour.

MAID
The Count says if it could be as 
soon as possible. It is luncheon 
time and he is just between courses.

The Maid exits. Swana walks toward the door of the living 
room.

LIVING ROOM -- SWANA'S APARTMENT

A charming room, which manages to create a little of the 
atmosphere of Old Russia. Rakonin stands, his overcoat still 
buttoned about him, waiting nervously. Swana enters, leaving 
the door ajar. Rakonin approaches her with the respect he 
would have paid her at the Imperial Court.

RAKONIN
Your Highness.

SWANA
How do you do, my friend.

RAKONIN
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, 
but...

SWANA
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose 
your job?

RAKONIN
No, madame, something of the utmost 
importance... it concerns your jewels.

SWANA
My jewels?!

RAKONIN
I remember one birthday of His 
Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had 
the honor of being on guard at the 
summer palace... I still see you 
bending before His Majesty... You 
wore your diadem and a necklace... 
your face seemed to be lighted by 
the jewels.

SWANA
(puzzled)
Why do you bring this up after so 
many years?

RAKONIN
They are here!... Your jewels!... 
Here in Paris!

SWANA
Alexis! Do you know what you are 
saying?

RAKONIN
This morning three Soviet agents 
arrived. I overheard a telephone 
conversation with Mercier, the 
jeweler. Your Highness, they are 
going to sell them!

MEDIUM SHOT -- DOOR OF BEDROOM

From the door of the bedroom appears Leon, his face alert.

LEON
Did I hear something about jewels?

SWANA
Rakonin, bless him, has given me the 
most amazing news!

MEDIUM CLOSE -- SWANA AND RAKONIN

Swana goes to the telephone.

SWANA
(into phone)
Balzac 2769...
(to Leon)
My lawyer...

Leon steps to her side, highly interested.

RAKONIN
I am sorry... I have to leave.

SWANA
(to Rakonin)
Thank you so much, my friend. I will 
get in touch with you.

Count Rakonin leaves.

SWANA
(into phone)
This is the Duchess Swana... I want 
to speak to Monsieur Cornillon... 
it's very important... please get 
him right away... Hello, Monsieur 
Cornillon? The most incredible thing 
has happened! My jewels are here in 
Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are 
trying to sell them! Yes... yes... 
we must act immediately!... Call the 
police... Have them arrested!... 
Well, then, get an injunction!... 
But do something, Monsieur Cornillon!
(apparently the answer 
is some objection 
from Cornillon)
...But they are my jewels! There 
must be some way of getting them 
back!

LEON
(just as nervous as 
Swana)
What does he say?

SWANA
(to Leon)
Shhh!
(into phone)
...But how can there be a question?... 
Are you my lawyer or theirs?... All 
right, I'll let you know!

She hangs up, rises, the legal situation whirling around in 
her brain.

LEON
What did he say?

SWANA
(discouraged)
It looks pretty hopeless... there 
may be a chance... that's all... The 
French Government has recognized 
Soviet Russia and he doubts that 
they will risk a war for my poor 
sake. He might be able to make up 
some kind of a case but it would 
cost money, money, money!... That's 
all they are interested in -- those 
lawyers!

LEON
(taking her in his 
arms)
Darling, calm down. Why do you need 
a lawyer? Haven't you your little 
Volga boatman?

Swana looks up at him, hope dawning in her eyes, as we

INSERT OF THE JEWELS

DISSOLVE TO:

spread out on a table in the Royal Suite. Camera pulls back 
to a LONGER SHOT. We see Mercier, the jeweler, examining the 
jewels with an eyepiece screwed in his eye. Around him stand 
the Three Russians. Mercier, a middle-aged man of the greatest 
suavity and elegance, but a shrewd trader none the less, 
looks up.

MERCIER
Very good... superb... excellent... 
it would be foolish to belittle the 
quality of the merchandise but your 
terms are impossible. My counteroffer 
is the absolute maximum.

KOPALSKI
But, Monsieur Mercier...

MERCIER
(continuing)
Gentlemen, I'll let you in on a little 
secret... we are only undertaking 
this deal for the prestige involved, 
and, quite frankly, we are expecting 
to take a loss.

Iranoff draws Buljanoff aside and whispers in his ear.

IRANOFF
(whispering)
Capitalistic methods...

BULJANOFF
They accumulate millions by taking 
loss after loss.

The telephone rings.

BULJANOFF
(answering phone)
Hello... this is Buljanoff, Iranoff, 
and Kopalski... Who?... Count 
d'Algout?... No, no... it must be a 
mistake... we can't be disturbed.

MERCIER
(continuing)
I assure you no one else could meet 
the figure named by my syndicate... 
at least under the present economic 
conditions.

KOPALSKI
We can wait.

IRANOFF
(pompously)
Do we give the impression of people 
who are pressed for money?

MERCIER
Yes. Gentlemen... let's put our cards 
face down. Right now there is a 
Russian commission in New York trying 
to sell fifteen Rembrandts. There is 
another in London mortgaging the oil 
fields in Baku. You need money and 
you need it quickly. I think my offer 
is fair and does not even take 
advantage of your situation.

CLOSE-UP -- BULJANOFF, IRANOFF, AND KOPALSKI

KOPALSKI
(to Mercier)
Just a minute.

The Three Russians step to one side.

IRANOFF
(in a low voice)
He's cutting our throat...

BULJANOFF
But what can we do?... We have to 
accept.

KOPALSKI
Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give 
in so quickly. After all we have to 
uphold the prestige of Russia.

BULJANOFF
All right, let's uphold it for another 
ten minutes.

There is a knock at the door. Iranoff walks toward it, unlocks 
it, opens it a little. In the door appears Leon.

IRANOFF
We don't want to be disturbed.

LEON
My name is Count d'Algout. I 
telephoned.

IRANOFF
If you want to see us you must come 
later.

LEON
I just want a word with Monsieur 
Mercier.

IRANOFF
But you can't...

Leon pushes his way in. He approaches Monsieur Mercier. The 
Russians get between him and the jewels and during the 
following scene put them back into the safe.

LEON
Monsieur Mercier. May I introduce 
myself? I am Count Leon d'Algout. I 
think I had the pleasure of meeting 
you in your beautiful shop. I was 
admiring a platinum watch with diamond 
numbers.

MERCIER
Oh, yes, yes...

LEON
(glancing at the jewels)
Glorious, aren't they?

KOPALSKI
Now, monsieur, you have no right...

LEON
(very charmingly)
Just a moment.
(to Mercier)
I hope you haven't closed this deal, 
Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you 
into serious difficulties.

ALL THREE RUSSIANS
Who are you? What do you want? What 
is this?

LEON
These jewels are the property of the 
Duchess Swana of Russia, and were 
seized illegally by the Soviet 
Government. I am acting for Her 
Highness, the Duchess. Here is my 
power of attorney.

He hands it to Mercier, who reads it.

IRANOFF
(excitedly)
You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is 
all non-sense.

KOPALSKI
These may have been the jewels of 
the Duchess Swana, but, like all 
private property, they were 
confiscated by the State.

LEON
We'll leave the problem of their 
ownership to the French courts. 
Meanwhile I have filed a petition 
for an injunction to prohibit you 
from either selling or removing the 
jewels. Here is a copy.

The Russians take the copy of the injunction, read it 
flabbergasted. As they do so, Leon turns to Monsieur Mercier.

LEON
I thought it my duty to warn you. I 
would hate to see you get in any 
trouble, monsieur.

MERCIER
Thank you.
(he turns to the 
Russians)
Gentlemen, this introduces a new 
element into our negotiations. Until 
this claim is completely settled...

KOPALSKI
We can call our ambassador.

IRANOFF
I give you my word! They were 
confiscated legally!

MERCIER
Please try to understand my position. 
I am not with-drawing. My offer stands 
and as soon as you produce a clear 
title, approved by the French courts, 
the deal is settled. Until then, 
good day.

He bows and starts toward the door. Leon accompanies him, 
opening the door as though he were the host.

LEON
(intimately)
I hope you will forgive me, Monsieur 
Mercier.

MERCIER
(in a low voice)
On the contrary. I consider myself 
very lucky. Good day.

He bows.

LEON
(bowing)
Good day, monsieur.

Mercier leaves. Leon closes the door and turns back into the 
room to the three outraged Russians.

LEON
(jauntily)
Well, gentlemen... how about a little 
lunch?

IRANOFF
Get out of here!

LEON
Don't look so gloomy, gentlemen. All 
is not lost. You may have a chance.

KOPALSKI
(bursting forth)
We may have a chance.

LEON
Yes... a very slim one. I want to be 
fair. I don't deny that you might 
make out some kind of a case.

KOPALSKI
We haven't anything to discuss with 
you. We'll talk to a lawyer!

LEON
All right -- go ahead... you talk to 
the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge!

IRANOFF
That won't help you! You can't 
intimidate us!

KOPALSKI
Soviet Russia will put all its might 
behind this case.

BULJANOFF
You think because you represent the 
former Duchess...

LEON
The Duchess...

BULJANOFF
The former Duchess!

LEON
In any case, gentlemen, a charming, 
beautiful, exquisite woman. I warn 
you, if this case comes to trial it 
will be before a French court, and 
when the Duchess takes the stand...

IRANOFF
All right, go ahead, get her on the 
witness stand! What can she say?

LEON
But how will she look? The fashions 
this spring are very becoming to 
her. Gentlemen, the judge will be 
French, the jury will be French, 
everybody in that courtroom will be 
French. Have you ever seen a French 
court when a beautiful woman sits on 
the witness stand and lifts her skirt 
a little? You sit down and pull up 
your pants and where will it get 
you?

IRANOFF
I suppose you expect us to hand over 
the jewels?

LEON
Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, 
I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying 
to do is make things as difficult as 
possible.

BULJANOFF
Not that we are giving in one inch, 
but tell us... what is in your mind?

LEON
Well, gentlemen, how about my 
proposition?

IRANOFF
What proposition?

LEON
I just said let's have a little lunch.
(picking up the 
telephone)
Room service.

MEDIUM SHOT -- CORRIDOR OF THE HOTEL CLARENCE

DISSOLVE TO:

shooting toward door leading to the Royal Suite. Two waiters 
are wheeling in a table on which is a block of ice filled 
with caviar and a collection of the most delicious hors 
d'oeuvres. They enter the room. After the door is closed we 
hear from within loud SOUNDS of approval from Buljanoff, 
Iranoff, and Kopalski. The CAMERA STAYS on the door. After a 
few seconds a very good-looking cigarette girl enters the 
room and from within we HEAR even louder SOUNDS of approval. 
Next a waiter enters carrying champagne and another with 
glasses on a tray. As they are going into the room, the 
cigarette girl comes out and runs excitedly down the corridor. 
Camera pans with her away from the door as she starts down 
the staircase.

MEDIUM SHOT -- DOOR OF THE ROYAL SUITE

Some of the waiters come out, others go in, carrying further 
delicacies.

MEDIUM SHOT -- HEAD OF STAIRCASE

Up the staircase pants the cigarette girl, followed by two 
other cigarette girls. Camera pans with them as they rush 
toward the door of the Royal Suite and enter. From within we 
HEAR terrific greetings. The CAMERA REMAINS ON THE DOOR as 
we SLOWLY DISSOLVE INTO EVENING.

The electric lights are lit and a band of five Hungarian 
musicians enters carrying typical Hungarian instruments, 
including a cimbalom.

LONG SHOT -- ROYAL SUITE

The orchestra is playing; the Three Russians, very high by 
now, are dancing with the girls. One of them is wearing the 
cigarette tray of one of the girls. It is a harmless but 
loud and hilarious party. Apart from all the hullabaloo sits 
Leon at the desk, a telegraph blank before him.

LEON
Hey, Sascha! Serge! Misha!

The three come to him, all in the gayest, most agreeable 
mood.

KOPALSKI
Yes, Leon...

IRANOFF
(pawing him)
What is it, my boy?

LEON
About this telegram to Moscow. Why 
should you bother? I'll write it for 
you.

BULJANOFF
Leon... Leonitchka...
(he embraces Leon)
Why are you so good to us?
(he kisses Leon)

IRANOFF
(kissing Leon too)
Leon, my little boy.

KOPALSKI
(joining them)
Oh, Leon, you are so good.

LEON
(freeing himself as 
best he can)
What's the name of that Commissar on 
the Board of Trade?

IRANOFF
Razinin.

LEON
(writing)
Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow.

KOPALSKI
You wouldn't like Razinin.

BULJANOFF
He's a bad man. Sends people to 
Siberia!

IRANOFF
We don't like Razinin.

BULJANOFF
(again pawing Leon)
We like you, Leon -- don't we like 
Leon?

The others join him and kiss Leon.

IRANOFF AND KOPALSKI
Yes, we like Leon... little 
Leonitchka.

This brings on a new frenzy of Russian affection. Leon frees 
himself and rises.

LEON
How does this strike you? Commissar 
Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow. 
Unexpected situation here. Duchess 
Swana in Paris claims jewels, and 
has already brought injunction against 
sale or removal. After long and 
careful study we suggest in the 
interest of our beloved country a 
fifty-fifty settlement as best 
solution. Iranoff, Buljanoff, and 
Kopalski.

KOPALSKI
If we say that, Leon... we'll be 
sent to Siberia!

IRANOFF
And if we have to go to Siberia...

LEON
(still looking over 
the telegram)
I'll send you a muff.

BULJANOFF
Oh, why are you so good to us?

IRANOFF AND KOPALSKI
Yes, you are so good, Leon.

Again they overwhelm Leon with an avalanche of Russian 
affection. At this moment Rakonin enters with some new bottles 
of champagne. The Russians immediately leave Leon and direct 
their affection toward Rakonin, embracing and kissing him.

ALL THREE RUSSIANS
Comrade waiter, dear waiteritchka!... 
Why are you so good to us? You good 
waiter!

After Rakonin has turned over the champagne to the Russians, 
Leon takes him aside.

LEON
Take this telegram to the telegraph 
office at once!

RAKONIN
Yes, monsieur.

He leaves the room.

CLOSE SHOT -- DOOR LEADING TO CORRIDOR OF HOTEL CLARENCE

Rakonin comes out with the telegram. The CAMERA PANS with 
him as he hurries down the corridor, reading it. The CAMERA 
NARROWS DOWN on an insert of the telegram as we

DISSOLVE TO:

TELEGRAPH WIRES OVER A WIDE SWEEP OF COUNTRY

DISSOLVE TO:

TELEGRAPH WIRES OVER THE ROOFS OF MOSCOW

Pan down past the roof of an official building to a CLOSE 
SHOT of a window. Behind it stands Razinin, reading the 
telegram. He is a violent, militant Bolshevik.

The telegram fills him with rage. As he crumples it, and 
stares into space, his expression bodes ill for Buljanoff, 
Iranoff, and Kopalski.

FADE OUT:

MEDIUM SHOT -- UPPER CORRIDOR OF HOTEL CLARENCE

FADE IN:

shooting toward door of elevator. The elevator comes up and 
stops, the door opens, and the Three Russians step out. They 
are very smartly dressed and look like any urbane gentlemen 
coming from the races. Two of them have racing glasses. As 
they walk toward the Royal Suite, Lady Lavenham, an elderly 
English aristocrat, comes out of her room.

LADY LAVENHAM
Good afternoon, messieurs, mes 
Comrades.

ALL THREE RUSSIANS
Good afternoon, Lady Lavenham.

KOPALSKI
And how is Lord Lavenham?

BULJANOFF
...and little Lady Beatrice?

LADY LAVENHAM
Very well. Did fortune favor you at 
the races?

IRANOFF
Comme ci, comme ca.

LADY LAVENHAM
I understand... nothing to write 
home about.

BULJANOFF
(alarmed)
Who wants to write home about it?

LADY LAVENHAM
It's just a saying. How about joining 
us Saturday night for dinner? We're 
having a few friends.

KOPALSKI
Are we free, Buljanoff?

BULJANOFF
Possibly.

IRANOFF
We'll manage.

LADY LAVENHAM
Then let's say at nine.

BULJANOFF
Black tie or white tie?

LADY LAVENHAM
Oh, let's make it white.

BULJANOFF
Certainly!

LADY LAVENHAM
Au revoir.

ALL THREE RUSSIANS
Au revoir.

As they walk into the Royal Suite, Buljanoff tosses off an 
urbane comment.

BULJANOFF
Nice people.

ANTEROOM OF ROYAL SUITE

As the three enter, the telephone rings. Buljanoff and 
Kopalski go into the living room. Iranoff answers the 
telephone.

IRANOFF
(into telephone)
Yes, Leon...
(a little bit annoyed)
What is it, Leon?... You can't hurry 
such things... You must give Moscow 
a little time... There's nothing we 
can do about it... why don't you 
drop in later?... Au revoir...

He steps into the living room.

LIVING ROOM

As Iranoff enters Buljanoff rushes toward him.

BULJANOFF
Misha! Misha!

IRANOFF
What is it?

BULJANOFF
A telegram from Moscow! It must have 
been here all day!

KOPALSKI
(joining them and 
reading telegram)
Halt negotiations immediately. Envoy 
extraordinary arrives Thursday six 
ten with full power. Your authority 
cancelled herewith. Razinin.

IRANOFF
It is Thursday!

BULJANOFF
It's six o'clock already!

They rush into the bedroom.

KOPALSKI
I always said it would be Siberia!

DISSOLVE TO:

LOBBY -- HOTEL CLARENCE

Manager at desk. Iranoff, Buljanoff, and Kopalski rush from 
the direction of the elevator. Iranoff pauses at the desk. 
The others go on to the door and wait for him there.

IRANOFF
(to Manager)
A Special Envoy is coming from Moscow. 
He'll occupy the Royal Suite. Move 
our things to the smallest room you've 
got.

MANAGER
Yes, monsieur.

IRANOFF
Right away... instantly!

From the door Buljanoff and Kopalski call impatiently.

BULJANOFF AND KOPALSKI
Iranoff!

IRANOFF
I'm coming!

As he starts toward the door, we

DISSOLVE TO:

PLATFORM -- PARIS RAILROAD STATION

The train has already arrived as the Three Russians hurry 
down the platform. Neither do they know the name of the Envoy 
Extraordinary, nor his appearance, and they are searching 
the crowd for some clue.

IRANOFF
This is a fine thing. Maybe we've 
missed him already.

KOPALSKI
How can you find somebody without 
knowing what he looks like?

Iranoff points to a bearded man with a knapsack.

IRANOFF
That must be the one!

BULJANOFF
Yes, he looks like a comrade!

They follow the man, but just as they are ready to approach 
him he is greeted by a German Girl. Both raise their hands 
in the Nazi salute.

BEARDED MAN AND GIRL
Heil Hitler!

As the two embrace, the Three Russians stop in their tracks.

KOPALSKI
No, that's not him...

BULJANOFF
Positively not!

By now the platform is almost empty. As the Russians in the 
foreground look around helplessly, we see in the background 
a woman who obviously is also looking for someone. It is 
Ninotchka Yakushova, the Envoy Extraordinary. The Russians 
exchange troubled looks and go toward her. Ninotchka comes 
forward. As they meet she speaks.

NINOTCHKA
(to Iranoff)
I am looking for Michael Simonovitch 
Iranoff.

IRANOFF
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.

NINOTCHKA
I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, Envoy 
Extraordinary, acting under direct 
orders of Comrade Commissar Razinin. 
Present me to your colleagues.

They shake hands. Ninotchka's grip is strong as a man's.

IRANOFF
Comrade Buljanoff...

NINOTCHKA
Comrade.

IRANOFF
Comrade Kopalski...

NINOTCHKA
Comrade.

IRANOFF
What a charming idea for Moscow to 
surprise us with a lady comrade.

KOPALSKI
If we had known we would have greeted 
you with flowers.

NINOTCHKA
(sternly)
Don't make an issue of my womanhood. 
We are here for work... all of us. 
Let's not waste time. Shall we go?

The Russians are taken aback. As Ninotchka bends down to 
lift her two suitcases, Iranoff calls:

IRANOFF
Porter!

A Porter steps up to them.

PORTER
Here, please...

NINOTCHKA
What do you want?

PORTER
May I have your bags, madame?

NINOTCHKA
Why?

KOPALSKI
He is a porter. He wants to carry 
them.

NINOTCHKA
(to Porter)
Why?... Why should you carry other 
people's bags?

PORTER
Well... that's my business, madame.

NINOTCHKA
That's no business... that's a social 
injustice.

PORTER
That depends on the tip.

KOPALSKI
(trying to take 
Ninotchka's bags)
Allow me, Comrade.

NINOTCHKA
No, thank you.

Ninotchka takes both suitcases and walks away with the Three 
Russians, whose nervousness has increased with every word 
from the Envoy Extraordinary.

BULJANOFF
How are things in Moscow?

NINOTCHKA
Very good. The last mass trials were 
a great success. There are going to 
be fewer but better Russians.

The hearts of the Three Russians drop to their boots, as we

DISSOLVE TO:

LOBBY -- HOTEL CLARENCE

Ninotchka, followed by the Russians, comes through the lobby, 
observing every detail of these unfamiliar surroundings.

Suddenly she stops. In the showcase of a hat shop in the 
lobby is displayed a hat of the John-Frederic's type.

NINOTCHKA
What's that?

KOPALSKI
It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.

Ninotchka shakes her head.

NINOTCHKA
Tsk, tsk, tsk, how can such a 
civilization survive which permits 
women to put things like that on 
their heads. It won't be long now, 
Comrades.

She walks out of the shot toward the elevator, followed by 
the Three Russians, as we

DISSOLVE TO:

ROYAL SUITE

Ninotchka enters, followed by the Three Russians, who by now 
are frightened to death.

BULJANOFF
This is the apartment we have reserved 
for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope 
you like it.

NINOTCHKA
(glancing around the 
tremendous room)
Which part of the room is mine?

IRANOFF
You see... it is a little different 
here. They don't rent rooms in pieces. 
We had to take the whole suite.

Ninotchka begins to unpack her things and puts her typewriter 
on the desk.

NINOTCHKA
How much does this cost?

IRANOFF
Two thousand francs.

NINOTCHKA
A week?

IRANOFF
A day.

NINOTCHKA
Do you know how much a cow costs, 
Comrade Iranoff?

IRANOFF
A cow?

NINOTCHKA
Two thousand francs. If I stay here 
a week I will cost the Russian people 
seven cows.
(with an outburst of 
emotion)
Who am I to cost the Russian people 
seven cows?

BULJANOFF
We had to take it on account of the 
safe.

IRANOFF
For ourselves... we are much happier 
now since we moved to a little room 
next to the servants' quarters.

Ninotchka takes Lenin's picture from her bags.

NINOTCHKA
I am ashamed to put the picture of 
Lenin in a room like this.
(she puts the 
photograph on the 
desk)
Comrades, your telegram was received 
with great disfavor in Moscow.

KOPALSKI
We did our best, Comrade.

NINOTCHKA
I hope so for your sake.
(she sits at her desk 
and starts to type 
her report)
Let us examine the case. What does 
the lawyer say?

BULJANOFF
Which lawyer?

NINOTCHKA
You didn't get legal advice?

BULJANOFF
We didn't want to get mixed up with 
lawyers. They are very expensive 
here. If you just say hello to a 
lawyer... well, there goes another 
cow.

KOPALSKI
We dealt directly with the 
representative of the Grand Duchess. 
I am sure if we call him he will 
give you a very clear picture.

NINOTCHKA
I will not repeat your mistake. I 
will have no dealings with the Grand 
Duchess nor her representative.

Ninotchka continues to type. The Three Russians watch her 
nervously. Each click pounds on their consciences.

NINOTCHKA
(looking up)
Comrade Buljanoff...

BULJANOFF
Yes, Comrade?

NINOTCHKA
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or 
two f's?

BULJANOFF
(with fright in his 
voice)
With two f's, if you please.

Ninotchka goes on with her typing. Suddenly she looks up at 
Iranoff, who becomes self-conscious and fixes his tie. As he 
does so he sees that Ninotchka's glance is concentrated on 
the spats which he was wearing and in his hurry forgot to 
remove. He knows it is too late to do anything about it except 
to stand one foot behind the other, as Ninotchka types faster, 
the clicking of her keys twice as loud. Ninotchka picks up 
the telephone.

NINOTCHKA
(into phone)
Will you send me some cigarettes, 
please?
(suddenly getting up)
Comrades, I am not in a position to 
pass final judgment but at best you 
have been careless in your duty to 
the State.
(with utmost gravity)
You were entrusted with more than a 
mere sale of jewelry. Why are we 
peddling our precious possessions to 
the world at this time? Our next 
year's crop is in danger and you 
know it. Unless we can get foreign 
currency to buy tractors there will 
not be enough bread for our people. 
And you three comrades...

KOPALSKI
We did it with the best intentions...

NINOTCHKA
We cannot feed the Russian people on 
your intentions. Fifty per cent to a 
so-called Duchess!... Half of every 
loaf of bread to our enemy! Comrade 
Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy 
and get the address of the best lawyer 
in Paris.

KOPALSKI
Yes, Comrade.

NINOTCHKA
You, Comrade Iranoff, go to the Public 
Library and get me the section of 
the Civil Code on property.

BULJANOFF
Is there anything I can do, Comrade?

NINOTCHKA
You might get me an accurate map of 
Paris. I want to use my spare time 
to inspect the public utilities and 
make a study of all outstanding 
technical achievements in the city.

BULJANOFF
Yes, Comrade.

The buzzer rings.

NINOTCHKA
Come in.

The three Cigarette Girls enter.

CIGARETTE GIRLS
(gaily)
Hello! Hello! Cigarettes?

Ninotchka looks up astonished. Seeing her, the Cigarette 
Girls freeze. The Russians stand by quietly.

NINOTCHKA
(looking at the 
Russians)
Comrades, you seem to have been 
smoking a lot.

FADE OUT:

MEDIUM SHOT -- LOBBY -- HOTEL CLARENCE -- EVENING

FADE IN:

shooting past the desk toward the revolving door. The 
telephone rings and the Desk Clerk answers.

DESK CLERK
Desk... yes, Monsieur Kopalski...
(he writes down the 
message)
...you are expecting Count d'Algout... 
uh huh... but he is not to go to the 
Royal Suite under any circumstances. 
He should go to your new room, 985? 
Thank you, monsieur.
(he hangs up the 
receiver)

A few seconds later Ninotchka, naturally completely unaware 
of the telephone conversation, passes by. She carries a map 
in her hand.

DESK CLERK
Good evening, madame.

NINOTCHKA
Good evening. She exits out the door.

EXTERIOR, HOTEL CLARENCE

Ninotchka emerges, unfolds the map.

CLOSE-UP -- MAP OF PARIS

in the hands of Ninotchka. The CAMERA ZOOMS down to a CLOSE-
UP of the little drawing of the Hotel Clarence on the map. 
The CAMERA then PANS OVER from the Clarence toward the 
opposite side of the street, but before we reach the opposite 
side we see that in the center of the street is a little 
isle of safety. The CAMERA proceeds PANNING to the opposite 
side of the square and we

DISSOLVE TO:

The Real Location Corresponding to That Seen on the Map and 
seen from the same ANGLE. It is evening, and along the street 
comes Leon on his way to the hotel. The CAMERA PANS with him 
as he crosses the street. He reaches the isle of safety and 
there passes Ninotchka, who has come from the other side. 
They pass on the little isle without noticing each other. 
Suddenly we hear the whistle of a traffic policeman and both 
Ninotchka and Leon have to step back to the little isle.

CLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA AND LEON

on the little isle. Wanting some information Ninotchka turns 
to him -- completely impersonal.

NINOTCHKA
You, please.

LEON
Me?

NINOTCHKA
Yes. Could you give me some 
information?

LEON
Gladly.

NINOTCHKA
How long do we have to wait here?

LEON
Well -- until the policeman whistles 
again.

NINOTCHKA
At what intervals does he whistle?

LEON
What?

NINOTCHKA
How many minutes between the first 
and second whistle?

LEON
That's funny. It's interesting. I 
never gave it a thought before.

NINOTCHKA
Have you never been caught in a 
similar situation?

LEON
Have I? Do you know when I come to 
think about it it's staggering. If I 
add it all up I must have spent years 
waiting for signals. Imagine! An 
important part of my life wasted 
between whistles.

NINOTCHKA
In other words you don't know.

LEON
No.

NINOTCHKA
Thank you.

LEON
You're welcome.

Ninotchka gets out her map, starts to unfold it.

LEON
Can I help you?

NINOTCHKA
You might hold this for me.

LEON
Love to.

NINOTCHKA
(engrossed in her 
geography)
Correct me if I am wrong... We are 
facing north, aren't we?

LEON
(bewildered)
Facing north... I'd hate to commit 
myself without my compass... Pardon 
me... are you an explorer?

NINOTCHKA
No... I am looking for the Eiffel 
Tower.

LEON
Is that thing lost again?... Listen... 
if you are interested in a view...

NINOTCHKA
I am interested in the Eiffel Tower 
from a technical standpoint.

LEON
Technical... I couldn't help you 
from that angle. You see, a real 
Parisian only goes to the top of the 
tower in moments of despair to jump 
off.

NINOTCHKA
How long does it take a man to land?

LEON
Now, isn't that too bad! The last 
time I jumped I forgot to clock it!
(looks at map)
Let me see... Eiffel Tower... Your 
finger, please.

He takes her finger and points to the map with it.

NINOTCHKA
(skeptically)
Why do you need my finger?

LEON
Bad manners to point with your own... 
Here... the Eiffel Tower.

NINOTCHKA
And where are we?

LEON
(shifting her finger 
back to the hotel)
Here... here we are... here you are 
and here I am... feel it?

NINOTCHKA
I am interested only in the shortest 
distance between these two points. 
Must you flirt?

LEON
I don't have to but I find it natural.

NINOTCHKA
Suppress it.

LEON
I'll try.

Ninotchka starts to fold her map.

NINOTCHKA
For my own information would you 
call your approach toward me typical 
of the local morale?

LEON
Madame, it is that kind of approach 
which has made Paris what it is.

NINOTCHKA
You are very sure of yourself, aren't 
you?

LEON
Nothing has occurred recently to 
shake my confidence.

NINOTCHKA
I have heard of the arrogant male in 
capitalistic society. It is having a 
superior earning power that makes 
you like that.

LEON
A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... 
I have been fascinated by your Five-
Year Plan for the past fifteen years!

NINOTCHKA
Your type will soon be extinct.

She walks away from him coldly. Leon stares after her, 
fascinated.

ENTRANCE -- GROUND FLOOR OF THE EIFFEL TOWER

DISSOLVE TO:

Camera moves with Ninotchka as she enters. She approaches an 
Attendant.

NINOTCHKA
Please... can you tell me the exact 
width of the foundation on which the 
piers are resting?... and the depth?

ATTENDANT
You don't have to worry. The thing 
is safe.

NINOTCHKA
I am not afraid... I want to know...

Leon, who apparently has taken a taxi and prepared himself 
otherwise, enters the scene, reading from a book.

LEON
(reading)
The foundation is one hundred and 
forty-one yards square...
(he tips his hat and 
interjects)
I hope you'll forgive me but I thought 
you'd...

NINOTCHKA
(interrupting)
Go ahead.

The CAMERA goes with Ninotchka and Leon as they walk toward 
the steps.

LEON
(continuing)
Four massive piers of masonry are 
sunk to a depth of forty-six feet on 
the side of the Seine, and twenty-
nine and one-half feet on the other 
side. The girders of interlaced iron-
work which stay the structure have 
an inclination of fifty-four 
degrees...

NINOTCHKA
That's a strange angle.

LEON
Yes, very strange.

By now they have reached the staircase. They start up.

LEON
(continuing to read)
Ascending to the tower is a staircase 
consisting of eight hundred and twenty-
nine steps...
(this disclosure 
frightens Leon as he 
realizes the climb 
ahead of him. He 
reads on as they 
walk up)
...and an additional two hundred and 
fifty-four steps to the very top...
(now Leon stops but 
Ninotchka proceeds 
on out of the picture. 
Leon calls after her 
and reads from his 
book in a loud voice)
There is an elevator included in the 
price of admission!

Ninotchka continues to climb.

MEDIUM SHOT -- STAIRS (FROM LEON'S ANGLE)

Ninotchka, paying no attention to him, walks up the stairs, 
two at a time.

CLOSE SHOT -- LEON

He looks after Ninotchka, then makes up his mind and returns 
down the stairs.

GROUND FLOOR -- EIFFEL TOWER, shooting toward the elevator 
door. The elevator with several passengers is just about to 
leave when Leon hurries into it. The door closes and the 
elevator starts to ascend quickly.

DISSOLVE TO:

HIGHEST PLATFORM -- EIFFEL TOWER

The CAMERA ANGLE includes the elevator door and a beautiful 
background view of Paris. The elevator door opens and Leon 
emerges leisurely. He is just about to step to the top of 
the staircase, when suddenly, to his great amazement, he 
sees Ninotchka, who stands at the balustrade overlooking 
Paris. She has climbed the tower faster than he despite the 
elevator. Dumbfounded, Leon approaches her. Ninotchka turns, 
very matter-of-fact.

NINOTCHKA
You gave me some very valuable 
information. Thank you.

LEON
(looking at the 
dazzling view)
And thank you for getting me up here. 
I've never seen this before. 
Beautiful, isn't it?

NINOTCHKA
Yes, it is.

LEON
I'm glad I saw it before becoming 
extinct.

NINOTCHKA
Do not misunderstand me. I do not 
hold your frivolity against you.
(she looks him up and 
down)
As basic material you might not be 
bad, but you are the unfortunate 
product of a doomed culture. I feel 
sorry for you.

LEON
You must admit that this doomed old 
civilization sparkles... It glitters!

Night View of Paris with Its Lights Ablaze, as seen from the 
Eiffel Tower.

NINOTCHKA AND LEON

NINOTCHKA
I do not deny its beauty, but it is 
a waste of electricity.

LEON
What a city! There are the Grands 
Boulevards... blasted out of the 
heart of the old streets. The Arc de 
Triomphe... made to greet Napoleon's 
army. The Opera! And Montmartre... 
Montparnasse... La Bohme... and now 
I'll show you the greatest attraction!
(he steps to a 
telescope and, taking 
some money from his 
pocket, drops a coin 
in the slot)
It will cost me a franc but it is 
worth it.
(he adjusts the 
telescope)
The most wonderful spot in all Paris -- 
unique! Here, look....
(she looks in telescope)
What do you see?

NINOTCHKA
I see a house that looks like any 
other house. What's remarkable about 
it?

LEON
It's not the structure but the spirit 
which dwells within. There are three 
rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to 
hospitality.

NINOTCHKA
So that is your house?

LEON
Well, let's say I live in it. Such a 
pleasant place... all kinds of 
comfort, easy to reach, close to 
street car, bus, and subway...

NINOTCHKA
(straight from the 
shoulder)
Does that mean that you want me to 
go there?

LEON
(feeling that he has 
offended her)
Please don't misunderstand me...

NINOTCHKA
Then you don't want me to go there.

LEON
(in a pickle)
Now I didn't say that either... 
naturally nothing would please me 
more.

NINOTCHKA
(simply)
Then why don't we go?
(looking at him)
You might be an interesting subject 
of study.

LEON
I will do my best.

They walk toward the elevator as we

DISSOLVE TO:

INTERIOR, ENTRANCE HALL -- LEON'S APARTMENT

In the foreground stands a console on which is a telephone.

Gaston, Leon's elderly, dignified butler, is answering the 
phone.

GASTON
(into phone)
No... Count d'Algout is still out. 
Yes, as soon as he returns I'll tell 
him. Yes... I'll tell him Monsieur 
Buljanoff.

He puts down the receiver as Leon opens the door with his 
key. Ninotchka and Leon enter. Ninotchka, during the following 
scene, is studying every detail of the apartment with the 
eye of a technical expert.

LEON
Good evening, Gaston.

GASTON
Good evening, Monsieur.

NINOTCHKA
Is this what you call the "butler"?

LEON
Yes.

NINOTCHKA
(takes Gaston's hand)
Good evening, comrade.
(to Leon)
This man is horribly old. You should 
not make him work.

LEON
He takes good care of that.

NINOTCHKA
He looks sad. Do you whip him?

LEON
No, though the mere thought makes my 
mouth water.

NINOTCHKA
(to the completely 
flabbergasted Gaston)
The day will come when you will be 
free. Go to bed, little father. We 
want to be alone.

Leon opens the door to the living room. Ninotchka enters. 
Just as he is about to follow her, Gaston addresses him.

GASTON
(in a low voice)
Count d'Algout, there have been 
several telephone...

LEON
Go to bed.

INTERIOR, LIVING ROOM -- LEON'S APARTMENT

Leon enters the room. Closes the door. Ninotchka is examining 
the room.

LEON
Well, may I offer you a drink, or 
how about something to eat?

NINOTCHKA
Thank you. I've had all the calories 
necessary for today.

Leon feels a little uncertain as to how to approach this 
creature.

NINOTCHKA
What do we do now?

LEON
We take off our hat and coat.
(he takes her things)
We sit down -- we make ourselves 
comfortable. We adjust ourselves to 
the prospect of a most enjoyable 
evening. We look at each other. We 
smile.
(Ninotchka doesn't 
respond)
Well... we don't smile. How about 
some music?

NINOTCHKA
Is that customary?

LEON
It helps. It has ever since King 
David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. 
As I am not so fortunate as to have 
my harp at hand, I shall turn on the 
radio.

NINOTCHKA
(the observer)
I should say this room is eighteen 
by twenty-five.

LEON
Not too big and not too small. What 
I'd call the typical room of an 
average man. Or shall we say a little 
above average. Now if there are any 
special aspects you wish to study I 
have nothing to conceal. Just look 
around. That's my desk. Those are my 
books, and here am I. Where shall we 
begin?

NINOTCHKA
I will start with you.

LEON
That's great. I'm thirty-five years 
old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh 
a hundred and eighty-two pounds 
stripped.

NINOTCHKA
And what is your profession?

LEON
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind 
alert, keeping my landlord appeased. 
That's a full-time job.

NINOTCHKA
And what do you do for mankind?

LEON
For mankind not a thing -- for 
womankind the record is not quite so 
bleak.

NINOTCHKA
You are something we do not have in 
Russia.

LEON
Thank you. Thank you.

NINOTCHKA
That is why I believe in the future 
of my country.

LEON
I begin to believe in it myself since 
I've met you. I still don't know 
what to make of it. It confuses me, 
it frightens me a little, but it 
fascinates me, Ninotchka.

NINOTCHKA
You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni-
notchka.

LEON
Ni-notchka.

NINOTCHKA
That is correct.

LEON
Ninotchka, do you like me just a 
little bit?

NINOTCHKA
Your general appearance is not 
distasteful.

LEON
Thank you.

NINOTCHKA
Look at me. The whites of your eyes 
are clear. Your cornea is excellent.

LEON
Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- 
you're so expert on things -- can it 
be that I'm falling in love with 
you?

NINOTCHKA
You are bringing in wrong values. 
Love is a romantic designation for a 
most ordinary biological, or shall 
we say chemical, process. A lot of 
nonsense is talked and written about 
it.

LEON
Oh, I see. What do you use instead?

NINOTCHKA
I acknowledge the existence of a 
natural impulse common to all.

LEON
What can I possibly do to encourage 
such an impulse in you?

NINOTCHKA
You don't have to do a thing. 
Chemically we are already quite 
sympathetic.

LEON
(bewildered, and yet 
completely intrigued)
You're the most improbable creature 
I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, 
Ninotchka...

NINOTCHKA
You repeat yourself.

LEON
I'd like to say it a thousand times.

NINOTCHKA
Don't do it, please.

LEON
I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must 
forgive me if I appear a little old-
fashioned. After all, I'm just a 
poor bourgeois.

NINOTCHKA
It's never too late to change. I 
used to belong to the petty 
bourgeoisie myself. My father and 
mother wanted me to stay and work on 
the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.

LEON
(bewildered)
The bayonet? Did you really?

NINOTCHKA
I was wounded before Warsaw.

LEON
Wounded? How?

NINOTCHKA
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry 
Brigade. Would you like to see my 
wound?

LEON
(dumfounded)
I'd love to.
(she pulls the blouse 
off her shoulder and 
shows him her scar)
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

NINOTCHKA
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.

LEON
Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.

NINOTCHKA
(readjusting her blouse)
Don't pity me. Pity the Polish lancer. 
After all, I'm alive.

More and more puzzled and fascinated, Leon sits down close 
to her.

LEON
What kind of a girl are you, anyway?

NINOTCHKA
Just what you see. A tiny cog in the 
great wheel of evolution.

LEON
You're the most adorable cog I ever 
saw in my life. Ninotchka, Cogitska, 
let me confess something. Never did 
I dream I could feel like this toward 
a sergeant.

A clock strikes.

LEON
Do you hear that?

NINOTCHKA
It's twelve o'clock.

LEON
It's midnight. One half of Paris is 
making love to the other half. Look 
at the clock. One hand has met the 
other hand. They kiss. Isn't that 
wonderful?

NINOTCHKA
That's the way a clock works. There's 
nothing wonderful about it. You merely 
feel you must put yourself in a 
romantic mood to add to your 
exhilaration.

LEON
I can't possibly think of a better 
reason.

NINOTCHKA
It's false sentimentality.

LEON
(trying desperately 
to make her mood 
more romantic)
You analyze everything out of 
existence. You analyze me out of 
existence. I won't let you. Love is 
not so simple. Ninotchka, Ninotchka, 
why do doves bill and coo? Why do 
snails, coldest of all creatures, 
circle interminably around each other? 
Why do moths fly hundreds of miles 
to find their mates? Why do flowers 
open their petals? Oh, Ninotchka, 
Ninotchka, surely you feel some slight 
symptom of the divine passion... a 
general warmth in the palms of your 
hands... a strange heaviness in your 
limbs... a burning of the lips that 
is not thirst but a thousand times 
more tantalizing, more exalting, 
than thirst?

He pauses, waiting for the results of his speech.

NINOTCHKA
You are very talkative.

That is too much for Leon. He takes her into his arms and 
kisses her.

LEON
Was that talkative?

NINOTCHKA
No, that was restful. Again.

Leon kisses her again.

NINOTCHKA
Thank you.

LEON
Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My 
impossible, unromantic, statistical...

The telephone rings.

LEON
(continuing)
Glorious, analytical...

NINOTCHKA
The telephone is ringing.

LEON
Oh, let it ring.

NINOTCHKA
But one of your friends may be in 
need of you. You must answer.

Leon exits out of shot to answer telephone.

CLOSE SHOT -- AT DESK

Leon enters, sits down, takes the telephone.

LEON
(into phone)
Hello?... Yes... I'm sorry but I 
couldn't make it. I ran into a friend 
from the army... What?... The deal 
is off! Are you crazy, Buljanoff?...

CLOSE-UP -- NINOTCHKA

She is startled by the name.

LEON -- AT TELEPHONE

LEON
...A special envoy arrived... What?... 
That sounds better. I'll be glad to 
see her any time she wants... Oh, 
she doesn't want to see me? What do 
you know about that? Why?... Well, 
I'll get in touch with her myself. 
What's her name?...
(he takes a pencil 
and a piece of paper)
...What?... Yaku... How do you spell 
it?... Heavens! those Russian names!
(he starts to write 
it down)
...I... Oh, Y...

Camera pulls back and Ninotchka enters the shot. She takes 
pencil from Leon's hand, writes out the name, and leaves 
again. At first Leon is not aware of the full significance 
of her action. Then it dawns on him.

LEON
(continuing)
Yakushova... Ninotch...

At last the situation is entirely clear to him.

LEON
(into phone)
All right. Thank you.

He hangs up and stares at Ninotchka. She is putting on her 
jacket.

LEON
(camera panning with 
him as he walks over 
to her)
Ninotchka...

He takes her arm.

NINOTCHKA
I must go.

LEON
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special 
Envoy Yakushova...

NINOTCHKA
Let's forget that we ever met.

LEON
I have a better suggestion. Let's 
forget that the telephone ever rang. 
I never heard that you are 
Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my 
Ninotchka...

NINOTCHKA
(firmly)
I was sent here by my country to 
fight you.

LEON
All right, fight me, fight me as 
much as you want, but fight me 
tomorrow morning! There's nothing 
sweeter than sharing a secret with a 
bitter enemy.

NINOTCHKA
(uncompromisingly)
As a representative of Moscow...

LEON
Tonight let's not represent anybody 
but ourselves.

NINOTCHKA
It is out of the question. If you 
wish to approach me...

LEON
You know I want to...

NINOTCHKA
Then do it through my lawyer!

LEON
(desperate)
Ninotchka, you can't walk out like 
this... I'm crazy about you, and I 
thought I'd made an impression on 
you. You liked the white of my eye.

Ninotchka looks at him for a second, then pulls herself 
together.

NINOTCHKA
I must go.

She starts for the door.

LEON
But, Ninotchka, I held you in my 
arms. You kissed me!

NINOTCHKA
I kissed the Polish lancer too... 
before he died.

As she goes out, we

FADE OUT:

THE ENTRANCE HALL -- LEON'S APARTMENT

FADE IN:

(Note: We have to invent some brief scene to indicate that 
three days have gone by. From this we)

DISSOLVE TO:

The butler opens the door. Swana enters, her manner showing 
her complete familiarity with the place.

GASTON
Good morning, Your Highness.

SWANA
Good morning, Gaston.

GASTON
Count d'Algout is still asleep.

SWANA
(as she walks toward 
Leon's room)
That's all right.

LEON'S BEDROOM

The curtains are drawn. The night light is still on. Leon, a 
dressing gown over his pajamas, is sound asleep in a big arm 
chair. As Swana enters, she sees him with some alarm.

SWANA
Leon! What in heaven's name...!

LEON
Huh?

SWANA
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?

LEON
No.

SWANA
Don't tell me the bed has lost its 
best friend.

LEON
I just couldn't sleep. I got up and 
went back... and then got up again. 
These last few days... whew!

SWANA
Darling, you're taking my business 
affairs far too seriously. Much as 
I'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of 
their filthy money, I won't do it at 
the expense of your health. 
Particularly as we know we won't get 
much.
(tenderly)
You look so pale... pale but 
interesting.

There is a knock at the door.

SWANA
Come in.

Gaston enters with a breakfast tray.

GASTON
Your breakfast, monsieur.

LEON
I don't feel like any breakfast.

SWANA
Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds 
and make yourself agreeable to the 
Whites if you don't keep up your 
strength.

GASTON
Shall I draw your bath, sir?

LEON
Make it ice cold.

SWANA
Not in your condition.
(to Gaston)
Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and 
tender. And lay out his gray suit.
(to Leon)
Afterwards I'll drive you through 
the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.

GASTON
A blue shirt, perhaps?

SWANA
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a 
striped one, and brighten it with a 
great blaze of tie.

GASTON
Very well, Your Highness.

Gaston disappears into the bath-dressing room. Swana makes 
Leon sit down and seats herself beside him.

SWANA
Now... here we have two very handsome 
soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose 
hens mind what happens to their eggs? 
Probably not. They have such unfeeling 
eyes. We'll put in a great nugget of 
butter, plenty of pepper and salt... 
Darling, I haven't seen you for three 
livelong days... seventy-two hours!

LEON
(irritably)
Oh, please, Swana! I don't know 
whether I'm standing on my head or 
my heels. Here you are blaming me 
for neglecting you when I'm trying 
to concentrate on another woman and 
can't get near her.

SWANA
You haven't seen her yet?

LEON
No, and believe me I've tried 
everything! I must have telephoned 
her a hundred times. I've sent her 
telegrams, I've sent her flowers... 
I asked her to dinner... I offered 
her seats for the Opera...

SWANA
That proletarian! In the old days 
we'd have had her flogged.

LEON
That wouldn't have done any good. 
Not with her.
(forgetting himself)
She's the most incredible creature 
I've ever seen.

SWANA
You just told me you hadn't seen 
her.

LEON
Well... er... I caught a glimpse of 
her when she walked through the lobby.

SWANA
Imagine the carpets of a self-
respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by 
the boots of a muzhik! What does she 
look like?

LEON
You can't imagine.

SWANA
That bad?
(Leon nods)
Old or young?

LEON
Timeless. When she comes into a room 
you'd think that the Bolsheviks had 
taken over Paris. She wears her cheap 
miserable blouse as though it were 
the latest model by Schiaparelli. 
What a woman! What a woman! There is 
a Russian snowstorm in each of her 
eyes.

SWANA
You saw all that in one glimpse?

LEON
(getting up)
Darling, if we're going to get 
anywhere someone has to keep his 
eyes open!
(he walks over to the 
bathroom)

SWANA
Now, darling, soak in your beautiful 
pine bath and let Gaston shave you.

Leon exits into the bathroom. As he does so a bell rings.

SWANA
Gaston!

There is no answer. After a slight pause she herself goes to 
answer the bell.

DISSOLVE TO:

MEDIUM SHOT -- ENTRANCE HALL -- LEON'S APARTMENT, shooting 
toward the door.

Swana goes to the door and opens it. The Three Russians stand 
outside. Seeing Swana, they are a little intimidated.

THE THREE RUSSIANS
How do you do?

Swana suspects that for the first time she is being confronted 
by representatives of the Soviet government.

SWANA
Yes?

KOPALSKI
We want to talk to Count d'Algout. 
My name is Kopalski.

SWANA
Oh... you are the three gentlemen 
from Moscow?

KOPALSKI
Yes.

SWANA
(icily)
You may wait.

She closes the door.

STAIRCASE HALL -- IN FRONT OF LEON'S DOOR

The Three Russians, very impressed, stand looking at the 
door which has just been closed.

BULJANOFF
That's her.

KOPALSKI
Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening 
the door for us.

BULJANOFF
Once in Petersburg I was driving 
down the Nevsky Prospect in my cart 
and Her Highness in her troika swept 
down from the opposite direction, 
and when I couldn't make way quick 
enough she spat in my face.

IRANOFF
Now look here, Buljanoff. You never 
were in Petersburg, you never owned 
a cart, and she never spat in your 
face. Who are you trying to impress?

At this moment the door is opened by Leon in his bathrobe.

LEON
Hello, boys.

ALL THREE RUSSIANS
Leon!

LEON
Come in, come in.

They enter.

LIVING ROOM -- LEON'S APARTMENT

Leon and the Three Russians enter.

LEON
What's new?

KOPALSKI
(excitedly)
Leon, Leonitchka, she is not going 
to negotiate! She is going to fight 
that injunction. She's going to make 
a precedent of it!

IRANOFF
She says she won't be intimidated by 
parasites. She called the Duchess a 
blood-sucking aristocrat and a 
blackmailer.

LEON
(eagerly)
What did she say about me?

IRANOFF
(after a moment's 
consideration)
I think she covered you with the 
parasites.

Leon is disappointed.

BULJANOFF
And Leonitchka! What she said about 
us...!

IRANOFF
And they might believe her in Moscow.

BULJANOFF
What do you mean they might -- they 
will!

KOPALSKI
We don't blame you, Leon, but when 
we came from Russia we believed in 
simplicity...

IRANOFF
We avoided luxury and extravagance 
and today... well, if you were to 
offer us a glass of champagne, we 
wouldn't say no.

Leon is so engrossed in his thoughts that he overlooks the 
hint.

LEON
Well, boys, I'd like to help you but 
what can I do? Yesterday I waited 
six hours in the lobby!

KOPALSKI
She doesn't leave her room! She has 
been locked in for the last two days 
with lawyers and law books!

LEON
All right, then make an appointment 
with her so I can see her!

KOPALSKI
We can't... but you are so ingenious, 
Leon...

IRANOFF
You found your way to us and we 
weren't easy to reach, were we?

LEON
No, no.

BULJANOFF
Didn't we put up a strong resistance?

LEON
Oh, yes, yes.

KOPALSKI
You must help us, Leon... if you 
don't win her over we're on our way 
to Siberia!

BULJANOFF
Or it might be the firing squad!

KOPALSKI
Or we can't go back to Russia!

An idea dawns on Iranoff.

IRANOFF
What's wrong with that?

Kopalski and Buljanoff seize on the same idea.

BULJANOFF
Yes! We could stay with Leon!

IRANOFF
Leon, how would you like to have 
three lifelong friends?

LEON
Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is 
your mother country. Three sons 
walking out all at once... that's 
too much for any mother.

BULJANOFF
Well, if your mother turns against 
you, you have to look for someone to 
adopt you.

Swana's voice comes from the next room.

SWANA
Leon! Just a minute...

Leon goes back to the other room.

LEON'S BEDROOM -- CLOSE SHOT, shooting toward the door of 
the living room.

Swana stands putting on her gloves.

SWANA
I'm leaving, dear. I'm lunching at 
Fouquet's if you can make it, and... 
Leon, remember, a man should think 
it over twice before he decides to 
become a mother.

She kisses him lightly and walks out.

LIVING ROOM -- ROYAL SUITE -- MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- AT THE 
DESK

It is piled deep with law books and papers. Ninotchka sits 
at it, conferring with two Lawyers.

FIRST LAWYER
(uncertainly)
I seem to remember some additional 
injunctive provision dealing with 
the property of foreigners residing 
in France.

NINOTCHKA
(with the precision 
of a machine)
You are referring to paragraph 59b, 
section 25f of the Civil Code.

The Lawyers exchange a glance of surprise at her knowledge. 
One of them takes up one of the law books and as he starts 
to look up the case, Ninotchka speaks.

NINOTCHKA
Page eight hundred twenty-four.

Again the Lawyers exchange a glance of astonishment.

NINOTCHKA
And do not fail to read the three 
footnotes. While you are studying it 
I will eat.
(She picks up the 
telephone)
Food please.

A LITTLE CORNER IN THE ROOM SERVICE PANTRY

Rakonin is answering the telephone.

RAKONIN
(into phone)
Room service... Just a moment please.

He beckons to someone out of the scene. Leon enters the scene 
and takes the telephone.

LEON
(with an assumed French 
accent -- into phone)
Room service speaking.

CLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA -- AT THE PHONE

NINOTCHKA
(into phone)
Send me a plate of raw carrots and 
beets, beets predominating on a ratio 
of sixty-forty... What? There is a 
strike in the kitchen? Good! Will 
you assure the strikers of my hearty 
sympathy in their cause. I hope they 
will not weaken in their demands and 
tell them to put no dressing 
whatsoever on my vegetables... What? 
You won't serve me either? Now look 
here, Comrade, I think it is a fine 
idea to let the capitalists go without 
luncheon but when you keep food away 
from me you're weakening the people.

CLOSE SHOT -- ROOM-SERVICE PANTRY -- LEON AT PHONE

LEON
(into phone)
So! You want to make a strike breaker 
out of me! I am surprised at you, 
Comrade! Is it too much for the 
workers of the world to ask you to 
walk around the corner for lunch? 
All I can say to you is take your 
hammer and sickle and get out of 
that Royal Suite!

He hangs up the telephone with a triumphant smile.

DISSOLVE TO:

LOBBY OF THE HOTEL CLARENCE

Ninotchka emerges from the elevator and starts toward the 
street. As she passes the showcase of the millinery shop 
again, she stops and looks at the same hat. Again she shakes 
her head sadly.

NINOTCHKA
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

She walks toward the street, as we

EXTERIOR, HOTEL CLARENCE

DISSOLVE TO:

A taxi is parked at the curb. Ninotchka comes from the hotel 
and goes to the taxi.

CLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA AND TAXI DRIVER

The Driver puts his hand on the handle of his cab's door 
expectantly.

TAXI DRIVER
Where to, madame?

NINOTCHKA
Can you recommend a restaurant?

TAXI DRIVER
Well, there's Pruniers if you care 
for seafood. If you want to lunch in 
the Bois, there's...

NINOTCHKA
(interrupting)
Where do you eat?

TAXI DRIVER
At Pre Mathieu's.

NINOTCHKA
Where is that?

TAXI DRIVER
It's just a place for workmen.

NINOTCHKA
Where is it?

TAXI DRIVER
Eight blocks down in the Rue de 
Poivrel.

He opens the door of his cab.

NINOTCHKA
Thank you.

She turns and starts away in the direction he has indicated. 
The Driver looks after her astounded.

The CAMERA PANS from her to the car which stands behind the 
taxi. It is Leon's smart roadster. Leon sits at the wheel. 
He too is looking after Ninotchka, astonished. He gets out 
of his car and starts in the direction she has taken. As he 
does so, we

DISSOLVE TO:

PARIS STREET -- IN FRONT OF PRE MATHIEU'S

Pre Mathieu's is a workman's restaurant set a few steps 
below the level of the sidewalk. A few typical French workmen 
are going in for lunch. Ninotchka enters the scene, looks 
around for a second, then goes in too.

INTERIOR -- PRE MATHIEU'S

It is a pleasantly simple place crowded with workmen sitting 
at lunch. An electric piano is playing. Pre Mathieu, greeting 
all his guests like a typical restaurateur, sees Ninotchka 
enter.

PRE MATHIEU
This way, madame. Are you alone? By 
the window perhaps?
(He leads the way)
Or a nice little corner table?

NINOTCHKA
This will do.
(She sits down)

PRE MATHIEU
I think this is the first time you 
have been to my little place. Your 
face is new to me. Now, what shall 
it be?

NINOTCHKA
Raw carrots and beets.

PRE MATHIEU
(horrified)
Oh, madame! This is a restaurant, 
not a meadow.

He hands her a slate on which the menu is written.

PRE MATHIEU
Here is what we are offering today. 
Please make your choice. I am sure 
you will find something to tempt 
your appetite.

Suddenly Ninotchka stares in the direction of the door.

MEDIUM SHOT -- AT THE DOOR

Leon has just entered. The CAMERA follows him as he makes 
his way casually in Ninotchka's direction affecting not to 
see her. He seats himself at the table directly opposite 
Ninotchka and pretends to be overwhelmed with surprise as he 
sees her.

LEON
Why, hello! It certainly is a small 
world!

SHOT INCLUDING BOTH TABLES

PRE MATHIEU
(to Ninotchka)
Well, madame? Shall we start with 
soup? Fish soup today. I got up at 
five to fish them from the Seine.

LEON
(calling over to Pre 
Mathieu)
Crayfish soup for me!

PRE MATHIEU
(to Leon)
Very well, monsieur.
(back to Ninotchka)
Then, may I suggest an omelet with 
mushrooms?

NINOTCHKA
Bring me something simple. I never 
think about food.

PRE MATHIEU
(horrified)
But, madame! If you don't think about 
food what do you think about?

NINOTCHKA
The future of the common people.

PRE MATHIEU
(sagely)
That also is a question of food, 
madame. I'll bring you a nice little 
lunch  la Pre Mathieu.
(he exits)

Leon leans toward Ninotchka with mock humility.

LEON
Pardon me for addressing you but you 
insulted him, you know that. You 
hurt his feelings. It was just like 
telling a musician you don't like 
music. That good old man believes in 
food as you believe in Karl Marx. 
You can't go around hurting people, 
Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can 
make it up to him. Do you know how?
(He changes to the 
chair at his table 
which is closest to 
her table)
By eating everything with relish, by 
drinking everything with gusto, by 
having a good time for the first 
time in your natural life!

NINOTCHKA
I don't like your following me.

LEON
I didn't follow you.

NINOTCHKA
Then how did you get here?

LEON
I always eat here.

NINOTCHKA
This is a place for workmen.

LEON
(laying it on thick)
But my dear child, I am most at home 
among working men. I hate the places 
where you circulate -- the Hotel 
Clarence... This is my natural 
element. After all, what are any of 
us? Workingmen! At least, those of 
us who are worth our salt. Hyah?

He waves off scene to a truckman.

TRUCKMAN

He is in the middle of an enormous gulp of food. He registers 
surprise, winks at his companion, and then, deciding to humor 
a drunk, waves back energetically at Leon in greeting.

CUT BACK TO:

CLOSE SHOT -- LEON AND NINOTCHKA

Leon has been so successful with the truckman he tries it on 
another.

LEON
Hyah!

Another truckman responds with equal exuberance.

LONG SHOT -- RESTAURANT

Leon, intoxicated with his success, waves to the whole room.

LEON
Hyah, fellows!

He gets a wonderful response from all. They realize that a 
swell drunk is among them.

LEON AND NINOTCHKA

LEON
(boastfully)
They are all my friends. They're a 
swell bunch!

Pre Mathieu enters the shot and serves a plate of soup to 
Leon and one to Ninotchka.

LEON
(trying his bluff on 
Pre Mathieu)
Ah, my friend! I'm happy to see you 
again! 

PRE MATHIEU
I'm always glad to meet a new 
customer, and I hope this first visit 
will not be your last.

He exits out of shot.

Ninotchka, her suspicion confirmed, looks at Leon.

LEON
Just an old man. His memory is getting 
weak.

NINOTCHKA
What are you after?

LEON
Must one always be after something?

NINOTCHKA
Your tactics are useless. My name is 
neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor 
Kopalski.

LEON
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk 
business. If you win the suit, fine. 
If we win the suit, better. You do 
me an injustice.
(He moves over to her 
table, leaving the 
soup at his table)
When we went to my apartment did I 
have the slightest idea that you had 
any connection with this deal?

NINOTCHKA
But you have now, and I know now 
that you are a man who employs 
business methods which in Russia 
would be punished by death.

LEON
Death! Death! Always so glum! What 
about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians 
never think of life? Of the moment 
in which we are living? The only 
moment we really have? Don't take it 
all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing 
is worth it. Please... relax... I 
beg you, Sergeant... smile!

NINOTCHKA
(astonished)
What?

LEON
Will you smile?

NINOTCHKA
Why?

LEON
Just smile.

NINOTCHKA
At what?

LEON
At anything. At the whole ludicrous 
spectacle of life. At people being 
pompous and taking themselves 
seriously and exaggerating their own 
importance. If you can't find anything 
else to laugh at you can laugh at 
you and me.

NINOTCHKA
Why?

LEON
Because we are an odd couple.

NINOTCHKA
Then you should go back to your table.

LEON
No, I can't leave you. I won't. Not 
yet. Not until I've made you laugh... 
at least once.

To get rid of him Ninotchka emits a joyless sound which 
approximates a laugh.

NINOTCHKA
Ha! Ha! Now go back.

LEON
That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh 
from the heart. Now let's see. I'm 
going to tell you a funny story. 
Just a moment... I've got it! Well, 
it seems there were a couple of 
Frenchmen who went to America...

NINOTCHKA
On which boat?

LEON
(thrown off by her 
methodical thinking)
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't 
think you would care for that one.

NINOTCHKA
Probably not.

LEON
Do you like Scotch stories?

NINOTCHKA
I have never heard one.

LEON
Two Scotchmen met on the street... 
and I don't know the name of the 
street and it really doesn't matter. 
Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh 
and the other's was McGillicuddy. 
McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, 
Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy 
says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. 
McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to 
McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. 
McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy 
says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs. 
McIntosh?"...

NINOTCHKA
I wish they had never met.

LEON
(disarmed)
So do I.
(after a little pause)
Now, here's a great one... Ha! Ha! 
Ha!
(he looks at Ninotchka 
and her expression 
stops him)
Well, maybe it's not so good. Let's 
forget it! How's this? Two men are 
looking at the moon. One says to the 
other, "Is it true that a lot of 
people live on the moon?" "Yes, it 
is," says the other, "five hundred 
million." "Whew!" replies the first, 
"they must get pretty crowded when 
it's half moon!" Ha! Ha! Ha!

There is no response from Ninotchka.

LEON
(starting to get sore)
I suppose you don't think that's 
funny?

NINOTCHKA
No.

LEON
It seemed funny to me when I first 
heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't 
with the joke. Maybe it's with you!

NINOTCHKA
I don't think so.

LEON
Maybe you haven't any sense of humor. 
Well, I'll give you one more chance! 
Now listen!

He gets up and speaks in a threatening voice audible to the 
entire room.

LEON
When I heard this joke for the first 
time I laughed myself sick. Here 
goes! A man comes into a restaurant 
and sits down and says, "Waiter! Get 
me a cup of coffee without cream." 
After five minutes the waiter comes 
back and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we're 
all out of cream, can it be without 
milk?"

GROUP OF SEVERAL WORKMEN

They have overheard the story and all burst into laughter.

NINOTCHKA AND LEON

Ninotchka continues to eat her soup without a shadow of a 
laugh.

LEON
(furious)
Not funny, huh?

NINOTCHKA
No.

LEON
So you don't think that's funny? It 
is funny! Everyone else thinks so! 
Maybe you didn't get it.

He sits down again.

LEON
(threateningly)
I'll tell you that joke again. A man 
comes into a restaurant. Did you get 
that?

NINOTCHKA
Yes.

LEON
He sits down at the table and says 
to the waiter... Did you get that 
too?

NINOTCHKA
Yes.

LEON
Well, so far it isn't funny, but 
wait. He says to the waiter, "Waiter! 
Bring me a cup of coffee." So the 
waiter comes back five minutes later 
and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have 
no coffee."...
(he realizes he has 
made a mistake)
Wait a minute... wait a minute... 
I'm all mixed up...
(he starts over again)
A man comes in a restaurant, he sits 
down, he calls the waiter and he 
says, "Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee 
without cream," and five minutes 
later the waiter comes back and says, 
"I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, 
can it be a glass of milk!"

He gets up and goes over to his table furiously.

LEON
Ah! You have no sense of humor! That 
settles it! You have no sense of 
humor! None! No humor!!

In his excitement he leans on the shaky table. It topples 
forward. Simultaneously his feet shoot from under him and he 
sits violently on the floor, the contents of the table 
crashing about him, hot soup in his face.

A terrific roar of laughter arises; the whole restaurant is 
rocking with laughter.

For a split second Ninotchka makes an effort to control the 
irresistible impulse to laugh but loses the battle and herself 
roars with laughter.

LEON
(indignantly)
What's funny about this?

Ninotchka's laughter is uncontrollable.

After a moment Leon gets up and sits next to her. As he dries 
himself with his napkin he sees the humor of the situation 
and starts to howl with laughter too. The ice is broken at 
last!

On their mutual wild hilarity, we

FADE OUT:

LIVING ROOM -- ROYAL SUITE

FADE IN:

A conference is in session -- Ninotchka, her two Lawyers, 
and the Three Russians. Ninotchka sits at the desk, leaning 
back in the chair, looking into space, and apparently weighing 
every point which is brought up. One of the lawyers is reading 
from a document.

LAWYER
(reading)
In addition to the arguments above 
enumerated for lifting this 
injunction, we wish to cite the 
decision of the High Court of Paris, 
rendered in the case of Princess 
Marishka against the Government of 
Montenegro on the fifth day of August, 
1897. Comparing the facts in that 
case with our present set of facts 
we feel that the Treaty between the 
Republic of France and the U.S.S.R. 
should prevail over all...

Suddenly Ninotchka laughs. Everyone looks at her astonished. 
Ninotchka gets up.

NINOTCHKA
I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day 
I heard such a funny story...
(she laughs again)
It still makes me laugh. It is very 
funny.
(a little embarrassed)
I am sorry. Oh yes... about this 
injunction...

LAWYER
(very businesslike)
The hearing is set for the twentieth 
of this month.

NINOTCHKA
(not thinking of the 
injunction)
That's two weeks from Thursday...

LAWYER
We did our utmost to have it set 
ahead.

NINOTCHKA
(her attitude 
completely different 
from her former 
business conferences)
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the 
hands of the Court. We're helpless, 
aren't we?

LAWYER
Yes. It is unfortunate.

NINOTCHKA
Well, there's nothing we can do about 
it. Why get excited?

The Three Russians as well as the Lawyers are puzzled.

The Russians exchange hopeful glances.

LAWYER
We'll leave these papers here for 
your further consideration. Au revoir, 
madame.

NINOTCHKA
Au revoir.

The Lawyers leave.

Left alone with the Russians, Ninotchka is unable to conceal 
her happiness entirely.

NINOTCHKA
Well, it means another two weeks in 
Paris.

IRANOFF
(with exaggerated 
efficiency)
Too bad we have to waste all that 
time.

KOPALSKI
I acted on your suggestion and got 
in touch with the Power and Light 
authorities. Whenever you want to 
visit their plants they are open to 
you.

NINOTCHKA
(a little bit dreamily)
Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.

BULJANOFF
There's something else which I know 
will appeal to you. A visit to the 
Paris sewers. They tell me it is 
extremely instructive.

NINOTCHKA
Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut, 
Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, 
Comrades. And why do we always keep 
the windows closed?
(she opens the window)
Isn't it amazing, at home there's 
still snow and ice and here... Look 
at the birds. I always felt a little 
hurt that our swallows deserted us 
in the winter for capitalistic 
countries. Now I know why. We have 
the high ideal but they have the 
climate... well, Comrades, I don't 
think I need you any more.

KOPALSKI
If there is anything we can do for 
you...

NINOTCHKA
No, not a thing. Would you like to 
go out?

ALL THREE RUSSIANS
Thank you, Comrade.

NINOTCHKA
Have you any money?

The Russians stammer a negative answer.

Smiling benevolently, Ninotchka goes to the table, takes 
several bills from her handbag, and goes back, extending a 
fifty-franc bill to Kopalski.

NINOTCHKA
Well, here are fifty francs.

ALL THREE RUSSIANS
(overwhelmed)
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.

NINOTCHKA
Bring me forty-five back.

ALL THREE RUSSIANS
(terribly disappointed)
Naturally, Comrade.

The Three Russians leave. Ninotchka waits a moment. Then 
hurries to the door and turns the key. Camera follows her as 
she goes into the bedroom. She proceeds to the door leading 
to the corridor and turns its key. She goes to the table and 
takes a little key from her handbag, goes to the bureau and 
unlocks the drawer, opens it, and, just as she is about to 
take out something, her eye falls on the night table, where 
she sees the picture of Lenin which she brought with her 
from Moscow. She walks over to it and turns its face against 
the wall, then goes back to the bureau and takes from the 
drawer the very hat which twice aroused her disapproval when 
it was displayed in the millinery shop in the lobby.

She moves over to the large mirror, puts the hat on her head, 
is uncertain whether it is right side to fore, and changes 
it. She looks at herself, aghast at seeing a complete 
stranger. She sits down, still staring in the mirror, then 
leans forward and rests her chin on her hand. As she sits 
studying the new Ninotchka suspiciously, we

LIVING ROOM -- LEON'S APARTMENT

DISSOLVE TO:

It is evening. Leon is walking nervously up and down. Gaston 
is puttering over the drink table.

LEON
(consulting his watch)
What time have you, Gaston?

GASTON
Eight forty-two, sir.

LEON
I guess it is eight forty-two.

GASTON
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.

LEON
I am, Gaston.

GASTON
If you will forgive me, ever since 
you met that Bolshevik lady I've 
noticed a distinct change in you, 
sir.

LEON
(complacently)
Have you?

GASTON
Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly 
amazed when I came from the market 
and found that you had made your 
bed, sir.

LEON
And Gaston, I was happier all day 
long. I felt I'd contributed 
something.

GASTON
Well, sir, if you should do it again, 
which I hope you won't, please 
remember the order. Counterpane, 
blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.

LEON
Ah, there's something poetic about 
the simple processes of labor. 
Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, 
sheet... it should be set to music!

GASTON
May I add, sir, that it was with 
great amazement that I found a copy 
of Karl Marx's Capital on your night 
table. That is a socialistic volume 
which I refuse to so much as dust, 
sir. I view with alarm, sir, the 
influence over you of this Bolshevik 
lady.

LEON
I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it 
about time that you realized the 
unfairness of your position? You 
being my servant? Wouldn't you like 
to stand on an equal footing with 
me?

GASTON
No, sir.

LEON
Isn't there any revolt in you? 
Sometimes when I order you around 
don't you feel like kicking me in 
the pants?

GASTON
(emphatically)
No, sir.

LEON
Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you 
look forward to the day when you can 
come in here and stand square on 
your two feet and say, "Hey, you, 
d'Algout! from now on it's going to 
be share and share alike"?

GASTON
(outraged)
Emphatically not, sir. The prospect 
terrifies me. Now, don't misunderstand 
me, sir, I don't resent your not 
paying me for the past two months, 
but the thought that I should split 
my bank account with you... that you 
should take half of my life's 
savings... that is really too much 
for me.

The door bell rings. Gaston starts for the door. With a 
gesture Leon stops him.

LEON
Go to bed, little father, go to bed.

Gaston leaves through the other door as Leon exits toward 
the entrance hall.

ENTRANCE HALL -- LEON'S APARTMENT

Leon enters the scene. He opens the door. Outside stands 
Ninotchka wearing her new hat timidly as well as a completely 
new outfit which she has bought, apparently to match the new 
hat. It takes Leon a few seconds to digest her new splendor. 
He takes her hand and leads her in, closing the door. He 
looks at her again and kisses her hand.

NINOTCHKA
I don't look too foolish?

LEON
Foolish? If this dress were to walk 
down the boulevard all by itself I 
would follow it from one end of Paris 
to the other, and when I caught up 
with it I would say, "Just a moment, 
you charming little dress, I want 
you to meet Ninotchka... you two 
were meant for each other." Ninotchka 
feels more comfortable.

Leon leads her into the living room.

LIVING ROOM -- LEON'S APARTMENT

They both enter. Ninotchka pauses a second and looks around.

LEON
You remember this room?

NINOTCHKA
I've never been here before. I wonder 
whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, 
a girl with a map, figuring out each 
step, worrying about north and south. 
Today... now this might shock you... 
I went up to a taxi and said "Eight 
Rue du Bois"... and here I am.

LEON
You see? Life can be so simple.

NINOTCHKA
For twelve francs, seventy-five.

LEON
Twelve seventy-five from the Clarence? 
The son-of-a-gun made a detour!...
(charmingly)
But he got you here.

At this moment the clock starts to strike. They both look 
toward it.

INSERT -- CLOCK

The hands register nine o'clock.

LEON AND NINOTCHKA

Leon wants to take her in his arms. She resists a little.

NINOTCHKA
(reprimanding him)
It's nine o'clock.

LEON
That's when one half of Paris says 
to the other half, "What are your 
plans for this evening, madame?"

NINOTCHKA
(getting more and 
more in the spirit 
of her change of 
appearance)
Well, first I should like to take 
off my hat and jacket.
(Leon takes them)
Then could we have some music?

LEON
A wonderful idea! Radio or records?

NINOTCHKA
Not radio. Let's have music that's 
just for ourselves.

Leon turns on the victrola.

LEON
(with great feeling 
and sincerity)
I'll play it softly because I have 
things to tell you about which I 
can't shout.

He walks back to Ninotchka, who by now is seated in an 
armchair. He sits on the arm of the chair. He tries to make 
a declaration of his love. He stammers several words.

LEON
Well, my darling... I... we...

It is no use. In a sudden outburst of emotion he takes her 
in his arms and kisses her.

LEON
(as they come out of 
the kiss)
You see I couldn't shout that.

NINOTCHKA
(with great feeling)
Leon, you know the jokes you told me 
a few days ago? I wake up in the 
middle of the night and laugh at 
them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know 
they're not funny, they're silly. 
They're stupid. And still... I 
laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff 
and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they 
are scoundrels and I should hate 
them -- then I realize who made them 
like that, and instead of sending my 
report to Moscow I tear it up and go 
down and buy a ridiculous hat... and 
if this keeps on... am I too 
talkative?

LEON
(radiantly)
No... go on.

NINOTCHKA
Leon, I want to tell you something 
which I thought I never would say, 
which I thought nobody ever should 
say, because I thought it didn't 
exist... and, Leon... I can't say 
it...

They kiss again. As the kiss ends they look at each other 
for a second.

Ninotchka gets up and goes toward the desk, sits in the desk 
chair, opens her handbag, which lies there, and takes from 
it a little mirror and a lipstick. Before she uses it she 
looks at Leon with guilty happiness. Leon looks at her with 
great tenderness and walks over to the desk and stands looking 
at her as she makes up her lips.

LEON
What a gesture for a sergeant.

As soon as she is finished, Ninotchka slips the mirror and 
lipstick back into her handbag and, as she does so, glances 
at the top of the desk.

NINOTCHKA
Leon, I would like to ask you 
something.

LEON
Anything, Ninotchka.

NINOTCHKA
If you don't want to answer, you 
needn't. But if you do, you must 
tell me the truth.

LEON
I promise... I swear.

NINOTCHKA
(seriously)
Did you make any change in this room?

LEON
I don't think so.

NINOTCHKA
When I was here before I noticed a 
photograph of a woman on the desk in 
a wide silver frame. I thought what 
a waste of silver. That's all that 
interested me then. Now I would like 
to know... what happened to the woman?

Leon too is completely serious by now. For answer he quietly 
opens the drawer of the desk. Ninotchka looks in and takes 
from the drawer the photograph. As she looks at it she rises.

NINOTCHKA
The Duchess.

Leon nods gravely.

NINOTCHKA
(looking at the picture)
She is very attractive. She has great 
elegance.
(she looks back at 
Leon)
She's what you call a woman of the 
world, isn't she?

LEON
(after a little pause)
Ninotchka, I love you.

NINOTCHKA
I suppose she is very entertaining... 
It must be lots of fun to be with 
her, so witty, so glamorous...

LEON
Ninotchka, you're jealous.

Ninotchka nods sadly.

NINOTCHKA
(with great feeling)
Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture 
of myself... I couldn't bear the 
thought of being shut up in a 
drawer... I couldn't breathe, I 
couldn't stand it.

LEON
My darling.

As he takes her in his arms, we

FADE OUT:

INTERIOR, SMART NIGHT CLUB

FADE IN:

Duchess Swana enters with a party consisting of General 
Savitzky and five other smartly dressed people of the world. 
The Headwaiter hurries to greet Swana.

HEADWAITER
Good evening, Your Highness.

SWANA
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be 
very crowded tonight. Can you manage 
a table near the floor?

HEADWAITER
Certainly, Your Highness, this way 
please... Count d'Algout made the 
reservation this afternoon.

SWANA
(puzzled)
Count d'Algout...

HEADWAITER
It is only a small table but it will 
be no trouble to put in some extra 
chairs.

Swana has grasped the situation by now.

SWANA
No, that's another party.

In order to save the situation one of the ladies makes a 
suggestion.

LADY
Why don't we go some other place? 
It's so crowded here.

SWANA
(delighted at her 
luck)
No, no! This is glory! At last I'm 
going to have a look at that female 
Bolshevik. Can you give us another 
table?

HEADWAITER
Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.

SWANA
That's perfect!

Camera moves with the group as the Headwaiter leads it toward 
a table.

ANOTHER WOMAN GUEST
You mean Leon's bringing the Bolshevik 
you told us about?

SWANA
Isn't it divine?

ANOTHER GUEST
I wouldn't have missed this for the 
world.

SWANA
(very gay, in 
anticipation of a 
triumph)
Now, we must be very discreet. If 
she sucks her soup and drinks out of 
her finger bowl, I don't want anyone 
to laugh.
(everybody in the 
party giggles)
We must not embarrass little Leon. 
He is going through enough for my 
sake. We mustn't add insult to injury

By now they have reached the table in the rear.

HEADWAITER
Is this satisfactory?

SWANA
Thank you, Louis.

They sit down. The Headwaiter bends over General Savitzky, 
an elderly Russian aristocrat, who sits next to Swana.

HEADWAITER
Is it to be dinner, monsieur?

GENERAL SAVITZKY
Possibly later. We'll just start 
with champagne.

SWANA
(to the party)
I'm only afraid that the doorman may 
spoil our fun. If only he lets her 
in!

Swana laughs and everyone joins in her laughter.

GENERAL SAVITZKY
Your Highness...

SWANA
Yes, General Savitzky?

GENERAL SAVITZKY
I want you to know all the White 
Russian exiles in Paris are keeping 
their fingers crossed about the 
jewels. They are very interested in 
the case. Swana suspects her 
countrymen.

SWANA
Are they indeed? Thank you.

GENERAL SAVITZKY
They hope the settlement will bring 
you a fortune.

SWANA
General, please... if you hear any 
rumors that I am a charitable person, 
will you please kill them at their 
source?

As she is lighting a cigarette a guest suddenly looks toward 
the entrance and sees Leon.

GUEST
Look! There's Leon!

Joyfully Swana looks toward the entrance, as does everyone 
else at the table.

EVERYONE AT THE TABLE
Oh yes! Where? There! Oh! How 
exciting!

CLOSE SHOT -- LEON AT THE ENTRANCE

Suddenly, through the door of the cloakroom comes Ninotchka, 
radiant in a beautiful evening gown.

SWANA'S TABLE

Swana's expression freezes as she sees Ninotchka. The rest 
of the guests stare in an embarrassed silence, save for one 
bird-brained little guest, named Marianne, who feels it her 
mission to save the situation.

MARIANNE
Isn't she something?

A neighbor nudges her warningly. Swana withers her with a 
glance and rises.

SWANA
Shall we dance, General Savitzky?

Swana and the General leave for the dance floor. The guest 
who has nudged her turns to Marianne.

GUEST
Are you crazy?

ANOTHER GUEST
How could you make such a remark?

THIRD GUEST
Swana isn't stupid.

MARIANNE
What did I say? I just said "isn't 
she something?" I didn't say something 
what.

CLOSE SHOT -- LEON'S TABLE

Leon and Ninotchka are seated and a Waiter stands by them 
presenting a bottle of champagne to Leon for his approval.

LEON
(to Waiter)
Is it dry?

WAITER
Yes, monsieur.

LEON
(to Ninotchka)
Is that right or do you prefer it 
sweet?

NINOTCHKA
I wouldn't know. The closest I ever 
came to champagne was in a newsreel. 
The wife of some president was 
throwing it at a battleship.

LEON
It's always good luck to launch 
something with champagne; a 
battleship... or an evening.

By now the Waiter is filling their glasses. Ninotchka lifts 
her glass and looks at it.

NINOTCHKA
It's funny to look back. I was brought 
up on goat's milk, I had a ration of 
vodka in the army, and now champagne.

LEON
(gaily)
From goats to grapes. That's drinking 
in the right direction.

Ninotchka takes her first sip of champagne. Leon drinks and 
watches her. The first sip proves a painful surprise. 
Ninotchka's face is that of a child who has been fed a bad 
medicine.

NINOTCHKA
Ugh... um... oh...
(slowly the delight 
of champagne dawns 
on her and her face 
breaks into a smile)
It's good.

She drinks the whole glass at once. Leon looks at her in 
amused surprise. He drinks too. The Waiter fills their glasses 
again.

NINOTCHKA
From what I read I thought champagne 
was a strong drink. It's very 
delicate. Do people ever get drunk 
on this?

LEON
There have been cases... but the 
headache the next morning is worth 
while -- if you drink it with the 
right toast.
(he raises his glass 
again fondly)
To us, Ninotchka!

They clink glasses and drink again, looking at each other.

LONG SHOT OF THE TABLE, including part of the dance floor.

As Leon and Ninotchka lift their glasses again, Swana and 
General Savitzky start to dance by the table. Swana stops, 
pretending complete astonishment.

SWANA
Hello, Leon! What a surprise! You of 
all people! How are you, my dear?

Leon gets up. Ninotchka watches the scene tensely.

LEON
(embarrassed)
Hello, Swana. How do you do, General 
Savitzky?

GENERAL SAVITZKY
How do you do?

SWANA
(to Leon)
You're looking magnificent, Leon...
(to General Savitzky)
...isn't he, General Savitzky?

GENERAL SAVITZKY
Yes.

Leon knows that Swana wants to embarrass him but is 
embarrassed nevertheless.

LEON
Thank you.

SWANA
Is this your new dress suit?

LEON
Yes, Swana.

SWANA
Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson 
were the tailors for you?

LEON
(patiently)
Yes, Swana, you did.

SWANA
It's a dream of beauty. He never 
takes my word for anything, but I 
was right, wasn't I?

LEON
Yes, Swana.

SWANA
(forcing an 
introduction)
Am I interrupting?

LEON
Not at all. Your Highness, may I 
present Madame Yakushova?

SWANA
How do you do?

NINOTCHKA
How do you do?

LEON
And General Savitzky.

GENERAL SAVITZKY
How do you do?

NINOTCHKA
How do you do?

SWANA
I've some wonderful news for you, 
Leon. It's about Punchy... do you 
mind if I sit down?

LEON
(realizing that he 
cannot prevent it)
No... please...

Swana sits down.

SWANA
(to General Savitzky)
General, would you mind making my 
excuses at our table? I'll be back 
in a few moments.

GENERAL SAVITZKY
Certainly.

He bows and leaves.

CLOSE SHOT -- ALL THREE SITTING AT THE TABLE

SWANA
Well, Leon, we can be proud of our 
Punchy. He had a triumph at the dog 
show.

During the following speech, Ninotchka's expression does not 
change. She knows exactly the game Swana is playing.

SWANA
(continuing)
He won another blue ribbon and bit 
the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him 
the cutest sweater as a reward. You 
should see him strut down the street 
in it. He looks like a little 
boulevardier.
(to Ninotchka)
You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy 
for my birthday.
(to Leon)
You must have searched weeks before 
you found anything as divine as 
Punchy, didn't you, Leon?

LEON
(fed up with Swana's 
tactics)
Months, Swana.

SWANA
(to Ninotchka)
Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are 
talking in mysteries.... I'm sure 
you wonder what it's all about.

NINOTCHKA
(dry and direct)
Not at all.... I understand perfectly, 
Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You 
made it very clear, madame.

SWANA
Dear me... I must be losing my 
finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be 
understood by everybody.

LEON
(acutely uncomfortable)
There's a charming crowd here tonight, 
isn't there?

SWANA
I'm going, Leon...
(she rises, as does 
Leon, delighted to 
get rid of her)
but before I leave I must compliment 
you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. 
Is that what they're wearing in Moscow 
this year?

NINOTCHKA
No, last year, madame.

Swana sits again, as does Leon.

SWANA
Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong 
impression of the new Russia.
(cynically)
It must be charming. I'm glad 
conditions are so improved. I assume 
this is what the factory workers 
wear at their dances?

NINOTCHKA
Exactly. You see, it would have been 
embarrassing for people of my sort 
to wear low-cut gowns in the old 
Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks 
across our backs were not very 
becoming, and you know how vain women 
are.

SWANA
You're absolutely right about the 
Cossacks. We made an unpardonable 
mistake when we let them use their 
knouts. They had such reliable guns.

Leon has grown more and more uncomfortable as the two ladies 
fence.

LEON
Will you do me a favor? Stop talking 
about the good old days.

SWANA
A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm 
afraid madame and I will never agree.
(she plays her trump 
card)
The only thing we have in common is 
our lawsuit and that will be decided 
next week. I understand everything 
will be over by Thursday. Am I right?

Ninotchka and Leon realize the malice and yet the truth of 
her words.

NINOTCHKA
You're right, madame, it will all be 
over by Thursday.

SWANA
(rubbing it in)
It is unfortunate that you have so 
few more days in Paris.
(she turns to Leon)
Be sure and redouble your efforts so 
that madame can take some pleasant 
memories when she returns to Moscow.
(she rises, Leon rising 
too)
Good night.
(Ninotchka nods without 
answering. To Leon)
Good night, Leon.

LEON
(coldly)
Good night, Swana.

Swana leaves the table. Leon sits again. The mood of the two 
has been changed by the problem of their separation, which 
has been brought before them. They sit in silence for a 
moment. Ninotchka speaks first.

NINOTCHKA
Now I think I need a glass of 
champagne.

Leon fills their glasses. They drink. Then Leon takes 
Ninotchka's hand.

NINOTCHKA
(trying to break the 
mood)
Quickly, please... tell me one of 
your funny stories.

LEON
A funny story?

NINOTCHKA
You never finished the one about the 
two Scotchmen with the names.

LEON
Well, there were two Scotchmen. One 
was named McIntosh and one was named 
McGillicuddy. They met on the street.

He stops.

NINOTCHKA
Go on.

LEON
No, darling. I'll tell you another 
story, a much better one.
(with deep sincerity)
The only thing that will be over on 
Thursday is the lawsuit. There will 
be no Thursday for us. Not next week 
or any week. We won't let it happen. 
I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is 
that a good story?

NINOTCHKA
(touched)
Wonderful -- if one could believe 
it.

LEON
You must, darling.

NINOTCHKA
(lifting her glass)
To the loveliest story I ever heard.

They drink. The orchestra starts a number.

NINOTCHKA
(afraid of where the 
conversation may 
lead)
Shall we dance?

They both start toward the dance floor.

CLOSE SHOT -- LEON AND NINOTCHKA, DANCING A WALTZ

At the second turn Ninotchka starts to feel the effect of 
the champagne.

NINOTCHKA
(tipsily)
Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.

LEON
You just made that trip from goats 
to grapes a little too fast.

NINOTCHKA
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's 
getting farther and farther away!

LEON
What, darling?

NINOTCHKA
Thursday.

LEON
Yes. Don't worry. Everything will be 
all right.

In the gayest mood, Ninotchka addresses the crowd on the 
dance floor.

NINOTCHKA
Comrades! Comrades!

LEON
(embarrassed)
Darling, darling... please!

NINOTCHKA
I must talk to my brothers!

LEON
Shhh! Shhh!

NINOTCHKA
Don't shush me. I am People! I want 
to make a speech. I want to overthrow 
the Duchess!

Leon starts to lead her off the dance floor.

LEON
But, darling, you can't do that.

NINOTCHKA
Comrades! Good people of France!

LEON
Now, Ninotchka... please!

NINOTCHKA
They are all Duchesses here... 
thousands of Duchesses... and I am 
going to tell them.

By now they have almost reached the powder room.

LEON
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but 
first you're going in that door and 
you're going to take a little spirits 
of ammonia and lie down.

NINOTCHKA
(sweetly)
No speech?

LEON
(as though he were 
addressing a little 
child)
No speech.

NINOTCHKA
I love you, my little Leonitchka!

LEON
And I adore you, Ninotchua.

Ninotchka goes unsteadily into the powder room. Leon wipes 
his forehead in relief and goes to the bar, followed by the 
CAMERA.

LEON
(to the bartender)
Give me a double brandy.

CLOSE SHOT -- DOOR OF THE POWDER ROOM

A group of four to six women come out whispering excitedly 
about something which must have happened within.

CAMERA goes with them as they go to the Manager of the 
restaurant and crowd about him and whisper what has happened.

CLOSE SHOT -- BAR

The bartender gives Leon his double brandy and Leon tosses 
it off. The Manager comes into the shot and addresses Leon.

MANAGER
(very excitedly)
I'm very sorry, Count d'Algout, it 
is most embarrassing, but the lady 
you brought with you tonight is 
spreading communistic propaganda in 
the powder room.

Leon stares at him for a second, then turns to the bartender.

LEON
Give me another double brandy.

MANAGER
That kind of propaganda is bad 
anywhere, but inciting the attendants 
of a powder room to go on strike.... 
Well, if she succeeds the consequences 
will be disastrous.

LEON
What can I do about it?

MANAGER
She has been asked to leave the powder 
room but without success. We would 
appreciate if you would see to it 
yourself.

LEON
(horrified)
You want me to go in there?

MANAGER
I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.

The Manager bows and walks away. Leon gulps down the second 
double brandy. The CAMERA follows him as he proceeds toward 
the powder room like a hero going into battle. Just as he is 
about to enter, a very dignified elderly lady comes out, is 
surprised at his attempted entrance, and glares at him. Leon 
loses his courage and FOLLOWED BY THE CAMERA goes back to 
the bar to strengthen it with some of the Dutch variety.

LEON
(completely exhausted -- 
to the bartender)
Make it a triple brandy. As we

DISSOLVE TO:

LIVING ROOM -- THE ROYAL SUITE

Rakonin, the waiter, opens the door. Ninotchka and Leon, 
both very tipsy by now, enter the room. Leon is carrying a 
bottle of champagne in a napkin. As he passes the waiter he 
speaks:

LEON
(to Rakonin)
All right... you can tell the 
Duchess... you can tell everybody... 
they know anyhow... it doesn't make 
any difference... now get out!

Rakonin, who seems very interested in the situation, closes 
the door.

Leon goes to Ninotchka. Both sit on a couch.

NINOTCHKA
(moving close to him)
Don't tell them where we're going, 
sweetheart.

LEON
No. Nobody will find us.

Ninotchka is lyrically tight. Through her there shines a 
great happiness.

NINOTCHKA
Are we going to build our little 
house?

LEON
Yes... a little white house.

NINOTCHKA
Not white, darling.

LEON
All right, we'll make it red.

NINOTCHKA
No, don't let's have it any color... 
no color... just a house house... 
let's form our own party.

LEON
Right: Lovers of the world unite!

NINOTCHKA
(delighted)
And we won't stretch up our arms...

LEON
No! No!

NINOTCHKA
...and we won't clench our fist...

LEON
No! No!

NINOTCHKA
(tenderly)
Our salute will be a kiss.

LEON
Yes... a kiss... salute!

She sinks into his arms and they kiss.

NINOTCHKA
(still in his arms)
I am so happy. No one can be so happy 
without being punished. I will be 
punished and I should be punished.
(she gets up)
I want to confess, darling.

LEON
I know... it's the Russian soul.

NINOTCHKA
(her gaiety mixed 
with sadness)
Everyone wants to confess and if 
they don't confess they make them 
confess. I am a traitor. When I kissed 
you I betrayed the Russian ideal. 
Leon, I should be stood up against 
the wall.

Leon gets up.

LEON
(sympathetically)
Would that make you any happier?

NINOTCHKA
Much happier.

LEON
All right.

Still carrying the champagne bottle, Leon leads her to the 
end of the room and stands her against the wall. He takes 
the napkin from the champagne bottle and puts it over her 
eyes. The CAMERA moves with him as he goes away from 
Ninotchka, and as he walks he starts to open the champagne. 
The cork pops.

CLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA, as she sinks gently into a chair.

NINOTCHKA
(happily)
I have paid the penalty. Now let's 
have some music.

CLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA AND LEON

LEON
Let's turn on the radio.

NINOTCHKA
Radio! What is radio?

LEON
It's a little box that you buy on 
the installment plan and before you 
tune it in they tell you they have a 
new model.

NINOTCHKA
(getting up)
Oh yes, yes. It has a little knob 
that turns... a little knob... it 
must be somewhere around here... 
yes... here... I see...

Confusedly Ninotchka starts looking for something, repeating, 
"a little knob... a little knob." Followed by Leon she goes 
toward the safe, opens the concealing door, and both are 
delighted as they see the safe's dial.

NINOTCHKA
(triumphantly)
Here it is!

Leon nods approval and starts to turn the dial.

LEON
What shall we get? The news!

NINOTCHKA
No, no news. We don't want to know 
what's happening in the world. We 
want to be left alone, don't we?

LEON
Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.

NINOTCHKA
(remembering vaguely)
Well, then we turn twice to the right 
and stop at seven...

Leon follows her instructions.

NINOTCHKA
(after a little pause, 
sadly)
It's dead.

LEON
Well, it has to warm up... you have 
to give it a chance... just like 
people... like you and me... first 
you wanted to fight me and now we 
belong to the same party... salute!

He takes her in his arms and again they embrace.

NINOTCHKA
(as though she were 
in heaven)
Now twice to the left and stop at 
seventeen.

Leon again follows her instructions.

INTERIOR -- SAFE, shooting toward the door.

Leon opens the door and both look into the safe.

NINOTCHKA
(disappointed)
No music.

LEON
(also disappointed)
No, no music.

Through her fog, Ninotchka becomes aware of the case 
containing the jewels.

NINOTCHKA
(bitterly)
There it is... Thursday... you can't 
rip it out of the week....

LEON
(helpfully)
But I can throw it out of the window.

NINOTCHKA
(philosophically)
It wouldn't be fair to the man in 
the street.
(she pushes back the 
lid)
There they are... they are terrible 
things, those jewels....

LEON
...but big.

NINOTCHKA
...they are the tears of Old Russia... 
see that stone?

LEON
Who cried that one?

NINOTCHKA
Czar Peter gave it to his wife, 
Catherine the Great. For it he sold 
ten thousand serfs in the market.

LEON
Now, darling, don't get impatient, 
wait until we are married. You know 
that worthless butler of mine... 
that reactionary? Some day when I 
come home to you I may say, "Darling, 
I drove Gaston to the market and 
look what I got from him!"

From the case of jewels he takes a beautiful diadem and holds 
it in front of her.

NINOTCHKA
(the economist now)
First ten thousand serfs... now just 
Gaston. It is very encouraging.

Leon takes her by the hand and leads her from the safe.

LEON
Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on 
you. You will teach these jewels. 
For the first time they will learn 
how they can look.

NINOTCHKA
They belong to the people.

LEON
(in a ceremonial voice)
I give them back to the people...
(as formal and steady 
as possible under 
the conditions he 
puts the diadem on 
her head)
I make you Ninotchka the Great... 
Duchess of the People!... Grand 
Duchess of the People!

Ninotchka falls in with the spirit of this imaginary 
coronation.

NINOTCHKA
Is this the wish of the masses?

LEON
It is their wish.

NINOTCHKA
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.
(in a low voice)
Can I make a speech now?

LEON
Please.

Ninotchka turns to an imaginary assemblage.

NINOTCHKA
Comrades! People of the world! The 
revolution is on the march... I 
know... wars will wash over us... 
bombs will fall... all civilization 
will crumble... but not yet, please... 
wait, wait... what's the hurry?
(mixing reality with 
fantasy)
Let us be happy... give us our 
moment....
(turning to Leon)
We are happy, aren't we, Leon?

LEON
(fondly)
Yes, sweetheart.
(he holds her in his 
arms)

NINOTCHKA
(her voice getting 
dimmer and dimmer)
So happy and so tired.

She falls asleep in his arms. Leon gathers her up and carries 
her into the bedroom, the diadem still on her head.

BEDROOM -- THE ROYAL SUITE

Leon carries Ninotchka to the bed, puts her down on it. She 
is now sleeping soundly. He kisses her once more and then 
turns, the CAMERA PANNING with him, and starts toward the 
door to the corridor and exits. As he closes the door with 
an uncertain hand, it slams.

CLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA, as she lies on the bed

On the night table beside her is a photograph of the stern-
faced Lenin. The crash of the slamming door awakens Ninotchka 
for a moment. Completely content and happy, she turns around 
and sees the disapproving face of the photograph.

NINOTCHKA
(charmingly)
Smile, little father, smile.

INSERT OF PHOTOGRAPH OF LENIN

The photograph of Lenin starts to smile in approval, as we...

FADE OUT:

AN ESTABLISHING SHOT OF PARIS -- DAY

FADE IN ON:

IN THE FOREGROUND a clock shows that it is a quarter to 
twelve.

DISSOLVE TO:

LONG SHOT -- LIVING ROOM OF THE ROYAL SUITE

It is taken from an ANGLE which includes the door. The lights 
are still on, the curtains drawn, the empty champagne bottle 
and glasses litter the room. We hear the buzzer of the 
corridor door ring several times without an answer.

CAMERA moves through the door into the bedroom, never 
disclosing the bed. The lights in the bedroom are still 
lighted also and the curtains drawn. CAMERA stops on the 
door from the bedroom to the corridor. The buzzer rings. 
Apparently the caller has moved from the living-room door to 
the bedroom door.

CLOSE SHOT OF THE BED

Ninotchka is lying on the bed, still in her evening dress. 
The diadem is no longer on her head, but no special emphasis 
is laid on that detail in the camera angle. We hear the sound 
of the buzzer ringing again and again. Ninotchka half wakens 
and calls out something which sounds like "come in" without 
being fully aware of what she is doing.

BEDROOM -- AT THE DOOR

The door is opened from the outside by a maid, who lets in 
the Duchess Swana, dressed in a smart morning outfit. Swana 
looks around, surprised and amused at the state of the room. 
She walks over to the bed where lies Ninotchka, still not 
enough awake to face reality. Swana is delighted to have 
surprised Ninotchka in this condition.

SWANA
(ironically)
Good morning.

NINOTCHKA
(awakening gradually)
What?

SWANA
It is tomorrow morning... tomorrow 
noon, to be exact. I hope you will 
forgive me. I know it's extremely 
cruel to waken anyone at such an 
hour. Don't you recognize me? I am 
the Duchess Swana.

By now Ninotchka is awake. She gets up and realizes to her 
acute embarrassment the condition in which Swana has found 
her.

SWANA
I know how you feel, my dear. The 
morning after always does look grim 
if you happen to be wearing last 
night's dress. Don't be embarrassed 
by my presence, though. You couldn't 
have found anybody more sympathetic 
to your condition. I remember once 
in Petrograd when I felt exactly as 
you do. I had to bow from a balcony 
to the crowd. My dear, the masses 
have no understanding of the feelings 
of a lady before noon. Don't you 
find that true?

During Swana's speech Ninotchka has found herself completely.

NINOTCHKA
I think we can cut your visit short. 
Leon is not here.

SWANA
Of course not, my dear! I didn't 
come here with any such suspicion. 
How ridiculous!
(with a glance toward 
the living room)
Nor did I come here to pick up his 
hat.

CLOSE SHOT -- LEON'S HAT, shot through the bedroom door into 
the living room where it lies on the table.

LONG SHOT -- LIVING ROOM -- TOWARD BEDROOM DOOR

By the bed stand Ninotchka and Swana. Swana starts toward 
the living room, Ninotchka following her.

SWANA
(as she reaches the 
threshold)
How stale last night's gaiety looks! 
It has the taste of a dead cigarette.

NINOTCHKA
If you were encouraged to come here 
by our meeting last night I am afraid 
you misunderstood my attitude.

SWANA
Don't worry, you were quite rude 
enough.
(during the following 
speech, she draws 
the curtains and 
opens the windows)
Do you mind if I let in a little 
fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it 
will make you feel better and I want 
you to be at your very best. In full 
possession of your faculties, at 
least.

NINOTCHKA
(regaining her usual 
firmness)
Please come to the point. What is it 
you want?

SWANA
I just dropped in to have a little 
heart-to-heart talk with you.

NINOTCHKA
We have nothing to discuss.

SWANA
Now there you are completely wrong. 
If we sit down for a little chat, 
I'm sure we won't run out of 
conversation and what's more it won't 
be dull.

NINOTCHKA
Madame, what is it you people always 
say, regardless of what you mean... 
"I am delighted to have you here"? I 
have not reached that stage of 
civilization.

SWANA
That's all right... I grow on people.

NINOTCHKA
I must ask you to leave.

SWANA
Leave? That's exactly what I came 
here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't 
mean this hotel and I don't mean 
Paris... I mean France. There's a 
plane for Moscow at five-forty.

NINOTCHKA
(puzzled)
Madame, if you...

SWANA
Don't worry. I have already made 
reservations. It's perfect flying 
weather. They assure me there's a 
fine tail wind which will sweep you 
back to Moscow in no time.

NINOTCHKA
(still not 
understanding)
If this is meant to be a joke it is 
not funny. Or do you still think 
you're issuing orders from your palace 
in Petrograd?

Ninotchka's words for the first time sting Swana out of her 
apparently superficial attitude.

SWANA
(bitterly)
My palace in Petrograd... yes, you 
took that away from me. You took 
away my czar, my country, my people, 
everything I had...
(with emphasis)
but nothing more -- I warn you.

NINOTCHKA
(simply)
People cannot be taken away, madame, 
neither a hundred and sixty million 
nor one. Not if you have their love. 
You hadn't. That's why you're not in 
Russia any longer, and that's why 
you came here this morning.

SWANA
Very interesting, my dear, but 
couldn't you write all that from 
Moscow? A dissertation on love on 
Soviet stationery -- would be an 
amusing paradox.

NINOTCHKA
It is not enough to be witty, madame. 
People grow tired of being 
entertained. You made that mistake 
before. Problems were never solved 
by bowing from a balcony.

SWANA
My dear, you don't know how impressive 
I could be. Did you ever see me in 
my regalia with my diadem and all my 
jewels?

The word diadem startles Ninotchka. She starts to remember 
the night before, and she looks toward the safe.

INSERT OF THE DOOR OF THE SAFE, which is closed by now.

CLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA AND SWANA

Ninotchka stares in the direction of the safe as Swana 
chatters on.

SWANA
You can't deny we gave the people 
their money's worth -- almost -- 
eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!

NINOTCHKA
(desperately)
I must insist that you leave.

SWANA
Not before you agree to use those 
reservations to Moscow.

NINOTCHKA
In that case I can only say good-by.

Abruptly she walks toward the bedroom.

TRAVELING SHOT OF NINOTCHKA

She enters the small room connecting the living room and 
bedroom and closes the door to the living room. She walks 
into the bedroom toward the bed and glances at it. The diadem 
is not there. After going back into the anteroom, she opens 
the outer door of the safe and pulls on the inner door. It 
has not been properly closed and opens at once. The safe is 
empty. Ninotchka stands staring in frozen horror for a moment, 
then rushes to the telephone by the bed.

NINOTCHKA
(into the telephone)
lyse 2763.

LONG SHOT -- NINOTCHKA AT THE TELEPHONE, waiting for her 
connection

In the background the door to the living room is opened by 
Swana.

SWANA
(standing in the door)
I wouldn't waken Leon. After last 
night I would say not before three 
o'clock at the earliest.

NINOTCHKA
I told you to go, madame.

SWANA
Believe me, Leon can't help you. He 
doesn't know anything about the 
jewels... I give you my word... I 
swear it.

Ninotchka hangs up the receiver and stares at Swana. She 
walks toward her.

LIVING ROOM, SHOOTING INTO THE BEDROOM. In the foreground 
Swana, in the background Ninotchka, who is hurrying toward 
her.

NINOTCHKA
Where are they?

SWANA
You were very careless with our 
precious jewels, my dear. They're 
too expensive a toy for two children 
to play with.

NINOTCHKA
Where are they?

SWANA
Don't worry. Fortunately last night 
a very trustworthy friend kept his 
eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped 
his function as a waiter but he 
fulfilled his duty as a Russian.
(she draws back the 
fur scarf she is 
wearing, revealing a 
diamond star, one of 
the jewels we have 
seen)
I just put this on for sentiment. 
The rest are absolutely safe. I assure 
you. But if you feel like notifying 
the police...

NINOTCHKA
You leave me no choice.

SWANA
Won't it be rather embarrassing for 
a Soviet Envoy to disclose the 
circumstances under which she lost 
them?

NINOTCHKA
I will have to face the consequences, 
but so will you. Don't forget they 
will ask how you got them.

SWANA
That's very simple to answer. They 
were given to me by my mother. They 
were given to her by her mother, in 
fact they're mine, you cannot steal 
what belongs to you!

She proceeds into the living room, followed by Ninotchka.

NINOTCHKA
They always belonged to the Russian 
people. They were paid for with their 
sweat, their blood, their lives and 
you will give them back!

SWANA
(triumphantly)
I told you we had plenty to talk 
about. Shall we sit down?

They both sit.

SWANA
(very matter-of-fact)
Now, let's free ourselves from 
emotionalism and try to solve the 
problem in a practical way. Our 
situation has changed considerably. 
Before I had only a claim to the 
jewels. Now I have the jewels.

NINOTCHKA
In other words moral ideas have no 
weight with you... all right, then 
let's deal with legal facts. You 
know that France has recognized the 
Soviet.

SWANA
Unfortunately.

NINOTCHKA
Under Soviet law the jewels belong 
to the State. France is going to 
uphold that ownership.

SWANA
My lawyer agrees with you. He says 
France will uphold it in every court, 
but I will drag you through every 
court, don't forget that. And when I 
say it will take two years I am, as 
always, conservative.

NINOTCHKA
Won't those two years in court be 
expensive for you? I know that money 
was no object as long as you could 
squeeze it from the pockets of the 
people, but now...

SWANA
I may run out of money, but you have 
already run out of bread. Two years 
is a long time for your comrades to 
wait.

NINOTCHKA
I see. You have calculated in terms 
of hunger.

SWANA
No, I just wanted to be absolutely 
impartial. Both of us are faced with 
two rather uncomfortable years. We 
can condense these two years to two 
minutes if you want to accept my 
proposition. Ninotchka now realizes 
what she is after.

NINOTCHKA
Go on.

SWANA
I am willing to hand over the jewels 
and sign the necessary papers if you 
take that five-forty plane to Moscow.

NINOTCHKA
(quietly)
That's not the way to win him back... 
not Leon.

SWANA
I think I know Leon quite as well as 
you... possibly a little better. 
Leave that worry to me. Five-forty 
leaves you time enough to close the 
deal with Monsieur Mercier, but 
naturally you'll be too busy for any 
farewells. I'll see to it that 
everything is done in the most 
expeditious manner and I will also 
see you to the airport. That's my 
proposition, Comrade Yakushova.

Ninotchka knows herself to be faced with an inevitable 
decision. For a moment she cannot answer. The telephone rings. 
Ninotchka takes the receiver.

NINOTCHKA
(into telephone)
Yes...
(it is Leon)
Oh hello...

Much as she wants to talk to him she hesitates in the presence 
of Swana. Swana realizes the situation, gets up, and walks 
over to the window, where she stands looking out.

CLOSE-UP -- NINOTCHKA AT TELEPHONE

NINOTCHKA
Good morning, Leon...
(forcing herself to 
be gay so that he 
will not suspect 
anything)
... no, you didn't waken me... I am 
fine, thank you.... Yes, it was... 
marvelous.... What?... for luncheon? 
I'm afraid I can't. I am going to be 
very busy...
(looking for excuses)
well, I have a lot of things to attend 
to today.... What?... Well to tell 
you the truth I am a little tired 
and I would like to rest...
(she forces herself 
to laugh)
you may be right... perhaps it is 
the champagne.... For dinner?... Of 
course... seven o'clock here?...
(realizing that she 
will be gone by then)
seven o'clock is all right.... 
Where?... That will be lovely.... 
Yes...
(there is a knock on 
the door)
Come in.
(into the telephone)
Yes?...
(looking toward the 
door she sees 
something which makes 
her stop the 
conversation)
Just a moment...
(she puts the receiver 
on the table and 
walks toward the 
door)

ANTEROOM BETWEEN LIVING ROOM AND CORRIDOR, shooting toward 
the living room. In the background we see Swana standing at 
the window. Ninotchka comes into the anteroom, closes the 
door in order to shut off Swana's view. Camera pans with 
Ninotchka as she walks toward the hall door where the bellboy 
is putting down a big flower basket.

NINOTCHKA
(to bellboy)
You can leave it here.

The bellboy exits. Ninotchka looks at the basket of flowers 
for a moment, then takes the envelope which is attached to 
the handle. She opens it and reads the enclosed letter. It 
must be a love note, for her eyes grow wet. She turns to the 
last page.

INSERT

"...and sweetheart, I have kept my first promise. I sent 
poor old Gaston to the market this morning and if you will 
look deep into the flowers you will see what I got for 
him...."

CLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA

She puts her hand in the basket and takes out a bottle of 
milk.

INSERT OF THE BOTTLE

On the label we see a picture of a goat.

NINOTCHKA

She smiles sadly and goes to the telephone, which is on the 
console in the anteroom.

NINOTCHKA
(into telephone)
Operator, will you switch the call 
please?... Hello?... Darling, your 
present just arrived.... It's very 
silly and very wonderful... thank 
you... No, I won't forget... seven 
o'clock....
(with great tenderness)
Good-by, my darling.... What?... 
Oh...
(softly)
salute!

She puts down the receiver. Camera pans with her as she goes 
to the door of the living room. She opens the door and goes 
in. Swana turns from the window.

NINOTCHKA
I am sorry to have kept you waiting, 
madame.

SWANA -- AT THE AIRPORT

DISSOLVE TO:

shooting from a HIGH ANGLE. We hear the SOUND of an airplane 
just taking off. Camera pulls back so that Swana seems to be 
photographed from the airplane. Finally the SHOT discloses 
the whole airport and Swana disappearing into the crowd.

ENTRANCE HALL -- SWANA'S APARTMENT

Swana's maid is opening the door for Swana, who enters in 
the highest spirits.

SWANA
Good afternoon, Jacqueline.

MAID
Good afternoon, Your Highness.
(hesitantly)
Madame, I...

SWANA
You didn't find my glove. All right, 
you're forgiven.

MAID
Thank you, Your Highness. Count 
d'Algout is waiting. He's been here 
some time.

Swana inspects herself briefly in the hall mirror, proceeds 
into the living room.

LIVING ROOM -- SWANA'S APARTMENT

Leon is pacing up and down. Swana enters.

SWANA
Leon, darling, how nice! Have you 
ordered tea or a cocktail?

LEON
No thanks, Swana.

SWANA
Did I act stupidly last night? Should 
I apologize?

LEON
I'm the one who should apologize. I 
should have talked to you before.

SWANA
Is this, by any chance, going to be 
a confession?

LEON
Yes.

SWANA
Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. 
Have you forgotten our First 
Commandment: Never Complain -- Never 
Explain. It has worked so often and 
so perfectly, don't let's break the 
rule. And please don't look so guilty, 
otherwise I'll...

LEON
This time, Swana -- just this once -- 
I must ask you to listen.

SWANA
All right, I'll listen.

LEON
I know you hate the obvious but do 
you mind if, at this moment, I'm not 
in the least subtle?

SWANA
Brutal frankness, if you insist.

LEON
There are a hundred ways to approach 
it, but I feel it can best be said 
in one simple phrase. I'm in love, 
Swana.

SWANA
And I thought it was something 
serious! How could you frighten me 
so?

LEON
It must be serious, Swana. Not long 
ago I'd have considered such a 
statement rather juvenile and rather 
middle class. Now I can say it without 
stammering, without a blush. I'm in 
love, Swana.

SWANA
Say it over and over again, Leon. 
Words are a wonderful safety valve, 
and that's what you need -- because 
you know it's impossible, don't you?

LEON
I have to be simple again, Swana, 
and you may find it shockingly banal. 
I've thought it over and I'm willing 
to take all the consequences, even 
if it means a complete readjustment 
of my way of living.

SWANA
Leon! This has the ugly sound of 
regeneration.

LEON
I'm afraid that's what it is.

SWANA
The same old trouble, Leon. You're 
always late. Whether you're taking 
me to the Opera or calling for me at 
a beauty shop, you're never on time. 
And now, when it's a question of 
your reform -- late again.
(she glances at her 
wrist watch)
By about five minutes.

LEON
What is this, Swana?

SWANA
Knowing the efficiency of the French 
Air Service I think I can guarantee 
that Madame Yakushova has already 
taken off for Moscow.

LEON
Has done what?

SWANA
She's gone, Leon.

LEON
Do you expect me to believe that?

Swana picks up the receiver of the telephone and holds it 
out to him.

SWANA
Here's the telephone. If you call 
the hotel you will find that you 
have no seven o'clock appointment.

THE MOSCOW PLANE

It is flying past the Eiffel Tower.

CLOSE SHOT -- AIRPLANE WINDOW

Behind the window we see Ninotchka looking at Paris for the 
last time. Camera moves over to the next window and we see 
Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski also giving Paris a sad 
farewell look.

ANOTHER VIEW OF PARIS, from the air. The mist has closed in 
by now so that only the top of the Eiffel Tower is visible 
above it.

CLOSE-UP -- NINOTCHKA, looking down on the Tower

INTERIOR, Airplane -- Ninotchka, Buljanoff, Iranoff, and 
Kopalski

Ninotchka turns from the window and leans against the back 
of her chair. The Russians follow her example. There is a 
moment of silence and sadness.

BULJANOFF
Imagine, for once in our lives we 
were in Paris and we never went to 
the Eiffel Tower.

KOPALSKI
That's right.

IRANOFF
They tell me it has a wonderful 
restaurant on the second floor.

KOPALSKI
While you eat, you look at the view.

CLOSE-UP -- NINOTCHKA

She is trying to overcome all sentimentality, but as the 
following speech progresses she cannot escape the personal 
implication involved.

NINOTCHKA
Yes, it is an amazing piece of 
engineering. Still the most remarkable 
iron structure in the world. Leading 
to the top there is a staircase of 
over a thousand steps... but an 
elevator is included in the price of 
admission.

FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

INSERT OF A PARIS NEWSPAPER

HERALD DU MATIN

Camera zooms down on a headline of an article.

Mercier buys priceless russian jewels. Russian commission 
has left for moscow.

STREET IN PARIS -- MORNING

Camera follows Leon as he walks excitedly and nervously along 
the boulevard. He turns into a Russian Intouriste Bureau, 
one of the travel bureaus maintained by the Soviet government 
in foreign countries to supply information regarding travel, 
give visas, etc.

INTOURISTE BUREAU

It is a typical travel bureau. Behind the counter are 
attendants and some people getting information and pamphlets. 
Leon enters, looks around, and sees a door which says "Visas 
and Passport Department." He enters.

INTERIOR, VISA ROOM

It is a room smaller than the previous one. Behind the counter 
stands a typical Bolshevik Official. In front of the counter 
is an elderly English lady. Leon takes his place behind her, 
nervous at having to wait. The Official stamps the English 
lady's passport and hands it to her.

OFFICIAL
Well, everything is in order. I hope 
you will enjoy your trip to Russia, 
madame.

ENGLISH LADY
Thank you. Oh, by the way, I've heard 
so many rumors about laundry 
conditions in Russia. Is it advisable 
to take one's own towels?

OFFICIAL
Certainly not, madame. That's only 
capitalistic propaganda. We change 
the towel every week.

ENGLISH LADY
Oh... thank you.

She leaves. Leon moves up to the Official.

OFFICIAL
Yes, please?

At this moment the telephone rings. The Official takes the 
receiver.

OFFICIAL
(into phone)
Yes... Comrade Cazabine? No, I'm 
sorry... he hasn't been with us for 
six months. He was called back to 
Russia and was investigated. You can 
get further details from his widow.

He hangs up the receiver. Leon, thinking of Ninotchka, is 
horrified by this statement.

LEON
Pardon me, I am very interested in 
what you just said -- you mean when 
an envoy goes back to Russia -- if 
they don't like what he has done 
they put him out of the way?

OFFICIAL
Not always... look at me... I've 
been back twice.
(he knocks on wood)

LEON
(his alarm growing)
Here's my passport.... Please give 
me a visa. I have to leave for Russia 
immediately.

OFFICIAL
(reading passport)
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a 
nobleman!

LEON
Don't hold that against me... please!

OFFICIAL
Why should an aristocrat want to go 
to Russia?

LEON
Business.

OFFICIAL
What business?

LEON
Private.

OFFICIAL
There is no privacy in Russia. This 
whole thing seems very suspicious. 
What's the real reason? If you ever 
want to get into Russia, take my 
advice... confess!

LEON
(dismayed)
Confess what?

OFFICIAL
Are you sympathetic to the former 
Czaristic government -- the White 
Russians?

LEON
On the contrary -- I don't want to 
have anything to do with them.

OFFICIAL
You believe in our cause?

Leon, feeling that he has to go to the rescue of his girl, 
whips up an enormous enthusiasm for the cause.

LEON
Oh... I think it's great! Everyone 
works -- everyone contributes -- 
that's what I want to do -- work! I 
make my own bed -- you can call up 
my butler! I don't believe in the 
right of the individual. I like the 
Bolshevik ideal -- everyone being 
the same. You just like me -- me 
just like you -- I use your comb -- 
you use my toothbrush -- oh, it's a 
great life.... Please... give me 
that visa!

At this moment Swana enters.

SWANA
Hello, Leon darling!

LEON
(startled)
Hello.

SWANA
(suavely) After our talk last night 
I took it for granted that you would 
drop in here this morning. Knowing 
how difficult it is to get into Soviet 
Russia, I thought I might be of some 
assistance to you.
(to the Official)
May I introduce myself? I am the 
Duchess Swana of Russia... another 
Russia.

The Official gasps in surprise.

LEON
Now, please, Swana.

SWANA
(to the Official)
Count d'Algout was for several years 
my personal representative and if it 
is necessary to sign any affidavit 
for him I'll be delighted.

LEON
(bitterly)
That does it, Swana.
(he leads her toward 
the door)
Now you mustn't miss your appointment 
with your hair-dresser.

SWANA
(stopping at the door)
Just in case they don't give you 
your visa to Russia I want you to 
know that I have signed a contract 
for my memoirs and rented a lovely 
little chteau in the Touraine, and 
if you feel the need of a change...

LEON
Thank you, Swana. You are very 
gracious.

His words are unmistakably a final dismissal. She walks out. 
Leon looks after her for a second, then goes back to the 
Official. He tries to laugh off the incident.

LEON
She must have her little joke.
(the Official responds 
with a stony look)
You're not going to take that 
seriously.

OFFICIAL
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in 
the White Russian movement?

LEON
Believe me, I have no connection 
with her any longer... I swear I 
haven't!

OFFICIAL
But you had!

LEON
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank 
with you. I have no business in 
Moscow.

OFFICIAL
I think so too.

LEON
I want to see a friend of mine... a 
very dear friend.... It's a personal 
matter which has nothing to do with 
politics or social philosophies.... 
It's a girl.

OFFICIAL
So it's love which drags you to 
Moscow.

LEON
Yes!

OFFICIAL
No visa.

LEON
(fighting for his 
point)
I must get into that country of yours!

OFFICIAL
Oh no. No visa.

LEON
(more aggressively)
That's impossible! Nobody has the 
right.... You can't do that!... If 
you don't give me that visa...

OFFICIAL
(ironically)
You're going to force us... huh?

LEON
(growing violent)
Now look here... you advertise all 
over the world that you want people 
to go into your country and when 
someone tries to get in, you keep 
him out!

OFFICIAL
Why should I take a chance?

LEON
On what?

OFFICIAL
How do I know you don't want to blow 
up a factory?

LEON
What for... why?

OFFICIAL
Or a tunnel or a bridge...

LEON
Suspicions... nothing but 
suspicions!... That's the trouble 
with you! If you don't let me in 
I'll stand in front of this office 
of yours and warn people to keep 
away from Russia!... I'll picket 
your whole country....

The Official laughs in a superior way.

LEON
I'll boycott you, that's what I'm 
going to do!... No more vodka... no 
more caviar... no more Tchaikovsky... 
no more borscht.... Wait a minute, I 
know something better than that...

The Official leans forward sarcastically.

OFFICIAL
What?

With a knock-out blow, Leon sends him to the floor, then, 
leaning over the counter, he shouts.

LEON
And you can tell the Kremlin that's 
just the beginning!

He strides out.

The Official's head emerges from the counter. As he adjusts 
his bruised jaw, he speaks.

OFFICIAL
No visa.

Establishing Shot of Russia -- First of May -- Stock Shot of 
May Day Parade on the Red Square

FADE IN ON:

DISSOLVE TO:

RADIO ANNOUNCER

RADIO ANNOUNCER
March, march, march! Comrades of the 
World, never has there been such a 
May Day parade as this! Already for 
four hours the pavements of Moscow 
have resounded to the tread of a 
million boots! Thousands of gun-
carriages have thundered past. 
Thousands of tanks, combined with 
our mighty air force, have 
demonstrated to a belligerent neighbor 
that we are ready and invincible! 
Now past me marches the great army 
of our civilians! Men and women of 
all ages. All servants of the State 
united in one thought and ideal. 
Group of Several Units Marching

Workmen, soldiers, tanks, airplanes, etc.

DISSOLVE TO:

Column of Women, dressed in typical Russian May Day parade 
fashion, marching and saluting. The CAMERA NARROWS DOWN to a 
CLOSE SHOT OF Ninotchka marching with the others. All her 
individuality is gone. She is one of many, a cog in the 
Russian machine. With a stern expression she is looking 
straight ahead when suddenly something attracts her attention 
and she glances to one side.

A Column of Male Workers is coming in the opposite direction. 
Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski are recognizable among them.

CLOSE SHOT -- BULJANOFF, IRANOFF, AND KOPALSKI MARCHING. All 
three are already pretty exhausted from the long march. 
Kopalski sees Ninotchka. He whispers it to the others. The 
three look toward Ninotchka and lift their shoulders with a 
gesture which says, "Look where we are now."

CLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA, answering them with a sad smile. 
After they have passed she stares straight forward again 
with the same stern expression.

DISSOLVE TO:

PANNING SHOT -- STAIRCASE IN NINOTCHKA'S TENEMENT HOUSE

It is an overcrowded house. People are walking up and down 
stairs, standing grouped in front of the various apartments; 
children are sliding down the banisters and playing games 
under the feet of the adults.

Ninotchka trudges upstairs wearily. Camera pans with her as 
she goes into an apartment which is divided into several sub-
apartments. Finally she opens the door of her own room and 
goes in.

NINOTCHKA'S ROOM

It is a comparatively small room, which she shares with two 
other girls. As she enters only one girl is present. It is 
Anna, a cello player, who sits on the edge of her bed 
practicing on her cello. Apparently Ninotchka has not adjusted 
herself completely to the Moscow which she once thought so 
great.

NINOTCHKA
Good evening, Anna.

ANNA
Good evening, Ninotchka.

NINOTCHKA
Aren't you late?

ANNA
No, the opera starts an hour later 
tonight on account of the parade.

During the following scene Anna puts her cello in its case 
and gets ready to go to her job. Ninotchka starts to arrange 
the table in the center of the floor for a party of four. 
Out of her cupboard she takes very primitive-looking dishes, 
a flower pot, glasses, and a kind of shawl which serves as a 
tablecloth.

NINOTCHKA
Didn't you march?

Anna is apparently not a fanatical believer in the Bolshevik 
regime and takes a cynical and humorous attitude toward it.

ANNA
They didn't let me. I am in disgrace. 
Last week at the performance of Carmen 
I played a sour note. The conductor 
got so excited he yelled, "There's 
sabotage in the string section!"

NINOTCHKA
Too bad... you missed an inspiring 
day, Anna.

ANNA
I know... my heart is sad... but my 
feet are happy. When all the tanks 
and guns were roaring over the Red 
Square I sat here all by myself and 
played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad 
at all.
(she has noticed 
Ninotchka's 
preparations)
Are you expecting someone?

NINOTCHKA
A few friends... just a little dinner 
party.

ANNA
What are you serving?

NINOTCHKA
An omelet.

ANNA
(puzzled)
An omelet! Aren't you living a little 
above your ration?

NINOTCHKA
Well, I've saved up two eggs and 
each of my friends is bringing his 
own so we'll manage.

ANNA
It just goes to prove the theory of 
our State. If you stand alone it 
means a boiled egg but if you're 
true to the collective spirit and 
stick together you've got an omelet.
(devilishly)
That reminds me... have you heard 
the latest they're telling about the 
Kremlin?

At this moment a door to one of the adjoining rooms opens 
and Gurganov, a middle-aged man with a sour stool-pigeon 
expression, walks quietly through the room to another door, 
taking in the girls with one sly glance and giving the 
impression that not only his eyes but his ears are open. 
Anna breaks off her remark.

ANNA
(whispering)
I'll tell you later.
(after Gurganov has 
disappeared into the 
other room she 
continues)
That Gurganov, you never know whether 
he's on his way to the washroom or 
the Secret Police.

NINOTCHKA
You should be more careful, Anna.

ANNA
And you too, Ninotchka.

NINOTCHKA
(amazed)
About what?

ANNA
Ever since you have been back from 
Paris...

NINOTCHKA
I haven't talked to anyone about 
Paris. I haven't said a word.

ANNA
That's just it. It makes people feel 
queer. I dont' want you to get in 
any trouble.

NINOTCHKA
I have nothing to hide.

ANNA
You should. I'll show you.

She walks over to her cupboard and takes out a piece of 
lingerie and comes back to Ninotchka with it.

ANNA
When I passed through the laundry 
yard today I saw all the women huddled 
around this so I brought it up here. 
Things like this create a bad feeling. 
First they didn't know whose it was. 
Then they saw the Paris label and 
did it start a commotion! Some said 
it's what we all ought to wear and 
others said it's like hanging foreign 
ideas on our clothesline. It 
undermines our whole cause.

NINOTCHKA
(aware of the pettiness 
which surrounds her)
I see.

ANNA
You know how it is today... all you 
have to do is wear a pair of silk 
stockings and they suspect you of 
counter-revolution.

NINOTCHKA
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here 
when I wash it next. I should hate 
to see our country endangered by my 
underwear.

ANNA
(confidentially)
Ninotchka, you know I am your friend, 
you can trust me.... Did you bring 
back anything else?

Ninotchka suddenly is transported to Paris in her memory.

NINOTCHKA
(with feeling)
No, I left everything in Paris. I 
just happened to be wearing this.

ANNA
Tell me... what else did you have?

NINOTCHKA
(enjoying the thought)
Well, a hat...

ANNA
What was it like?

NINOTCHKA
It was very silly.... I would be 
ashamed to wear it here.

ANNA
As beautiful as that? What else? 
Come, tell me.

NINOTCHKA
An evening gown.

ANNA
(puzzled)
Evening gown?

NINOTCHKA
A dress you wear in the evening.

ANNA
What do you wear in the morning?

NINOTCHKA
When you get up you put on a negligee, 
and then you change to a morning 
frock.

ANNA
You mean to tell me you wear a 
different dress for different times 
of the day?

NINOTCHKA
Yes.

ANNA
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.

NINOTCHKA
No, my dear, it is true. That's how 
they live in the other world. Here 
we dress to have our bodies covered... 
to keep warm....

ANNA
And there?

NINOTCHKA
Well, sometimes they're not completely 
covered but... they don't freeze.

ANNA
(fingering the piece 
of lingerie)
They must have wonderful materials 
to make a thing like this so soft... 
something you don't even see.

NINOTCHKA
You feel it, though.

ANNA
(hesitantly)
Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up 
if we weren't such good friends.

NINOTCHKA
What is it, Anna?

ANNA
You know I told you that Pavlov and 
I are going to get married when he 
comes back from the maneuvers. Would 
it be asking too much...

NINOTCHKA
You want this?

ANNA
Just for the honeymoon.

NINOTCHKA
You can have it for good. It is my 
wedding present.

Anna is for a moment speechless over this generous gift. She 
embraces and kisses Ninotchka.

ANNA
Ninotchka! Ninotchka!

She kisses her again, takes her cello, and starts to leave.

ANNA
Am I going to play that cadenza 
tonight!

Anna exits, closing the door. Ninotchka is left alone. Her 
thoughts are still in the other world, obviously with Leon. 
Mechanically she looks over the table to see if everything 
is all right, then she walks over to the radio (a primitive 
little machine). As she turns the knob she smiles again 
reminiscently. As she does, the blare of a Russian speech 
brings her back to reality.

VOICE ON RADIO
Individuals? Yes, as atoms in the 
cosmos of Soviet Russia. Family? 
Yes. One great family of one hundred 
and sixty million, struggling, 
fighting, victorious Russian 
proletarians. Thus shall we pursue 
our way into the future, fists 
clenched, hearts encased in steel 
armed against bourgeois sentimentality 
and...

Quickly she turns the knob and again there is a burst of 
Russian oratory.

SECOND VOICE ON RADIO

...From the Exploiters for the Toilers. We are going full 
steam ahead through industrialization toward socialism. Let 
us put the Union of Socialistic Soviet Republics into an 
automobile and the muzhik into a tractor, and then let the 
capitalists try to keep up with us! The same thing happens 
for a third time.

THIRD VOICE ON RADIO

...and thirty million peasants, eighty-five per cent of the 
population owned three hundred forty-three million four 
hundred and sixty-nine thousand acres of land, sixty-five 
per cent of the total area. And one hundred and fifty thousand 
nobles possessed thirty-five per cent of the country's natural 
wealth!

Ninotchka turns off the radio. She closes her eyes for a 
moment and with a sad smile murmurs to herself.

NINOTCHKA
No music.

At this moment the door opens, and Buljanoff, Iranoff, and 
Kopalski enter. There follow warm greetings between Ninotchka 
and the Three Russians.

ALL THREE RUSSIANS
Ninotchka! Ninotchka!

A moment of silence follows. The four look at each other as 
people do who share a secret.

NINOTCHKA
(with great warmth)
How are you, you three scoundrels?

KOPALSKI
(wryly)
Well, we're back home.

BULJANOFF
(sourly)
You know what they say -- there's 
nothing like home.

IRANOFF
That's right... and we might as well 
face it.

NINOTCHKA
(trying not to say 
what she feels)
Come, now, you must not talk that 
way.... You have to adjust 
yourselves.... We must be brave.

IRANOFF
Brave... that's right.

BULJANOFF
Let's be happy that we're all alive.

IRANOFF
And that's something we owe to 
Ninotchka.

KOPALSKI
If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin 
such a wonderful report about us, 
who knows what would have happened?

BULJANOFF
I can tell you exactly.

NINOTCHKA
Now let's forget everything except 
that we're together.

BULJANOFF
That's right.

IRANOFF
Let's do that.

KOPALSKI
(falling in with her 
attempt)
It's a real Paris reunion.

IRANOFF
If you close your eyes and listen to 
our voices we might be in Paris.

NINOTCHKA
Let's not close our eyes. There are 
many good things to see here too.

BULJANOFF
(cynically)
I think I need my glasses.

KOPALSKI
(reprimanding him 
quietly)
A little more tact... look how nicely 
she's fixed the table -- all for us.

BULJANOFF
(in a loud voice, 
trying to make up 
for his faux pas)
How nicely you've fixed the table, 
Ninotchka.

IRANOFF
What a lovely room you have here.

BULJANOFF
How many families live here with 
you?

NINOTCHKA
Only myself and two other girls. One 
is a cello player in the opera and 
the other a street-car conductor.

IRANOFF
(impressed)
Just three people in a room this 
size? Whew!

KOPALSKI
(inspecting the room)
And your own gas cooker? That's 
marvelous!
(forgetting himself)
Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...

NINOTCHKA
Sssh! Once and for all, we're in 
Moscow!

KOPALSKI
(walking over to the 
window)
Yes, there's no doubt of that...
(sarcastically)
Just look out of the window and there 
it is.

NINOTCHKA
And it's great! Think what it was a 
few years ago and what it is now.

Iranoff and Buljanoff have joined them at the window.

IRANOFF
She's right...
(under his breath)
anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.

BULJANOFF
Just see how happy the people look... 
from here....

KOPALSKI
Can you blame them?... at least the 
May Day parade is over.

BULJANOFF
That's another thing... it's spring.

NINOTCHKA
The same spring we had in Paris. 
Just as good.

KOPALSKI
Even the swallows are back.

BULJANOFF AND IRANOFF
Yes, that's right.

IRANOFF
Maybe that's the same swallow we saw 
in Paris!

BULJANOFF
It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must 
have been in Paris! You can see it 
in his whole attitude! He just picked 
up a crumb of our black bread, shook 
his head, and dropped it.

KOPALSKI
If you asked him why he left France 
I bet he couldn't name one good 
reason.

BULJANOFF
I should be a swallow! Right now I 
would be sitting in front of the 
Caf de Paris picking up flakes of 
French pastry that would melt in my 
bill.

NINOTCHKA
Now, comrades... there is something 
better in life than crumbs of French 
pastry.

KOPALSKI
(the realist)
Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....

NINOTCHKA
We will get that... we'll get 
everything... maybe a little bit 
later but we'll get it... We must be 
patient... Finally we got the spring, 
didn't we? We got the swallows, and 
you will get your apfel strudel too.

BULJANOFF
(consolingly)
And if it is too late for you your 
children will eat it.

IRANOFF
(breaking the mood)
Let's forget the future... let's 
stop being sentimental... let's start 
that omelet.

KOPALSKI
That's right.
(he takes a little 
box out of his pocket)
Here's my egg.
(he hands it to 
Ninotchka)

Iranoff unties his egg from his handkerchief.

IRANOFF
And here's mine.

He hands it to Ninotchka.

Buljanoff reaches in his pocket and from his expression we 
see that a catastrophe must have happened.

BULJANOFF
Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.

NINOTCHKA
Don't worry... there will be enough.

IRANOFF
Come, Ninotchka, let's make it in 
real Parisian style!

The group all go to the gas cooker and Ninotchka starts to 
make the omelet. The others stand around as though they were 
watching a great event.

KOPALSKI
Let's fill it with confitures, des 
prunes...

BULJANOFF
...des raisins de Madre, des 
framboises...
(...with grapes of 
Madeira, with 
raspberries...)

IRANOFF
...des petites fraises des bois... 
de la crme de Bretagne...
(...with small wild 
strawberries... with 
cream...)

KOPALSKI
...so it blows up that big... what 
they call an Omelette Surprise!

BULJANOFF
And the surprise is there's nothing 
in it.

KOPALSKI
I know, but if we can't put in all 
these wonderful things at least let's 
put in some imagination.
(he raises his voice)
In that one omelet we'll taste the 
whole of Paris!

The door through which Gurganov disappeared opens and Gurganov 
comes out.

IRANOFF
(seeing him)
Sssh!

The conversation stops. Gurganov walks quietly through the 
room, again observing everything. He goes out at last.

IRANOFF
A man like that... all he has to do 
is to walk through a room and the 
omelet drops.

There is a dead silence. All are again aware of the reality 
which surrounds. They concentrate quietly on the frying pan.

DISSOLVE TO:

INSERT OF THE FRYING PAN

The eggs are gradually taking the shape of an omelet.

DISSOLVE TO:

INSERT OF A PLATE ON THE TABLE

Only the last scraps of the omelet are on it. Buljanoff's 
hand comes in with a big piece of bread with which he sops 
up every fragment that is left.

DISSOLVE TO:

MEDIUM SHOT -- NINOTCHKA'S ROOM -- EVENING

The curtains are drawn and the lamp lighted. All four are 
sitting around the table, in the center of which is a samovar. 
In front of each of them is a glass of tea. One of the 
Russians is playing a balalaika and all are singing gaily, 
"Paris."

Ninotchka is enjoying their companionship. After a little 
while the door to the corridor opens and Ninotchka's other 
roommate, the street-car conductor, strides in. She is a 
squareset, unfriendly woman in uniform.

At sight of her one of the Russians nudges Ninotchka, makes 
the gesture of ringing up a fare, and accompanies it with an 
inquiring look. Ninotchka nods. The Russians change their 
tune quickly to the "Volga Boatman" in order not to awaken 
animosity.

The street-car conductor goes to her bed and starts to take 
off her shoes and her coat, then draws the curtain. During 
the following scene we hear the splash of water and the sound 
of gargling.

Again Gurganov crosses the room, this time accompanied by 
his little son.

Suddenly the door is opened by Vladimir, a friendly old man.

VLADIMIR
(calling into the 
room)
Comrade Yakushova, here, the postman 
left a letter for you.

He hands her a letter and exits.

CLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA

She takes the letter, glances at the envelope, and is stunned. 
She turns the envelope -- an expression of breathless wonder 
comes over her face.

ALL THREE RUSSIANS
What is it, Ninotchka?

NINOTCHKA
It's from Paris.

IRANOFF AND BULJANOFF
From Paris?

KOPALSKI
A bill?

NINOTCHKA
From Leon.

ALL THREE RUSSIANS
From Leon!... How is he?... Come, 
tell us... open it... tell us... how 
is he?

Ninotchka sits in the chair nearest the lamp. All three are 
looking over her shoulder. Ninotchka hesitates to open the 
letter, obviously wanting to read it all by herself. Realizing 
her feelings, the Three Russians walk to the far end of the 
room and sit down on a little bench, looking toward Ninotchka 
with childlike expectancy. In great anticipation Ninotchka 
opens the letter. She starts to read it. Suddenly her 
expression changes to one of terrific disappointment. She 
turns the letter over, glances at the second page, then puts 
the letter down on the table. The Russians have followed her 
expression closely. Slowly they walk over to her.

IRANOFF
(very sympathetic)
Bad news?

NINOTCHKA
Look for yourselves.

Iranoff picks up the letter. All three look at it.

Insert of First Page of Letter, held in Iranoff's hand. In 
Leon's handwriting we read:

"Ninotchka, my darling,"

The rest of the writing is blocked out, line by line, and 
across the page is a big stamp which says "Censored." 
Iranoff's hand turns the page. The second page is also 
censored except for the final words,

"Yours, Leon."

SHOT OF THE WHOLE GROUP

Iranoff puts the letter back on the table. They all understand 
and realize that Ninotchka wants to be alone.

KOPALSKI
Well, I think it's getting late. 
Good night, Ninotchka.

IRANOFF
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.

Ninotchka rises and shakes their hands.

NINOTCHKA
(with great warmth)
Good night, my friends.

The three start to leave but Buljanoff returns and whispers 
to Ninotchka.

BULJANOFF
They can't censor our memories, can 
they?

Ninotchka presses his hand. He walks quietly out with the 
others.

Ninotchka, left alone, sits down. She is heartbroken. Her 
thoughts are too sad and too far away to be disturbed by the 
snoring which comes from the corner where the street-car 
conductor has gone to bed.

shooting from the inside. Through the window the background 
of Moscow. It is winter and snow is on the roofs. The CAMERA 
PULLS BACK and discloses Razinin sitting at his desk, reading 
a report with a stern expression.

MEDIUM SHOT -- RAZININ'S OFFICE

Ninotchka enters carrying several folders. She walks to 
Razinin's desk and stands waiting for him to recognize her 
presence. She is a tired, stern girl. Razinin looks up.

RAZININ
Good morning, Comrade.

NINOTCHKA
(very businesslike)
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. 
Here is my report on the materials 
available for trading in the next 
four months.

RAZININ
Does this include the products of 
the Far Eastern provinces?

NINOTCHKA
Yes, it does.

RAZININ
You mean you have finished the whole 
investigation?

NINOTCHKA
Yes.

RAZININ
That's marvelous.... You must have 
worked day and night.... Don't you 
ever sleep?

NINOTCHKA
I need very little sleep. We must be 
extremely careful what goods we take 
in exchange. I have already started 
a survey of our most urgent needs.

RAZININ
Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will 
have to turn over that work to someone 
else.

NINOTCHKA
(startled)
May I ask why?

RAZININ
Please... sit down.

Ninotchka sits.

RAZININ
Cigarette?

NINOTCHKA
Thank you.

RAZININ
Well, Comrade, have you heard from 
your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, 
and Iranoff?

NINOTCHKA
No.

RAZININ
I haven't either, but I've heard 
about them. You must realize it was 
only on the strength of your Paris 
report that I sent them to 
Constantinople; without that I never 
would have trusted them on a mission 
as important as the fur deal.

NINOTCHKA
May I ask what has happened?

RAZININ
As soon as our representatives go to 
a foreign country they seem to lose 
all sense of balance. If I told you 
what's going on in Constantinople 
right now you wouldn't believe it. 
Those three have been sitting there 
for six weeks and haven't sold a 
piece of fur.
(he points to the 
folder)
This anonymous report was sent me. 
They are dragging the good name of 
our country through every caf and 
night club. Here...
(he reads from the 
report)
"How can the Bolshevik cause gain 
respect among the Moslems if your 
three representatives, Buljanoff, 
Iranoff, and Kopalski, get so drunk 
that they throw a carpet out of their 
hotel window and complain to the 
management that it didn't fly?"

Ninotchka has to suppress a smile of amusement at the antics 
of her three old friends.

NINOTCHKA
Oh, they shouldn't do such things. 
Are you sure this report is correct?

RAZININ
It gives details which couldn't be 
invented. Naturally I want to verify 
it and that's why I need you.

NINOTCHKA
(apprehensively)
You want me to go to Constantinople?

RAZININ
Yes... leaving immediately.

NINOTCHKA
(her one object to 
escape the mission)
I appreciate the confidence you show 
in me, but I must ask you to entrust 
someone else with this mission. I 
should hate to interrupt my present 
work. I am positive that my survey 
is more important than finding out 
whether three of our comrades have 
been drinking some extra glasses of 
champagne.

RAZININ
(austerely)
That is for me to decide, Comrade 
Yakushova.

NINOTCHKA
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep 
my position -- but please... don't 
send me.

RAZININ
I don't understand.

NINOTCHKA
(making a last effort)
How can I make myself clear... It is 
difficult to express but I'd rather 
not go to foreign countries any more. 
Please, Comrade... let me stay here... 
let me finish my work... I am in the 
rhythm of it now... I don't want to 
go away. I don't want to be sent 
into that foreign atmosphere again. 
It throws one out of gear.... Let me 
finish my work... I have concentrated 
everything in it... Please... don't 
make me go.

RAZININ
Please don't waste my time, Comrade. 
Do your duty. Good-by.

NINOTCHKA
I will do my best.

She exits, as we

DISSOLVE TO:

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF CONSTANTINOPLE, on a bright sunlit day, 
if possible with the circling shadow of an airplane.

DISSOLVE TO:

LONG SHOT -- AIRPORT IN CONSTANTINOPLE, shooting from an 
airplane angle. A crowd is awaiting the arrival of a plane. 
The CAMERA goes down to a CLOSE SHOT of Buljanoff, Iranoff, 
and Kopalski, standing in the crowd.

All three are very elegantly and gaily dressed. They are in 
the happiest mood. One of them carries a large bouquet of 
flowers to greet Ninotchka.

DISSOLVE TO:

LIVING ROOM OF A VERY LUXURIOUS HOTEL SUITE IN CONSTANTINOPLE. 
Its style should suggest the locale. Ninotchka enters with 
the Three Russians, who are very happy to have her with them 
again.

KOPALSKI
(indicating the room)
How do you like it, Ninotchka? Isn't 
it wonderful?

IRANOFF AND BULJANOFF
Tell us... tell us.

Ninotchka protests, but during the whole scene it is evident 
that behind her protestations there is none of the force and 
conviction she displayed in a similar situation in the Royal 
Suite.

NINOTCHKA
But Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski...

IRANOFF
Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start 
figuring it out in cows.

NINOTCHKA
You've done it again and I am 
responsible. How can you forget 
yourselves this way? You were sent 
here to make money, not to spend it.

IRANOFF
Buljanoff, she still has those old-
fashioned Bolshevik ideas.

BULJANOFF
It is high time you got out of Russia.

NINOTCHKA
(not knowing what to 
do with the three 
rascals)
I must be stern with you.

KOPALSKI
(delighted)
That's our old Ninotchka!

BULJANOFF AND IRANOFF
(agreeing with him)
Yes, yes.

NINOTCHKA
Don't forget, the day will come when 
you will have to face Razinin.

BULJANOFF
(cockily)
Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? 
How does he manage?

NINOTCHKA
But, Comrades...

KOPALSKI
(with the happiness 
of being free again 
in his voice)
We are not comrades any more... we 
are friends, Ninotchka.

BULJANOFF
Imagine, we don't have to whisper 
any longer.

IRANOFF
We can say whatever we want. We can 
shout... we can complain... Look...
(he opens the door 
leading to corridor)
The service in this hotel is terrible!
(he closes the door)
See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any 
attention. That's freedom.

BULJANOFF
(dryly)
No, that's bad management.

NINOTCHKA
Is it possible to bring you back to 
reality for a moment? I must have a 
complete report of your negotiations 
and a detailed expense account.

BULJANOFF
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There 
is a Turkish proverb which says, "If 
something smells bad, why put your 
nose in it?"

NINOTCHKA
And there is a Russian saying: "The 
cat who has cream on his whiskers 
had better find good excuses."

BULJANOFF
With our cream situation what it is, 
it is Russia which should apologize 
to the cats.

NINOTCHKA
(helplessly)
Friends... friends, Buljanoff, 
Iranoff...

KOPALSKI
(afraid of being left 
out)
...and Kopalski.

NINOTCHKA
(pleadingly)
Don't make it difficult for me. This 
is no more a pleasure trip for me 
than it is for you.

IRANOFF
That was our idea when we first came. 
All we thought we would get out of 
this trip was a Turkish bath, but... 
we learned better.

KOPALSKI
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, 
the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...

IRANOFF
...Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves... 
into one single hour you can crowd a 
thousand and one nights.

BULJANOFF
All you have to do is say "open 
sesame."

NINOTCHKA
I don't know how I can get you out 
of it this time. How will it end? 
What will happen to you?

BULJANOFF
(intimately)
Shall we tell her?

IRANOFF AND KOPALSKI
Yes.

BULJANOFF
(proudly)
Ninotchka, I hope you'll be our guest.

NINOTCHKA
Guest?

BULJANOFF
We have opened a restaurant...

IRANOFF
...we have a wonderful electric sign: 
"Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and 
Kopalski."

NINOTCHKA
You mean you are deserting Russia?

KOPALSKI
(singing the song of 
freedom)
Don't call it desertion. Our little 
restaurant... that is our Russia... 
the Russia of borscht, the Russia of 
beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour 
cream...

IRANOFF
...the Russia of piroshki... people 
will eat and love it.

BULJANOFF
We are not only serving good food, 
we are serving our country... we are 
making friends.

NINOTCHKA
(completely bewildered)
Who gave you this idea? What is 
responsible for all this?

KOPALSKI
(with a gleam in his 
eye)
There's something in Constantinople... 
something irresistible....

IRANOFF
...it is in the air... it may come 
around the corner as you walk down 
the street....

BULJANOFF
...it may step out of a bazaar... it 
may wait for you in a corridor... it 
may hide in the shadow of a 
minaret....

KOPALSKI
(pointing to the 
balcony)
Right now it's on the balcony.

Ninotchka looks toward the balcony and is dumbfounded as she 
sees Leon standing there smiling at her. He walks quietly 
toward her.

LEON
(looking longingly at 
Ninotchka)
They wouldn't let me in so I had to 
get you out.

NINOTCHKA
(still taken aback)
So -- you're behind all this. I should 
have known.

Leon takes her hand and kisses it. The Three Russians exchange 
glances. The CAMERA PANS WITH THEM --leaving Ninotchka and 
Leon as Russians walk discreetly out of the room and close 
the door behind them.

CLOSE SHOT -- LEON AND NINOTCHKA

LEON
Trying to keep me away from you! It 
couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't 
go on forever punching passport 
officials in the nose -- but I found 
a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to 
see you. I wrote and wrote but all 
my letters came back.

NINOTCHKA
The one I got they wouldn't let me 
read.
(carried away by 
emotion)
It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," 
and ended, "Yours, Leon."

LEON
(with great feeling 
and sincerity)
I won't tell you what came between... 
I'll prove it. It will take a long 
time, Ninotchka... at least a 
lifetime.

Ninotchka is aware that she is facing a decision. She knows 
what she wants but still tries to evade a definite answer.

NINOTCHKA
But, Leon, I am only here for a few 
days.

LEON
If you don't stay with me, I'll have 
to continue my fight. I'll travel 
wherever Russian commissions are. 
I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, 
Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world 
will be crowded with Russian 
restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. 
Once you saved your country by going 
back. This time you can save it by 
staying here.

NINOTCHKA
Well, when it is a choice between my 
personal interest and the good of my 
country, how can I waver? No one 
shall say Ninotchka was a bad Russian.

Leon takes her in his arms, they kiss as we

FADE IN:

INT. CITY ROOM OF NEWSPAPER OFFICE - DAY - FULL SHOT

General atmosphere, typical of a busy newspaper office. 
Copy boys running about, shirt-sleeved reporters and rewrite 
men pounding away on typewriters. Little wire baskets 
containing cylinders of copy whizzing back and forth, such 
as are used in some department stores, etc.

SOUND

Morkrum machines, typewriters, telephone bells and all 
other sounds relative to a newspaper office when shot has 
been fully established:

CAMERA STARTS TRUCKING DOWN MAIN AISLE

It takes in the battery of Morkrum machines clattering 
away; the crescent-shaped copy desk; the desk of the 
sporting editor, with a big cauliflower-eared pugilist and 
his manager standing by the side of the sporting editor, a 
hefty guy in his shirtsleeves, smoking a big cigar and 
wearing a green eye-shade; the desk of the society editor, 
a prissy old lady, who takes down a worn copy of the Blue 
Book as the camera passes her and starts looking up some 
data; and any other interesting or typical bits that can 
be thought out. At the far end of the room is the desk of 
Conroy, the City Editor.

Everything shows evidence of feverish activity and great 
haste.

2. CLOSE SHOT

On Conroy, the City Editor at his desk, speaking on the 
telephone.

CONROY
Yeah, that's all I ever get from 
you guys - a lot of hard luck 
stories. You come back here and 
I'll give you an assignment. It 
will be a last interview - with 
the cashier!

He hangs up, looks around with a scowl.

Stew! Stew Smith!

REPORTER
Oh Mr. Conroy, give me a crack at 
that Schuyler story, will you?

CONROY
You?  If you ever got your foot 
into a drawing room, you'd step on 
a sliding rug!  Stew is the only 
man that's got brains enough to 
handle this. Scram!

A Copy Boy rushes by on an errand.

CONROY
Say Spud, did you find Stew?

COPY BOY
Not yet.

CONROY
Well, did you look in the

COPY BOY
First place I looked.

CONROY
Not there, eh? For cryin' out loud, 
where is that? Go and dig him up! 
Stew! Stew Smith!

CAMERA TRUCKS ON:

Until it takes in a sort of make-shift screen, concealing 
a corner of the room.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

3. CLOSE SHOT

On the other side of the screen. Stew Smith is holding 
something in his hand. His hat tilted back on his head, 
and he is regarding this plaything intently. Gallagher is 
sitting close to him, also gazing intently at the plaything. 
Gallagher is a girl, one of the sob sisters[2] on the 
newspaper, dressed in a trim but inexpensive little tailored 
suit.

STEW
Here it is. Pray for me, Gallagher. 
Pray for me. Hold everything . . .

4. CLOSE SHOT

On the object in his hand, one of those hand-puzzles where 
you have to land jumping beans in the holes.

5. DOUBLE SHOT

GALLAGHER
Stew, your hands are shaking. You've 
been drinking again.

STEW
Come on, come on. Here they come, 
Gallagher! Here they come!

Conroy's shouts are heard in the background.

GALLAGHER
(conspiratorially)
The boss is getting hoarse.

STEW
There's the third one. If I don't 
get the last one, there's a certain 
sob sister I know that's going to 
get a kick right in the . . . oh! 
Whoops, almost had that.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

Conroy, the City Editor at his desk, looking about with a 
scowl for Stew.

CONROY
(bellowing)
Stew! Stew Smith!

The Copy Boy races over to whisper something to Conroy.

CONROY
What? The screen?

7. CLOSE SHOT
On Stew Smith

STEW
Gallagher! I made it!

8. MEDIUM SHOT (FROM CONROY'S ANGLE)

The screen, concealing the washbasin corner.

CONTINUATION, SCENE 6

A wrathy Conroy, his eyes centering suspiciously on 
something. With his eyes on the screen, Conroy reaches out 
and grasps a heavy telephone book on the corner of his 
desk. Still looking off, he heaves it forcefully.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

Showing the screen. The telephone book crashes into it, 
overturning it and revealing Stew and Gallagher on the 
other side. They both look up, startled. The newsroom erupts 
in laughter.

CONTINUATION, SCENE 6

Conroy, glaring off fiercely.

CONROY
Come over here!

10. MEDIUM SHOT

Conroy at his desk. Stew saunters into the scene.

STEW
Look, I quit!

CONROY
Yeah?

STEW
Yeah.

CONROY
Yeah?

STEW
You're always picking on me. It 
took me three hours to get those 
little gadgets in those holes, and 
you screw it up in a minute. Hey, 
look!

He gives the hand-puzzle to Conroy, who is immediately 
captivated by the fascinating object in his hand.

CLOSE DOUBLE SHOT

STEW
(superior)
Mmm, not as easy as it looks, is 
it?

Conroy puts it down with a disgusted look.

CONROY
Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would 
it be imposing too much upon you 
if I asked you to do a little work 
today? Just to sort of break the 
monotony?

STEW
With me you can always do business.

CONROY
Do you know what to do in a drawing-
room?

STEW
It isn't a question of knowing 
what to do, it's knowing how to 
get in one that counts.

The telephone rings, Conroy answers it.

CONROY
(speaking on the 
phone)
Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay.

He hangs up, turns back to Stew.

CONROY
Now listen, we've got a tip that 
the Schuyler family has finally 
made a deal with that chorus dame.

STEW
Gloria Golden?

CONROY
Yeah, little Gloria.

STEW
The human cash register. Got her 
hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?

CONROY
Right - for the first time this 
year.

STEW
(modestly)
Well - it's only April.

CONROY
Come on, get going, get going!

STEW
(loftily)
Get going where? I can write that 
yarn without stepping out of the 
office.

CONROY
Yeah - and get us into a million 
dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be 
the first time. Now, you get over 
there and get a statement out of 
the old lady, the sister, or the 
kid. Any of them - but get it.

STEW
(resigned)
All right. Give me a voucher for 
expenses.

12. CLOSE DOUBLE SHOT (ANOTHER ANGLE)

CONROY
What expenses? All you need is 
carfare to Long Island. You'd better 
get a shave and a shine, because 
you, you're going to have a tough 
time getting in there as it is.

STEW
I know those bluenoses. Their 
ancestors refused to come over on 
the Mayflower because they didn't 
want to rub elbows with the 
tourists. So they swam over.

He turns away and exits.

FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

EXT. THE SCHUYLER HOUSE - DAY - MEDIUM SHOT

Someone pacing outside the mansion gates.

EXT. THE SCHUYLER HOUSE (ANOTHER ANGLE) - DAY - CLOSE SHOT

A guard dog pacing inside the gates.

INT. INSIDE THE MANSION - DAY - CLOSE SHOT

A parrot on its perch, hopping from foot to foot.

INT. SCHUYLER DRAWING ROOM - DAY - CLOSE SHOT

Michael Schuyler, a callow youth with the usual dissipated, 
spoiled look. His fingers are nipping out little chunks of 
a folded piece of paper, dropping the bits on the floor. 
This is indicative of a habit of the individual in question 
when undergoing nervous stress. He is very fidgety and 
apprehensive, as he glances around.

CAMERA PANS OVER TO SHOW

Anne Schuyler, a beautiful and aristocratic, though slightly 
hard girl, a few years older than Michael.

CAMERA PANS OVER TO SHOW

Mrs. Stuyvesand Van Alstyne Schuyler, mother of Anne and 
Michael. A grande dame, stern and glowering. Her attitude 
indicates suppressed nervousness and anger. She glares 
over in the direction of Michael. Then she turns and looks 
in another direction.

MRS. SCHUYLER
(viciously)
Dexter Grayson, if you were any 
kind of a lawyer, you'd get those 
letters back!

CAMERA PANS OVER TO SHOW

Dexter Grayson, the family lawyer standing, his hands 
clasped behind his back, just completing the pacing of a 
few short steps in his best courtroom manner, his head 
bowed in an attitude of deepest thought. He is dressed in 
striped afternoon trousers and black coat. He turns to 
regard Mrs. Schuyler.

GRAYSON
But I keep telling you how difficult 
it is, Mrs. Schuyler. The last 
time I asked her for those letters, 
she made very uncouth noises with 
her mouth.

CAMERA PANS OVER TO SHOW

Anne Schuyler, trying desperately to keep from laughing.

CAMERA DRAWS BACK

To reveal a full shot of the room and group. They are in 
the magnificent drawing room of the Schuyler home, 
resembling the Union Depot and furnished with almost 
imperial splendor and magnificence. They very much resemble 
a jury in session. As they continue:

MICHAEL
I don't know why you're making all 
this fuss. I only sent her six of 
them.

MRS. SCHUYLER
(sarcastic)
If you had to make a fool of 
yourself, why didn't you tell it 
to her instead of writing?

MICHAEL
Because I couldn't get her on the 
phone.

MRS. SCHUYLER
Imbecile!

ANNE
You should have known better than 
to write, Romeo. I found that out 
a long time ago.

MRS. SCHUYLER
I should say you had. At the rate 
you two are going, we'll have to 
leave the country to save our faces.

ANNE
Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over 
to Monte Carlo. It's a great place 
to save a face.

MRS. SCHUYLER
Oh, shut up!

A butler appears in the doorway. He is about to say 
something, but he stammers and turns.

MRS. SCHUYLER
(stopping him)
What is it, Smythe?

SMYTHE
Pardon me, madam - but what am I 
to say to the newspapermen?

Mrs. Schuyler looks distractedly at Grayson.

17. CLOSER SHOT

Mrs. Schuyler and Grayson. She rises and speaks imperiously:

MRS. SCHUYLER
Dexter, go out and tell those 
ruffians I have nothing to say.

Grayson faces her placatingly.

GRAYSON
You can't do that. Leave it to me. 
I know how to handle reporters.

MRS. SCHUYLER
(with a shudder)
All right, then - get it over with.

MEDIUM FULL SHOT

Grayson turns officiously toward the waiting butler.

GRAYSON
We've decided to see the reporters. 
Send in the man from the Tribune 
first.

SMYTHE
Very good, sir.

MRS. SCHUYLER
Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of 
soda, quick - double strength. I 
know those news mongrels[3] will 
upset me.

SMYTHE
I've anticipated it, madame. The 
bicarbonate is ready.

The butler exits.

INT. SCHUYLER LIBRARY - DAY - FULL SHOT

This room resembles the Grand Central Station. It is lined 
with bookcases filled with gorgeous first editions and 
special bindings, and is furnished in the extreme of 
magnificence and luxury.

Present are Stew and Bingy, reporter from the Tribune. 
Stew is seated, idly leafing through a first edition.

Bingy, still with his hat on, spots an expensive music box 
on a nearby table, opens it and does a little jig to the 
tune that is emitted.

20. CLOSER SHOT

Bingy, as he lingers at the table. He is a lazy, sloppy-
looking guy.  His face needs a shave and his pants need 
pressing. There is a spot of dried ketchup on his tie. On 
the table is a humidor. Bingy opens it and lifts out a 
handful of cigars.

CLOSE SHOT - STEW

As he looks up from the book, he suggests:

STEW
Hey Bingy, you'll find the 
silverware in the dining room.

CONTINUATION, SCENE 20

Bingy turns, putting the cigars in his pocket.

BINGY
Much obliged.

MEDIUM FULL SHOT

Smythe enters.

SMYTHE
(frigidly)
Mr. Grayson has decided to see 
you.

Both Stew and Bingy start forward eagerly. Smythe continues:

SMYTHE
The gentleman from the Tribune, 
first.

CLOSER THREE SHOT

Bingy beams broadly and Stew is disappointed.

STEW
There are no gentlemen on the 
Tribune.

SMYTHE
I understand, sir.

Smythe leads the way out. As Bingy passes by, Stew trips 
him.

BINGY
Say, take it easy! Take it easy! 
Listen, my boy. No use you hanging 
around here. Just buy the Tribune 
tonight and read all about it. You 
can rewrite it for your last 
edition.

STEW
Couldn't make the last edition. 
It'd take me four hours to translate 
your story into English.

BINGY
Oh, is that so?

STEW
I'm afraid.

Bingy turns to leave.

STEW
Take off your hat. You might make 
an impression.

Bingy dutifully doffs his hat.

STEW
Impossible. Put it on again.

BINGY
Hey, make up your mind, will you?

Bingy hurriedly puts his hat back on as he disappears.

INT. SCHUYLER DRAWING ROOM - DAY - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

By the door which leads out into the hall. The butler enters 
and stops, standing stiffly. Bingy enters behind him, 
shambling awkwardly. He stops in some consternation as he 
sees:

25. MEDIUM SHOT (FROM HIS ANGLE)

The Schuyler jury. Grayson, Mrs. Schuyler, Anne and Michael, 
all surveying him in varying degrees of unfriendliness.

CONTINUATION, SCENE 24

Bingy hesitates uneasily as he regards this impressive 
assemblage. Quickly, he takes his hat back off. Then he 
smiles nervously and starts forward.

BINGY
Hi, folks!

CONTINUATION, SCENE 25

Grayson comes forward to meet him, attempting to be very 
cordial. Bingy is seized by a sudden impulse to sneeze. He 
does so, violently.  There is awkward silence. Mrs. Schuyler 
throws off a visible shudder.

BINGY
What's the matter? Isn't there a 
'bless you' in the crowd?

GRAYSON
You're the Tribune man?

BINGY
Yeah, hello. How are you?

Bingy extends his hand. Grayson pointedly ignores it.

GRAYSON
(cordially)
Fine. Have a seat.

BINGY
Thanks, I will.

Bingy crosses the room, taking note of the beauteous Anne.

GRAYSON
This way.

BINGY
Oh, man!

Bingy sits gingerly on the edge of a handsome chair.

BINGY
Oh, boy!

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Bingy and Grayson. Grayson picks up a very flossy and 
expensive cigarette box from the small end table beside 
the chair. It is made of gold and semi-precious stones are 
inset in the cover. Grayson opens the lid and takes out a 
cigarette, but pointedly does not offer one to Bingy.

Grayson remains standing before the reporter, who is very 
uncomfortable and ill at ease.

GRAYSON
Fine newspaper the Tribune.

BINGY
Well, I should say!

GRAYSON
I knew your managing editor very 
well.

BINGY
Is that so?

GRAYSON
Yale '21, I believe.

BINGY
(uncomprehending)
Huh?

GRAYSON
We were classmates.

CLOSE SHOT - MRS. SCHUYLER

She clears her throat menacingly, as she looks sternly at 
Grayson.

MRS. SCHUYLER
Ahem!

BINGY
What's the matter? She got a cold?

CONTINUATION, SCENE 26

Bingy and Grayson. Both look over. Grayson gives her a 
quick reassuring glance, as though to say "leave it to me 
now." He continues his conversation with the reporter.

GRAYSON
I got him his job on the paper. 
I'm a stock-holder, you know.

BINGY
Is that so?

GRAYSON
As one Tribune man to another

He laughs.

BINGY
(laughs)
Yeah!

GRAYSON
But right now I'm acting in the 
capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's 
attorney.

BINGY
Oh, that's all right with me. I 
won't hold it against you. But you 
see, I'm here to find out about

GRAYSON
I know, I know. But there's no 
truth in the story whatsoever.

BINGY
Oh yeah?

28. MEDIUM SHOT

Grayson and Bingy. He takes Bingy by the arm and leads him 
over to a corner of the room, assuming a confidential pose.

GRAYSON
(speaking as they 
walk)
However, I've taken the trouble to 
prepare a little statement. Here 
it is. Here.

CLOSER TWO SHOT

Grayson and Bingy. Grayson takes an envelope out of his 
pocket and hands it to Bingy. Bingy opens the flap and 
sees the contents.

INSERT: ENVELOPE

The corner of a fifty dollar bill protrudes.

BACK TO SCENE:

Bingy quickly shuts the envelope up. Grayson is watching 
him closely.

GRAYSON
So, you see how silly that rumor 
is?

BINGY
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.

GRAYSON
That's what I wanted to say, but I 
couldn't think of it.

Grayson starts leading him toward the door. CAMERA PANS 
WITH THEM as Grayson leads him toward the door, talking as 
they walk.

GRAYSON
Thank you very much.

BINGY
All right, all right, don't mention 
it.

GRAYSON
Give my regards to your managing 
editor.

BINGY
I certainly will.

They stop at the door. Bingy extends a handshake, which is 
again refused. He stops and looks back at the jury.

MEDIUM SHOT FROM HIS ANGLE

The Schuylers all sitting silently and contemplating him.

BINGY
Well, so long folks!

He flutters his eyes at Anne.

BINGY
Thanks!

He takes one last look at Mrs. Schuyler and is again gripped 
by a violent sneeze.

MRS. SCHUYLER
(rising to the 
occasion)
Uh, bless you!

ALL
Bless you!

BINGY
Thanks.

The butler appears in the doorway behind him. Bingy exits 
past him, beaming.

BINGY
(waving to butler)
So long!

Grayson nods to the butler.

GRAYSON
Smythe, bring in the other reporter.

SMYTHE
Yes, sir.

INT. SCHUYLER DRAWING ROOM - MEDIUM FULL SHOT

The group awaiting the advent of the Post reporter. Stew 
is shown in by the butler, still carrying the Conrad book 
in his hand. They give him the once-over. Mrs. Schuyler 
raises her lorgnette with a magnificent gesture. Stew eyes 
them with animation, not in the slightest discouraged by 
this supercilious scrutiny. He starts toward them.

32. MEDIUM SHOT

As Stew approaches them.

STEW
Schuyler's the name, I presume?  
Yes, thank you, thank you. My name's 
Smith - Stewart Smith. No relation 
to John, Joe, Trade or Mark. Of 
course you can't have everything.

He smiles engagingly on them. Stew addresses Mrs. Schuyler 
ingratiatingly, disregarding her expression of obvious 
distaste.

STEW
Nice set of Conrads you have out 
there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just 
glancing through this one.
(indicates the book 
in his hand)
What's Michael tearing the paper 
about?

GRAYSON
Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a 
bit put out by all the rumors going 
around.

33. CLOSER SHOT - STEW AND GRAYSON

STEW
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a 
breach-of-promise case a rumor?

GRAYSON
No breach-of-promise case has been 
filed. The matter has been settled 
out of court.

STEW
(very cagey)
Oh I see, but Gloria doesn't seem 
to be satisfied with the twenty 
thousand dollars.

MEDIUM SHOT OF GROUP

At this, Mrs. Schuyler rises wrathfully.

MRS. SCHUYLER
(furiously to Grayson)
Dexter Grayson, you told me it was 
only ten thousandand you didn't 
even get those letters from that 
Jezebel!

STEW
Oh, so you did give her ten thousand 
dollars, eh? and there are 
letters...

Behind Stew's back, Grayson makes violent gestures for her 
to shut up.

STEW
Well, well. That takes it out of 
the rumor class, doesn't it?

GRAYSON
We admit nothing. However, I have 
a little statement all prepared.

He takes Stew's arm and walks him off toward a corner much 
in the same manner as he handled Bingy, and lowers his 
voice confidentially.

35. CLOSER SHOT - STEW AND GRAYSON

Apart from the others.

STEW
A statement? Good.

GRAYSON
I have it here.

STEW
Good.

Grayson takes an envelope out of his pocket and hands it 
to Stew. Stew puts the book under his arm, takes the 
envelope and extracts the contents. It is another greenback.

STEW
(with interest)
Fifty bucks, eh?

He regards it a moment, then replaces the bill in the 
envelope. His voice is matter-of-fact, and almost casual.

STEW
Don't you know you should never 
offer a newspaper man more than 
two dollars?  If you do, he'll 
think it's counterfeit. I don't 
need fifty dollars. As a matter of 
fact, I've got fifty dollars.

Grayson is considerably disconcerted. He tries again.

GRAYSON
The man from the Tribune seemed 
perfectly satisfied.

STEW
Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He 
never saw fifty dollars before. 
You could have bought him for six 
bits. Funny thing about Bingy. The 
more he gets - the more he prints. 
He looks stupid, doesn't he? But 
oh how smart he gets when he bends 
over a typewriter.

He hands the envelope back to Grayson and turns away.

36. MEDIUM SHOT

Schuyler group - taking his action with dismay. Stew starts 
walking back toward them, talking as he walks, Grayson 
beside him, considerably distracted.

STEW
So ten grand was the amount you 
gave the girl? Any other statement 
you folks would like to make?

There is an explosive chorus from the group.

GROUP
(ad-lib talking at 
the same time)
That's not so!

We have nothing more to say!

We'll make no statements.

He turns to them, holding up his hand and speaking 
plaintively.

STEW
Wait a minute. Don't get excited. 
I wouldn't worry about it. A little 
publicity never hurt anybody.

CLOSE SHOT - MRS. SCHUYLER

She is on the point of an apopletic stroke. She advances 
menacingly toward Stew. She calls to Grayson.

MRS. SCHUYLER
(shrieking at him)
Dexter, have this person leave 
immediately.

MEDIUM SHOT - THE GROUP

Stew is not at all perturbed. Dexter takes him by the arm 
and starts to lead him out.

GRAYSON
I think you'd better go.

STEW
Go?! Wait a minute - that's a great 
story! Newspaper reporter was 
forcibly ejected from Schuyler 
Mansion, and

Anne comes up to him.

ANNE
Wait a minute

He faces her and cannot help but register an appreciation 
of her beauty.

ANNE
Don't mind Mother.

STEW
(cheerfully)
I don't mind her if you don't.

CONTINUATION SCENE 37

Mrs. Schuyler, almost choking in her wrath at this 
outrageous stranger.

MRS. SCHUYLER
Anne!

CLOSE SHOT - ANNE AND STEW

Anne stifles a smile at this cheerful insolence.

ANNE
I'm sure you're quite willing to 
be decent about this.

STEW
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want 
to be noble.

Anne continues in her most devastating manner.

ANNE
You're not going to print this 
silly thing, are you?

STEW
(noncomittally)
No? Why not?

She puts her hand lightly on his arm.

ANNE
Because my name's Schuyler too. 
And I haven't done a thing, but 
I'll suffer with Michael. And so 
will Mother.

CLOSEUP - STEW

He has been listening to this and enjoying it immensely. 
He looks over at Mrs. Schuyler.

41. REVERSE ANGLE ON MRS. SCHUYLER

Who is making a show of holding back a flood of tears.

CONTINUATION SCENE 40

STEW
Mother's suffering already!

CONTINUATION SCENE 39
Anne, not wanting to lose her point, 
looks up at Stew pleadingly.

ANNE
As a special favor to me, you won't 
print that story, will you?

CONTINUATION SCENE 40

Stew, looking down at her in frank approval and admiration.

ANNE
(pleading)
Please

Stew hesitates still.

42. MEDIUM SHOT

Mrs. Schuyler, Michael, and Grayson. All watching the couple 
intently, hanging on the next wordswondering if Anne is 
going to succeed. They are tense and expectant.

CLOSE SHOT - ANNE AND STEW

He is looking down into her soft, melting eyes. Then he 
smiles.

STEW
You know something, lady, if you 
sold life insurance, I'd go for a 
policy in sixty seconds.

ANNE
Oh, thank you, I knew you'd 
understand.

CONTINUATION SCENE 42
The three. They relax and exchange 
relieved and triumphant glances. 
Apparently Anne has won.

MEDIUM SHOT - ENTIRE GROUP

Stew turns aside.

STEW
May I use your telephone?

ANNE
(eagerly)
Certainly. Right over there.

STEW
You're all right.

She indicates. Stew starts for the telephone. Anne walks 
to her mother's side. Stew gets to the telephone and picks 
up the receiver.

STEW
Hello, Beekman 1300?
(he turns to wink 
at the group)
That's an unlucky number. You know 
that, don't you?

CLOSE SHOT - STEW

At the telephone. He turns back to the instrument as he 
gets his connection.

STEW
(into phone)
Hello, Toots? Is Conroy there?  
Give me Conroy.
(pause)
He isn't? Try the washroom, will 
you?

While he waits for the connection, he turns and addresses 
the group expansively.

STEW
Say, I interviewed a swell guy the 
other day - Einstein. Swell guy, a 
little eccentric, but swell. Doesn't 
wear any garters. Neither do I as 
a matter of fact. What good are 
garters anyway?
(he turns back to 
the phone)
Hello, Conroy? This is Smith 
talking. I'm up at the Schuylers. 
No, I'm not having tea - that is, 
not yet.
(again, he winks 
expansively at the 
groupthen returns 
to Conroy)
Is she beautiful? Oh boss, her 
pictures don't do her justice. If 
I was that guy Ziegfield - what?

46. CLOSE SHOT - ANNE AND MRS. SCHUYLER

Anne smiles in spite of herself at this flattery. Stew's 
voice goes on.

STEW'S VOICE
Yes, it's easy to see where her 
beauty comes from. From her mother.

For the first time, Mrs. Schuyler unbends to the extent of 
giving forth a smile. She cannot help but be pleased at 
this compliment. The atmosphere is now very friendly. 
Everybody feels that everything is all right.

CONTINUATION SCENE 45

Stew at the phone

STEW
Now wait a minute. Just hold on. 
Keep your shirt on. I'm coming to 
that. The Schuylers admit the story 
is true. Right. They gave the gal 
ten thousand bucks. But she's got 
some letters - and she's holding 
out for more dough - and it looks 
to me like she's going to get it.

47. MEDIUM SHOT - SCHUYLER GROUP

Horrified and shocked at this betrayal and double-crossing.

STEW
(on the 
phonebreezily)
Right boss. I'll be right over. 
Right - no, I don't think I can 
get any pictures now. Right.

He casually hangs up and turns from the phone.

MRS. SCHUYLER
(involuntary gasp)
Oh-h-h . . .!

Anne confronts him as if he were a reptile of the lowest 
order.

ANNE
(voice cold as ice)
I've met some rotters in my time, 
but without a doubt, you're the 
lowest excuse for a man I've ever 
had the misfortune to meet

Stew starts walking toward the door, still holding his 
book. The family is tremendously indignant and agitated.

Stew stops, turns, looks at them. He is met by icy glares. 
He indignantly takes a nickel out of his pocket and hands 
it to Grayson.

STEW
(with dignity)
Well, if you feel that way about 
it, here's a nickel for the phone 
call.

He glares at themturns and walks out.

They watch him walk out, stunned and open-mouthed.

FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

INT. JOE'S SPEAKEASY - DAY

MEDIUM FULL SHOT

A reasonably respectable speakeasy, smoke-filled. Quite a 
number of men and a few women are leaning on the bar and 
seated around at the tables. Stew and Gallagher are seated 
at one of the rude round tables, smoking, drinks before 
them. Gallagher is reading the newspaper story.

49. CLOSE SHOT - STEW AND GALLAGHER

She is grinning at the story.

STEW
and she walked up to me and put 
her hand on my shoulder and said,
(mimicking Anne)
'Mr. Smith, You wouldn't print 
that story, would you?' Oh no, I 
wouldn't print it - read it!

CLOSE SHOT - GALLAGHER

Over Stew's shoulder. She laughs at his attempted imitation.

GALLAGHER
You're sure going to be poison to 
that Junior Leaguer[4] from now 
on!

STEW
I hope not . . . I've got to call 
on her this morning!

Gallagher looks up in astonishment.

GALLAGHER
You what?

STEW
Sure, I must drop in on the mad 
wench. Her wounds need soothing.

GALLAGHER
For heaven's sake, Stew, are you 
completely bats? What for? I thought 
the story was cold. You can't go 
back there.

STEW
Sure, the story is cold, but I'm 
not. I'm sizzling - look! Psst!

He moistens a finger, touches it to his wrist, and makes a 
sizzle noise.

Gallagher looks over quizzicallya little suspiciousa 
little jealous.

GALLAGHER
(a drawn-out knowing 
utterance)
O-o-oh! Came the dawn, came the 
dawn!

CLOSE SHOT - STEW

Over Gallagher's shoulder.

STEW
And with it came love! Oh Gallagher, 
you've got to meet her. She's it

GALLAGHER
and that

STEW
(enthusing)
and those and them.

Gallagher takes a sip of her drink before answering.

GALLAGHER
Well, I've seen her pictures, and 
I don't think she's so hot.

STEW
(disparaging gesture)
Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her 
pictures don't do her justice. 
Why, Gallagher, she's queenly - 
she is queenly - and I know queens!
(continues in 
exaltation)
And oh, has she got herself a nose - 
and I know noses too. That little 
snozzle of hers is the berries, I 
tell you. And is she cute when she 
throws that little snozzle to the 
high heavens!

52. DOUBLE SHOT

GALLAGHER
Of course I haven't got a nose.

Stew gives her a hurt look.

STEW
(shaking his head)
Sure, sure. You've got a nose, 
Gallagher. You've got a nose. But 
there's different women, Gallagher. 
You know, like brewery horses and 
thoroughbreds.

GALLAGHER
(deliberately 
misunderstanding)
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on 
her. I wouldn't call her a brewery 
horse.

STEW
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!

GALLAGHER
And the rest of us are truck horses?

STEW
(reproachfully)
There you go, talking like a woman!

GALLAGHER
(a trifle resentfully)
Well!

STEW
Well, you're my pal, aren't you? 
Then don't turn female on me.

During these last few speeches, Gallagher has been regarding 
him with a curious expression. She loves being his pal, 
but wishes he would realize she is also a woman.

53. MEDIUM SHOT

Stew seems a little resentful of her attitude. He rises.

STEW
Pay that check, will you Gallagher? 
I'll give it back to you some time. 
Maybe.

He flourishes the book of Conrad, which has been lying on 
the table in front of him, and makes a grand gesture.

STEW
I go now - I go with Conrad in 
quest of my youth! Fry those 
tomatoes, will you, Gallagher?

He strikes a poseand exits.

Gallagher, sits, looking after him, considerably disturbed.

CLOSER SHOT - GALLAGHER

Sitting, looking dismally after Stew.

She opens her bag and takes out a mirror, surveying herself 
with frank disapproval. She pulls out a curl of hair before 
each ear, tries to soften the severe brim of the hat. She 
puts a finger to the tip of her nose and tilts it up, 
studying the effect. Then, with a sigh of disgust, she 
throws mirror and bag onto the table.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SCHUYLER ENTRANCE HALL - DAY - LONG SHOT

Smythe, the butler, previously introduced, comes from the 
direction of the rear of the house, and proceeds down the 
long, vast hallway towards the front door. The bell keeps 
ringing steadily.

The butler reaches the wide front door.

56. CLOSER SHOT

As the butler opens the door and reveals Stew standing 
outside, hatless, a book in his hand, a spring overcoat 
slightly askew, the pockets bulging with contents.  The 
butler quickly tries to slam the door in Stew's face, but 
Stew's right foot comes forward with a practiced 
newspaperman's gesture and he forces his way into the room.

STEW
(reproachfully)
Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice?  
Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? 
Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, 
isn't it?

SMYTHE
(stiffly)
The name is Smythe.

STEW
Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y 
, huh?
(wags his head)
Congratulations! What a small world. 
Brothers under livery. Shake!
(he grabs the 
butler's hand)
Now, as a Smith to a Smythe

SMYTHE
(glacially)
Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.

TWO SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE

STEW
I know, I know. I waited outside 
till she went out. She's a very 
nice lady, but we don't vibrate 
well together.

58. MEDIUM SHOT
Anne, dressed in smart sports 
clothes, starts to cross thru the 
hall. She stops as she sees the 
butler engaged in conversation 
with Stew.

SMYTHE
(hollowly)
No one's at home, sir.

Anne starts walking toward them. Stew spots her.

STEW
Now Jeeves, what would you call 
this - 'no one'?

Anne comes up to them.

CLOSER THREE SHOT

Anne looks up and sees that the butler is frowning and 
uncomfortable and addresses him.

ANNE
What's wrong?

SMYTHE
Mrs. Schuyler left orders, Miss, 
that if this person came here again, 
I was to call the police.

STEW
That's a good idea - telephone the 
police. The number is Spring 3100. 
Get a couple of cops over and we 
can have a rubber of bridge.

ANNE
You may go, Smythe.

SMYTHE
But I

STEW
Now the lady said you may go

The butler bows stiffly and exits.

ANNE
(to Stewdirectly)
What do you want?

STEW
Well, I tell you, yesterday when I 
was here, I had one of your books 
in my hand, and when I got outside, 
I realized I still had your book 
in my hand. So as long as I had 
your book in my hand, I thought I 
might as well take it home and 
read it. This morning, I got up 
and put your book in my hand, and 
here's your book in your hand.

He extends the Conrad book, and Anne, making no effort to 
take it, he throws it on the table.

ANNE
(haughty)
That's considerate of you.

STEW
Yeah, that was considerate of me. 
I recommend you read it.

CLOSER TWO SHOT

ANNE
(stiffly)
I'm not interested in your literary 
recommendations.

STEW
Well, maybe it's a bit heavy for 
you. Perhaps if you'd like something 
lighter - something with a touch 
of romance

He takes a package of letters out of his overcoat pocket 
held together by a rubber band. He extracts one of them 
and opens it.

STEW
Just listen to this
(reading)
Adorable Babykins
Does her miss her Baby? Him sends 
his booful li'l sweetums a billion 
oceans full of kisses. Bobo is so 
lonely!

ANNE
(interrupting coldly)
Just a moment. I don't see how 
that trash could possibly concern 
me.

Stew advances a little closer, putting up a finger.

STEW
(mysteriously)
Ah!  But you don't know who Bobo 
is. And you don't know who Babykins 
is.

ANNE
I'm not interested. Smythe will 
open the door.

She begins to walk away.

STEW
(brightly)
But Bobo is your brother, Michael. 
And of course nobody would ever 
guess who Babykins is.

Anne turns and stares at him, incredulously, for a moment.

ANNE
Where did you get those letters?

STEW
I stole them when I was interviewing 
Babykins about Bobo.

Anne looks up coldly.

ANNE
I suppose you're going to print 
them?

STEW
No - give you another guess.

61. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT (TRUCK SHOT)

The two.

Anne surveys him with frank scorn and dislike.

ANNE
(scornfully)
Oh, I don't need another guess. 
It's quite obvious.

STEW
So, it's obvious, huh?

She turns toward the library.

ANNE
Will you step into the library?

STEW
(with alacrity)
Sure, I'll take a chance.

Anne walks majestically with head held highthru the 
hallthru the living room and to the library. CAMERA 
TRUCKING AHEAD OF THEM. This is a very long walk with Anne 
walking ahead, Stew trailing.

STEW
(while walking with 
Anne single file)
You know, the Indians used to walk 
like this.
(pause)
Except the squaw always walked in 
the back
(pause)
You know why that was? That was in 
case of attack from the front.
(pause)
Of course, if the attack was from 
the rear, she had to depend upon 
her papoose.
(pause)
Oh yes, the papooses always had 
bows and arrows.
(pause)
Of course, if she wasn't 
marriedthen she'd have to protect 
her own - er, er
(indicates rear 
with thumb over 
shoulder - still 
walking)
What country is this library in?
(pause)
Miss Schuyler, how about carfare 
back to the front door, huh?

INT. SCHUYLER LIBRARY - MEDIUM SHOT

Anne sweeps in, followed by Stew. She walks directly to a 
desk, opens a drawer and takes out a large check book. She 
draws up a chair and seats herself.

63. CLOSE SHOT

Anne at the desk, starting to fill in the date on a blank 
check.

ANNE
What are your initials - Mr. - er

CLOSE SHOT - STEW

Who has remained standing. He is watching her with a 
peculiar expression.

STEW
Smith. Stewart Smith. My friends 
call me Stew. It's an injustice 
too because I hold my liquor all 
right.

CONTINUATION SCENE 63

Anne writes on the check. Then she looks up.

ANNE
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?

65. DOUBLE SHOT

STEW
For what?

ANNE
For the letters, of course.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

As Stew walks closer and addreses her.

STEW
Gee, you shouldn't do that, Miss 
Schuyler. That's all right for 
your lawyer friend, but you 
shouldn't go around thinking you 
can buy people.
(hands her the 
letters)
They're yours.

Anne has been listening to him with a puzzled expression, 
impressed by his obvious sincerity.

ANNE
I don't know how to thank you. 
Mother'll be so grateful - she'll 
probably want to kiss you.

STEW
Your mother will want to kiss me? 
Give me back my letters.
(grabs the letters)
That's the breaks I get. It's the 
mothers that are always grateful 
to me.
(with a smile, he 
hands the letters 
back)
Here.

ANNE
You're a peculiar person. Why the 
other day I pleaded with you not 
to send in that story and 
(gestures with 
letters)

67. CLOSE TWO SHOT

STEW
(patiently again)
I know but that was news. This is 
blackmail and I don't like 
blackmail.

Anne is regarding him with searching scrutiny. She smiles. 
Her icy, belligerent attitude has vanished.

ANNE
won't even pretend it isn't a very 
great favor. I wish there was 
something I could do for you

STEW
Well, you could make this table a 
little - uh - a little less wide.
(he leans over closer 
to her)
There is something you can do for 
me, Miss Schuyler.

The smile goes out of Anne's eyesthe suspicion returnsshe 
is saying to herself"I was right the first time!"

STEW
(engagingly)
I haven't had any lunch yet. Have 
you got anything in the icebox?

The hard, disdainful look leaves Anne's face as she stares 
at this incredible guy with his incredible request. With a 
twinkle in her eyes, she responds:

ANNE
Oh, you fool!

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SCHUYLER DINING ROOM

MED. FULL SHOT

A lovely, sunny room, cretonne drapes and colorful painted 
furniture. Stew and Anne are sitting at the table. Anne 
looks amused and definitely speculative. Stew has the manner 
of having lived in this house all his life. He draws the 
cup of tea to him and puts in a lump or two of sugar.

Between him and Anne on the corner of the table is a 
modernistic, squatty little tea-pot.

STEW
After years of research, I finally 
discovered that I was the only guy 
in the world who hadn't written a 
play, so believe it or not, in my 
spare time I'm now writing a play.

CLOSE TWO SHOT

Anne is casually amused.

ANNE
Really?

STEW
Yeah, I haven't figured out the 
plot yet, but it's laid in a 
Siberian village.

ANNE
You're a bit eccentric, aren't 
you?

STEW
Me? No - most ordinary guy in the 
world, me. Only one thing wrong 
with me

ANNE
You don't wear garters!

Stew helps himself to another lump of sugar.

STEW
Naw, that's just a symbol of my 
independence.

He leans closer, looking directly into her face.

STEW
I'm color blind. That's what's 
wrong - I'm color blind. I've been 
sitting here for a half hour looking 
at you and I don't know yet whether 
your eyes are blue or violet.

Anne smiles at this unexpected statement, and stares at 
him very critically.

ANNE
I'm just beginning to believe that 
something could be done with you.

STEW
Say, you could do anything with me 
you wanted to. Putty - just putty, 
that's me.
(leaning closer)
Now getting back to those eyes of 
yours - would you mind if I kind 
of got closer so I could see them?

ANNE
Not if you're going to lose any 
sleep about it.

70. CLOSE SHOT

He gets closer, takes her chin in his hand and gets an 
eyeful.

ANNE
Now, how would you like themopen 
like this?

She smiles radiantly.

STEW
Close them both.
(getting warm)
Something tells me I'd better leave.

During the last speech Mrs. Schuyler enters and stops in 
the doorway, surveying this astonishing scene with stupefied 
indignation and rage.

Anne gets quickly to her feet as Mrs. Schuyler sails 
forward.

MRS. SCHUYLER
That's an excellent idea.

ANNE
Oh, hello Mother!

STEW
(easily)
Hello - hello, Mrs. Schuyler. Come 
right in. Will you have a slug of 
tea?

He hospitably indicates the table. Mrs. Schuyler is 
speechless with fury. She does not immediately reply. Then:

MRS. SCHUYLER
What is this person doing here?

ANNE
Why

Stew goes on.

STEW
As a matter of fact, I was just 
trying to decide the color of Anne's 
eyes. I can't tell whether they're 
blue, or whether they're violet. 
What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler?

MRS. SCHUYLER
(bursting)
Why

ANNE
(quickly)
Don't say it, Mother, please. Mr. 
Smith came here today to do us a 
great favor.

71. CLOSER SHOT

Anne, Mrs. Schuyler and Stew. Mrs. Schuyler, with an effort, 
restraining her impulse to yank Stew out by the collar, 
speaks:

MRS. SCHUYLER
(bursting with wrath)
Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a 
great favor.

STEW
(elaborate bow)
With pleasure, Madame!

MRS. SCHUYLER
Get out of here.

ANNE
(distressed)
Oh, Mother!

STEW
(with dignity)
It's all right. It's all right, 
Anne. I can take a hint. A bit 
subtle, but I get it. It's all 
right.

ANNE
Please go. I'll explain to Mother.

He steps close to Mrs. Schuyler's side.

STEW
The caviar was lovely, Madam.

72. WIDER SHOT

Stew starts to the door, smiles at Anne, and remarks to 
Mrs. Schuyler as he passes her:

STEW
You must come over and see us 
sometime.

Mrs. Schuyler freezes in inarticulate anger, as Stew gives 
a courtly bow and exits.

FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

INT. SCHUYLER DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

73. MEDIUM SHOT

Anne in a stunning evening dress is seated, a cocktail in 
one hand, cigarette in the other. Dexter Grayson, in evening 
clothes, is standing before her.

GRAYSON
Where were you yesterday?

CLOSE SHOT - ANNE

She has a faraway, speculative look in her eyes.

ANNE
Oh, Stew and I went for a long 
ride.
(dreamily)
Dexter, is there any finishing 
school we can send him to?

CLOSE SHOT - GRAYSON

GRAYSON
(witheringly)
Yes - Sing Sing.

CONTINUATION SCENE 74
Anne. She ignores this crack.

ANNE
Just the same, he's going to be a 
different person when I get through 
with him.

CONTINUATION SCENE 75
Grayson. He is looking at her, 
deeply disturbed.

GRAYSON
When you get through with him?

76. DOUBLE SHOT

ANNE
Yes, it'll be a very interesting 
experiment.

GRAYSON
(sneering)
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?

ANNE
Exactly.

GRAYSON
Now, Anne, you remember how much 
it cost to get rid of that baseball 
player?

ANNE
You don't seem to understand that 
this one's different. He has brains.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

Grayson seats himself beside her on the divan.

GRAYSON
(fervently)
But what about me, Anne?

She looks at him coldly with almost an expression of 
dislike.

ANNE
You?  Oh, don't go serious on me, 
Dexter.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

INT. PENTHOUSE APT. - NIGHT

MED. SHOT TRUCKING

An elaborate, modernistic roof apartment, thronged with 
people all in evening dress. Stew and Anne are walking 
down among them. Anne is radiant, and Stew is happily 
guiding her among the stuffed shirts. Anne stops before a 
group. There is the sound of conversation, laughter, clink 
of glasses, music from stringed invisible orchestra, etc.

ANNE
Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith 
. . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, 
Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff

STEW
How-di-do.

GROUP
(ad-lib 
acknowledgements)

79. MED. CLOSE SHOT - DEXTER GRAYSON

Standing, helping himself to a cocktail, which a footman 
is passing about. Dexter looks off with a frown of 
disapproval.

80. CLOSE SHOT - GROUP OF WOMEN

They are looking off in Anne's direction.

FIRST WOMAN
Say, who's Anne's new boyfriend?

SECOND WOMAN
Well, if these old ears don't 
deceive me, I believe his name is 
Smith.

FIRST WOMAN
Smith! Can't be one of the brothers - 
he hasn't a beard on.[6]

SECOND WOMAN
Well, he must have something if 
Anne has got her clutches on him.

There is the sound of a piano chord being struck.

MED. FULL SHOT

Mrs. Baxter, the hostess, is standing importantly by the 
grand piano at which is seated an anaemic-looking young 
man. Beside her stands a stout, swarthy Italian with 
bristling mustachios. Mrs. Baxter bows toward the swarthy 
one, who bends almost double in acknowledgement. There is 
a polite scattering of applause, and some of the guests 
seat themselves.

Martini starts to sing.

Unnoticed by the rest, Stew and Anne slip out of the door 
into the roof garden.

EXT. ROOF GARDEN

MED. FULL SHOT

A most beautiful, romantic spot. Rose trees in blossom, a 
vine-covered pergola, a splashing fountain, a few choice 
marble statues, low, deep chairs placed to make a gorgeous 
spot. Stew and Anne enter from the direction of the house. 
The garden is dark except for the lights from the interior 
of the house. From within, comes the voice of the singer 
rendering an extremely romantic, sentimental Italian love 
song. This will continue to the FADE OUT of the scene.

Stew and Anne walk, still hand in hand, toward the edge of 
the pergola where the shadows are deeper and where a couple 
of glorified steamer chairs are placed. There is a full 
moon overhead.

She leads him toward a waterfall effect, a glass partition 
down which water trickles. They go behind the dimly lit 
fountain and sit in a low, deep divan. We see them in 
silhouette as they go into a passionate embrace. All we 
hear is the faint voice of Martiniand the uninterrupted 
splashing of the fountain.

CUT TO:

CLOSEUP - ANNE & STEW

On divan, arms around each other.

STEW
Anne, pinch me, will you? Throw me 
out of here. Give me the air. Throw 
me out of this joint, will you?

Anne smiles happily and pinches his nose.

ANNE
Why should I? We're happy, aren't 
we, darling?

STEW
Throw me out - because I'm beginning 
to get goofy ideas, and they concern 
you, Anne.

ANNE
(passionately)
None of your ideas can be goofy, 
Stew, if they concern me.

STEW
(struggling)
My name is Smith - well, that you 
seem to have been able to stand 
for the last month. I'm white, 
male and over twenty-one. I've 
never been in jail - that is, not 
often. And I prefer Scotch to 
Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate 
peas, I like black coffee and I 
hate garters. I make seventy-five 
bucks a week and I've got eight 
hundred and forty-seven bucks in 
the bank - and - I don't know yet 
whether your eyes are blue or 
violet.

ANNE
(although he is 
very close to her)
That's because you're too far away, 
Stew.

Throughout his speech, Anne never takes her eyes off him. 
As he fumbles now, he turns. Their eyes meet. His 
overwhelming desire for Anne overcomes him.

He dismisses as futile his effort to be practical, sweeps 
her into his arms and kisses her passionately.

FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

INT. CITY ROOM OF MORNING POST - DAY

MEDIUM FULL SHOT

Typical atmosphere, as before.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

85. MEDIUM SHOT

Featuring Stew at his desk, which is directly in front of 
the battery of Morkrums whose clatter comes into the sound 
track.

Stew finishes up a phone call. He sits at his desk, staring 
pensively at his typewriter. He is smoking a pipe and is 
in his shirt-sleeves. His hair is rumpled, and strewn over 
the desk is a bunch of crumpled up pieces of paper, 
indicating that he has made numerous unsuccessful starts 
at writing something. A fresh blank sheet of paper is now 
in the typewriter.

Nearby, at another desk, asleep in a swivel chair, with 
his feet elevated to the desk, the low snoring of another 
reporter blends with the sounds of the Morkrums and other 
noises of the City Room. At the reporter's elbow is a 
telephone.

86. MEDIUM SHOT

Desk of Conroy, the City Editor. A small upright plate on 
his desk indicates his position. This is near the copy 
desk. Characteristic activities are background for any 
action that may take place. Reporters come up to throw 
their stories on Conroy's desk; the phone rings, etc.

A boy comes in with a large number of newspapers under his 
arm which he throws on Conroy's desk. There are several 
copies of each of the rival newspapers in town. Conroy 
spreads them out and begins to examine them.

CLOSE SHOT - STEW

It is evident that he is nervous and jumpy about something. 
Finally he starts to pound the typewriter.

INSERT: Sheet of paper in typewriter on which is being 
typed.

ACT 1
SCENE 1

A STREET IN ARABY 88. CLOSE SHOT - GALLAGHER

As she talks on the phone to one of her girlfriends

GALLAGHER
(sotto voce)
Sure I got a new dress. A new hat 
too. (listens) Well, I'll try to 
get Stew to come with me. (she 
glances in his direction) Yeah - 
he's all right. You know, he thinks 
he's stuck on some society gal. 
(listens) Naw, it won't last. It 
better not last!

CLOSER SHOT - CONROY

Hastily glancing over the headlines of the papers. The 
phone rings. Without looking at it, Conroy answers:

CONROY
What? Oh, I'll be surprised, eh? 
Listen if there's any news in that 
sheet that I haven't thrown in the 
wastepaper basket, I'll eat it.

He is looking down at the papers and suddenly his eyes 
focus on something which causes the cigar to drop from his 
mouth and an expression of mingled amazement and rage comes 
into his face. We do not see at this point what it is he 
has read, but we know it must be something sensational. 
Abruptly he hangs up the phone.

CUT TO:

CONTINUATION SCENE 87

Stew, as he studies his typewriter. Over his CLOSEUP comes 
the excited outraged voice of Conroy.

CONROY'S VOICE
Hey Stew! Stew Smith!

A look of infinite weariness and disgust comes over Stew's 
face and he grits his teeth.

STEW
Me?

His general expression registers "Good god, there he goes 
again." With one finger he pounds out four letters:

INSERT: Sheet in typewriter: Next to

STREET IN ARABY

STEW HAS TYPED:

NUTS

He yanks the sheet out of the typewriter.

CONTINUATION SCENE 89

Conroy. He looks over and bellows furiously.

CONROY
You double-crossing hound! Come 
over here!

CONTINUATION SCENE 87

Stew gets up from his machine, crumples the sheet of paper 
into a wad and flings it at the sleeping reporter. The wad 
strikes him in the face; he wakes abruptly and automatically 
reaches for the phone. He picks up the receiver and in a 
voice fogged with sleep calls a number. Stew exits.

90. MEDIUM SHOT

At Conroy's desk. Conroy's expression is one of bitter 
reproach as he leans back in his swivel chair as Stew 
approaches and stands by the desk.

STEW
Now listen boss, if you're going 
to kick about that expense account

CONROY
(interrupting 
fiercely)
Do you call yourself a reporter?

91. MEDIUM SHOT

Of other reporters, the older man at the copy desk, and 
perhaps a sob sister or two nearby, who look up with 
expectant interest, expecting to hear Stew get a bawling 
out.

CLOSE SHOT - GALLAGHER

At her desk. She looks up worried and apprehensive.

CONTINUATION SCENE 90

Stew and Conroy.

STEW
It has been alleged - yes

CONROY
You wouldn't know news if you fell 
into a mess of it, nose first. So 
you're the bright lad that's never 
been scooped!

STEW
(defensively)
Not on my own beat, no.

CONROY
(howling so that he 
can be heard all 
over the room)
No? Well, where were you when that 
happened?

He slaps the copy of the Tribune furiously and shoves it 
into Stew's face.

CLOSE SHOT - STEW

Not knowing what it is all about, Stew, with an injured 
expression, takes the paper and looks at it.

INSERT: FRONT PAGE OF TRIBUNE

ANN SCHUYLER ELOPES WITH REPORTER

(with subheads giving more explicit information)

94. MEDIUM SHOT

The other reporters, copy readers, sob sisters, etc., seeing 
the unusual commotion and Stew's bewildered reaction, get 
out of their chairs and cross over to the City Desk, where 
they take up other copies of the same paper to look at. 
There are amazed and excited exclamations.

95. CLOSER SHOT - STEW AND CONROY

Stew, still staring dumbly at the paper. A few others are 
crowding around, glancing over his shoulder, etc.

CONROY
I've heard of people being scooped 
on their own funerals, but this!  
Holy mackerel! Why, it's news when 
Anne Schuyler gets her fingernails 
manicured, but this! She gets 
married to one of our own reporters 
and the Tribune beat us to it!
(he notices other 
reporters milling 
around)
Well! What do you guys want? Go 
on, get back to your desks. Go 
back to your work.
(returning his 
attention to Stew)
Now don't tell me you were drunk 
at the time and don't remember! Or 
is this one of Bingy's snow-storms?

STEW
No, no - it's true, all right, 
only we didn't want to get it in 
print yet, that's all.

CONROY
Why not?

STEW
Well, you see, I've acquired one 
of those new mother-in-laws, and 
we were afraid she wouldn't 
understand the whole idea. So we 
were going to wait till she went 
to Europe.

CONROY
What do I care about your mother-
in-law! You're still working for 
this paper, aren't you! Or are 
you?

STEW
Yes, sir.

CONROY
Well, it's your business to get 
news! And here you had a story 
right in your own lap and you let 
the Tribune scoop us on it. Making 
a first class Grade A monkey out 
of me. If it ever happens again - 
just don't bother about coming 
back. That's all.

He dismisses Stew with a wave of his hand.

STEW
Thanks for your congratulations.

96. MEDIUM SHOT

Stew turns away from Conroy's desk, and a group of his 
confreres come up, surrounding him in a series of ad-lib 
congratulations. (Some slightly profane, pounding him on 
the back, whooping, and in general manifesting great 
surprise and glee.) This group is increased by copy readers, 
office boys and everybody jabbering and shouting at him.

GROUP
(ad-lib 
congratulations)
Stew manages to break thru them 
and exits from scene.

97. MEDIUM SHOT

Gallagherto intercut with above scene. She gets up and 
goes over, CAMERA PANNING WITH HER and picks up another 
copy of the paper and reads the headlines.

CLOSER SHOT - GALLAGHER

Her face stricken and sick as she reads about Stew's 
marriage. Abruptly she turns away, out of scene.

99. MEDIUM SHOT

At Gallagher's empty desk. Stew comes in trying to stave 
off the mob. He turns on the congratulators, pushing them 
off.

STEW
What's the matter with you mugs? 
Can't a guy get married without 
all this?
(looks around)
Where's Gallagher? Anybody seen 
Gallagher?

He forcibly breaks away from them and walks back toward 
the door, the last of the wisecracks and goodnatured jeers 
being flung after him.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

INT. JOE'S SPEAKEASY

MED. CLOSE SHOT

Gallagher is seated alone at a table, looking very forlorn. 
Her life is suddenly empty. A drink is in front of her, 
untouched. She is fighting hard to keep her emotions under 
control.

Stew enters the speakeasy and mingles with patrons, who 
offer congratulations. He comes to a stop by the table. 
She looks up, forcing a smile.

STEW
Well, well, well! Gallagher, old 
pal! There you are. What did you 
run away for?

GALLAGHER
I didn't run away.

Stew draws out the other chair at the table and sits down.

CLOSER SHOT OF THE TWO

He looks across at her, grinning boyishly, utterly unaware 
that what he has done has hurt her deeply.

STEW
Sure, you ran away. Aren't you 
going to congratulate a guy?

GALLAGHER
(with sincerity)
Sure. I wish you all the luck in 
the world, pal.

She puts her hand tenderly on his.

STEW
Thanks, thanks.

GALLAGHER
I hope you'll be very happy.

Stew expands under the comradeship of Gallagher. He wants 
to talk.

STEW
Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's 
the matter with your eyes?

GALLAGHER
It's the smoke.

STEW
(calling to bartender)
Joe! A little snifter.
(returning his 
attention to 
Gallagher)
Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall 
into a girl like that, huh?
(he notices the 
newspaper, which 
Gallagher has been 
reading)
Look at that! I don't know how I 
rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's 
a swell girl. I want you to meet 
her.

GALLAGHER
Who me? She wouldn't want to meet 
me. I'm just an old load of hay.

CLOSE SHOT - STEW

As his drink is served.

STEW
Ah! Thank you, Joe.
(returning his 
attention to 
Gallagher)
Tell you what - we'll have one of 
those parties down at your house - 
one of those spaghetti parties, 
you know. Gee, we haven't had one 
of those in a long time, have we 
Gallagher?

CLOSE SHOT OF THE TWO

GALLAGHER
(quietly)
Not since you broke into society.

STEW
(waxing reminiscent)
Remember the time we had a spaghetti 
party, and while I was serving the 
spaghetti I dropped it on the floor, 
and while those mugs weren't 
looking, I picked it up and served 
it to them anyway! Remember that? 
Yes, Anne would love that.

CLOSE SHOT - GALLAGHER

Looking across at him.

GALLAGHER
Do you think your wife would walk 
up three flights of stairs just to 
eat out of paper plates?

105. DOUBLE SHOT

STEW
Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love 
that.

GALLAGHER
Remember, she's a Schuyler.

STEW
Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. 
That's the name.

GALLAGHER
(murmurs)
My error.

STEW
Well, if she doesn't want to come, 
I'll come down alone.

GALLAGHER
(shaking her head)
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're 
a married man now. Mother always 
warned me never to run around with 
married men.

STEW
(resentfully)
Say, what kind of a pal are you? 
You're not going to leave me flat?

Gallagher tries to be elaborately casual.

GALLAGHER
Oh, I'll call you up some time. 
And if your social duties permit - 
why -

STEW
Cut that out. Just because I'm 
married - there's no reason for 
that.

Gallagher looks up and off, seeing something that startles 
her.

106. MED. SHOT

Conroy, the City Editor, entering the speakeasy.

CONTINUATION SCENE 105

Stew and Gallagher.

GALLAGHER
(interrupting in a 
whisper)
Hey, ixnay - here's the ossbay. 
Stew looks around, also startled.

107. MED. SHOT

Stew buries his head in the newspaper, in pretense of 
looking for something. Conroy appears at the table and 
stops. He indicates Stew.

CONROY
What's the Benedict looking for in 
the newspaper - his lost freedom?

Stew slowly sticks his head up over the top of the table, 
looking up.

STEW
(grinning sheepishly)
Well, if it isn't old Fagin[9] 
himself.

Conroy sits down at the table.

STEW
Gallagher and myself just came 
over here to do a little work on a

CONROY
(disgustedly)
Baloney!
(calls off)
Joe! Bring me a special!

CLOSER THREE SHOT

Gallagher tries to be very bright and smiling.

GALLAGHER
(to Conroy)
Isn't it swell about Stew's 
marriage?

CONROY
(looking straight 
at her)
Is it?

Gallagher, self-conscious, realizes this tough old buzzard 
is on to her. She looks back at him for a moment - then 
drops her head. Stew is oblivious to this by-play. Conroy 
turns to Stew.

CONROY
Well, when are you quitting?

STEW
Quitting? I'm not thinking about 
quitting.

Joe comes in with a drink for Conroy.

CONROY
take it you don't have to work for 
a living any more

He takes a sip of his drink and looks over meaningfully.

CONROY
Mr. Schuyler .

STEW
(in a flash of anger)
Now get this, Conroy. My name is 
Smith. Always was Smith - and always 
gonna be Smith.

CONROY
Is that so?

STEW
That's so.

CLOSEUP - CONROY

He shows that he is genuinely interested in Stew and his 
problems, but can't help being a little sarcastic.

CONROY
Anne Schuyler's in the Blue Book - 
you're not even in the phone book. 
Think that one over, sucker.

CAMERA PANS to CLOSEUP of GALLAGHER.

GALLAGHER
(quickly in Stew's 
defense)
That doesn't make any difference

(QUIETLY)
if they love each other.

CAMERA PANS BACK to CLOSEUP of CONROY.

CONROY
Blah! It's like a giraffe marrying 
a monkey.
(looking off at 
Stew)
Listen - you'll never be anything 
but just the reporter that married 
the Schuyler's millions. Stew Smith 
is dead and buried. From now on, 
you'll be just Anne Schuyler's 
husband. A rich wife's magnolia. 
If you can smoke that without 
getting sick, you're welcome to 
it.

CAMERA PANS to CLOSEUP of STEW:

GALLAGHER'S VOICE
But that's perfectly ridiculous.

STEW
(defensively)
Wait a minute. Now, Gallagher, let 
me do the talking. Get this, Conroy - 
Anne Schuyler has got a lot of 
dough, all right - and I married 
her, all right - but her dough and 
me? No connection.

MED. CLOSE THREE SHOT

Gallagher is looking fixedly at Stew - very much worried 
about Conroy's dismal prophecies. Conroy shakes his head 
in sorrowful gloom.

CONROY
(as if he had not 
heard Stew)
Just a boid in a gilded cage -

STEW
A what?

CONROY
You heard me. A bird in a gilded 
cage.

STEW
Aw, you've been reading a lot of 
cheap tabloids. Anne and myself 
are going to move downtown in a 
nice little flat, we're gonna forget 
all about this social stuff, and 
we're gonna be known as Mr. and 
Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like 
that?

CONROY
(sarcasm)
And live on your salary, I suppose?

STEW
Yeah, live on my salary - that is, 
until I finish writing my play.

CONROY
(snorts)
What play?

STEW
My play.

CONROY
The one about the Siberian 
bloodhound?

STEW
Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's 
been all rewritten. It's laid in 
Araby now.

CONROY
Araby?

STEW
Sure.

CONROY
Araby, my eye!

111. WIDER SHOT

Conroy, having finished his drink, pushes back his chair 
and rises. He puts an affectionate hand on Stew's shoulder.

CONROY
Well, I'm sorry to see a good 
reporter go blooey
(starts away)
Let me know when you're quitting.

STEW
I'm not quitting!

CONROY
No?

STEW
No!

CONROY
(singing)
'For he's only a bird in a gilded 
cage, a beautiful sight to see'
(he waves his hand)
Tweet, tweet - ha, ha

He laughs loud and raucously and exits.

112. CLOSE SHOT - STEW AND GALLAGHER

Stew glares after Conroy.

STEW
(under his breath)
Laugh - laugh, you hyena!

Gallagher realizes that Conroy has hit home with the truth 
and is sorry for Stew. She puts her hand over his 
sympathetically.

GALLAGHER
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. 
He doesn't know what he's talking 
about.

STEW
Pay attention? I'm not paying any 
attention to him. You think that 
guy could get me upset? Hah! Not 
that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, 
cynical. He doesn't know the fine 
things in life - that guy.
(he swirls his drink, 
thinking)
A bird in a gilded cage, huh?  
It's getting so a guy can't step 
out without being called a magnolia. 
Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. 
Say, I'm not going to hang around 
and be a speakeasy rat all my life! 
I'll tell you that. Not me, not 
me. I'm going to step out and mean 
something in this world. You watch 
me.
(he swirls his drink, 
clearly bothered, 
lost in his own 
thoughts)
Say, am I a lucky guy to be near 
Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with 
a carload of horseshoes, and believe 
me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm 
lucky!
(pause)
Don't you think I'm lucky, 
Gallagher?

GALLAGHER
Sure - I think so, Stew.

STEW
I knew you would, pal.
(clearly bothered)
A bird in a gilded cage, eh?

GALLAGHER
How is her family going to feel 
about it?

STEW
Her family? Oh, they'll be all 
right. I'll bring them around.
(swirling his drink)
Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not 
marrying her family. Stew Smith in 
a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!
(clearly bothered)
That mug. What does he know?

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SCHUYLER DRAWING ROOM - DAY

MED. FULL SHOT

Another jury scene. This time it is Anne who's on the 
carpet. Grayson, in correct afternoon attire, his hands 
behind his back and his head sunk, is pacing back and forth 
in a very depressed and gloomy fashion.

Anne is seated, her demeanor betokening sullen defiance.

Michael is pacing, nervously smoking a cigarette.

MICHAEL
I don't know what you need me here 
for - it isn't my funeral.

Mrs. Schuyler stands by a table, staring at a spreadout 
newspaper which is laid out on the table. She flings the 
newspaper aside.

MRS. SCHUYLER
You stay right here, Michael. Some 
day you'll be head of this family, 
but thank heaven I shan't be here 
when it happens. And I hope you 
never have a daughter who gives 
you gastritis as Anne has me!

She pulls the bell rope for the butler.

ANNE
Now Mother, calm yourself. There's 
no use in getting so excited.

114. MEDIUM SHOT

Mrs. Schuyler is vastly agitated.

MRS. SCHUYLER
Oh, isn't there?
(as Anne starts to 
get up)
Sit down!
(looking off)
Smythe!

The butler appears in the doorway.

MRS. SCHUYLER
(in a weak, agonized 
voice)
Some bicarbonate - quick!

SMYTHE
Double strength!

The butler bows and exits. She passes a nervous hand over 
her eyes. Anne comes up to her.

ANNE
Mother, if you keep this up, you'll 
have a nervous breakdown before 
you go to Europe.

115. CLOSER SHOT

Anne, Grayson and Mrs. Schuyler.

MRS. SCHUYLER
It's a good thing your father passed 
away before he saw insanity ravage 
the family. I can't imagine what 
made you do such a thing. A 
reporter! Of all things, a reporter! 
A barbarian who lets his socks 
come down!

ANNE
Mother, I promise you that he won't 
be a reporter much longer. Once I 
get him away from that atmosphere 
and get him away from a man named 
Gallagher

MRS. SCHUYLER
(as Anne starts to 
get up again)
Sit down!

116. WIDER SHOT

The butler enters with a tray on which is a glass of 
bicarbonate of soda and brings it to Mrs. Schuyler.  Walking 
immediately behind the butler is Stew, airily debonair. 
The butler glances somewhat uneasily at Mrs. Schuyler as 
he presents the tray. She glares blackly at Stew without a 
word of greeting, and taking the foaming glass from the 
tray, starts to lift it to her lips.

STEW
(airily)
Drink hearty, Mother.

Once more, Anne starts to rise out of her seat.

MRS. SCHUYLER
Anne!

Mrs. Schuyler pauses - glowering at Stew. Stew nods 
perfunctorily to each member of the jury, the total 
innocent.

STEW
Hello, Anne. Mr. Grayson.
(to Michael)
And you.
(to Mrs. Schuyler)
Mrs. Schuyler!

Grayson does not acknowledge the greeting. Mrs. Schuyler, 
having drained the glass, dismisses the butler with a wave 
of the hand, and directs her attention again to the matter 
at hand.

MRS. SCHUYLER
(in command)
Well, what's to be done? He's here 
now.

They are all silent - reluctant to speak in front of Stew. 
Stew looks at them all - a little puzzled - then he walks 
over toward Mrs. Schuyler.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Mrs. Schuyler and Stew.

STEW
Nobody seems to want to do anything
(to Mrs. Schuyler, 
brightly)
Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer 
a suggestion. Do what about what?

MRS. SCHUYLER
(witheringly)
About what? Your marriage to Anne!

STEW
(with a tone of 
dismissal)
Oh, my marriage to Anne. Now Mrs. 
Schuyler, we don't want you to go 
to any trouble about that. We just 
want the usual blessings, that's 
all.

118. MEDIUM SHOT

Mrs. Schuyler's eyes flash. She draws herself up with 
haughty dignity.

MRS. SCHUYLER
Young man, I want you to know that 
I object violently to this whole 
affair!

This finally brings Anne out of her seat. She rises and 
crosses to Stew, making a show of embracing him.

ANNE
Now Mother, your attitude is 
perfectly ridiculous. It's done 
now. Stewart and I are married.

STEW
(to Mrs. Schuyler)
I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. 
Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, 
Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this 
way. I was in hopes that you would 
like me. I'm not the burglar that 
you think I am. After all, we're 
married. I think the thing to do 
is to kiss and make up - Mother.

MRS. SCHUYLER
(furiously)
Stop calling me Mother!

STEW
(easily)
All right, Grandma

MRS. SCHUYLER
(glaring)
This man's impossible! I can't 
talk to him. Grayson, let's go 
where we can talk - hic!
(she emits a burp, 
then fixes a glacial 
look at Anne)
See what you've done to me!?

Without another word, she turns and flounces angrily out 
of the room. Grayson follows her. At the doorway he pauses, 
starts to say something. They all look at him expectantly - 
but no words come out.

STEW
Got it too, huh?

Grayson gives a harrumph and exits.

CLOSER MEDIUM SHOT

Anne, Michael and Stew. Michael grins at Stew.

MICHAEL
Who won that round?

Michael starts moving toward the door.

STEW
(ruefully)
I'm afraid your mother won that 
round - that is, she got in the 
last blow.

MICHAEL
I don't feel the way they do. You're 
really not as bad as everybody 
thinks.

STEW
(effusively - shaking 
his hand)
You're beginning to appreciate me, 
eh? Thanks!

MICHAEL
Don't worry too much about Mother - 
she's enjoying this. Come on 
upstairs, I'll give you a little -

He indicates a snifter, grins and exits. Anne crosses to 
Stew and puts her arm around his shoulder.

STEW
(to Michael)
A little? Sure, I'll be right up.
(to Anne)
He's all right. I like him.

ANNE
I'm glad.

He sees two figures pass above in a proscenium alcove, 
first Mrs. Schuyler, then Grayson. He makes an elaborate 
bow to each, and is impressed by Grayson's return bow.

STEW
He can bend!

120. CLOSER SHOT

Anne takes a step backwards and sits down with him on one 
of the divans. CAMERA TILTING DOWN WITH THEM. He puts an 
arm about her.

ANNE
Come here baby!

Anne starts fussing abstractedly at Stew's tie. They kiss.

ANNE
haven't seen you for three hours. 
You're neglecting me already

During her speech she has been picking away at a stain on 
his tie. Stew looks down and notices it.

STEW
What's the matter? Something I et, 
no doubt. Egg marks the spot

ANNE
You ought to get some new ties, 
Stewart.

STEW
I don't need any new ties. I've 
got another tie - I've got another 
one besides this one. And it's a 
pip, too. There's only one thing 
wrong with it. You know what that 
is?  It has a little weakness for 
gravy, and once in a while it leans 
a little toward ketchup. Of course 
that's only in its weaker moments. 
When you move down to my place, 
I'll show it to you.

Anne is somewhat taken aback at the suggestion that she's 
to move into his place.

ANNE
Your place?

TWO SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE

STEW
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it 
doesn't compare with this coliseum 
of yours here, but 'twill serve 
m'lady, 'twill serve.
(elaborate)
The architecture has a little 
feeling of Missouri Gothic - and 
the furniture sort of leans toward 
Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny 
touch of Grand Rapids.

ANNE
(gently insistent)
Don't you think it's silly of us 
to think of living there when we 
have this whole big house

STEW
When 'we' . . .?  You mean, you'd 
like to have me live here in your 
house?

Anne cuddles closer into his collar.

ANNE
Sure. We can have the whole left 
wing and be all by ourselves all 
the time.

Stew is slightly dazed.

CLOSEUP - STEW

He is slightly dazed.

STEW
(cynically)
We could have the whole left wing? 
Wouldn't that be nice! Would that 
be room enough for us?

123. TWO SHOT

ANNE
(seriously - missing 
his sarcasm)
Oh darling, of course it would. If 
it isn't - there are six rooms and 
two baths - but if that isn't 
enough, Mother will give us the 
blue room too, I think.

STEW
Oh, Mother will give us the blue 
room. You haven't a red room, have 
you?  Well, bless her heart. 
Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - 
six rooms and two baths and a blue 
room. I guess she would let us 
have the right wing if we needed 
it, wouldn't she?

ANNE
But we don't need it, I'm sure.

STEW
I see, we won't need that. Plenty 
of room, plenty of room.

124. WIDER SHOT

He gets up and paces the floor. He looks at Anne and sees 
that she is taking him seriously. He drops down beside 
her.

STEW
(dropping his kidding)
Look Anne, you're not serious about 
this, are you?

ANNE
Of course I am Stewart.

CLOSER TWO SHOT

STEW
Now let's get this settled

She cuddles closer, tweaking his nose.

ANNE
You have the cutest nose I've

STEW
Never mind my nose. What kind of a 
chump do you think I am? You think 
I'm going to live here in your 
house - on your dough?  What do 
you think my friends would all 
say? Don't be silly. I'd get the 
razzing of my life for that. 'A 
bird in a gilded cage' - that's 
what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not 
me!

ANNE
What do you think my friends would 
say if they found me in a little 
cheap flat?

STEW
It isn't cheap. It's nice.

ANNE
(cuddling closer)
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk 
about things like that now

STEW
Wait a minute. I'll do anything 
you ask me, Anne, but I will not 
live

ANNE
(cuddling closer - 
and stroking his 
nose)
Oh, I love that nose. It's such a 
sweet nose.

They kiss.

STEW
Nevertheless, whether the nose is 
sweet or not, I'm not going to 
live in your house. You may as 
well get that straight.

They kiss again, longer.

STEW
You do want me to be happy, don't 
you? Then I'm not going to live in 
your house . . .

They continue to kiss as . . .

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

INT. STEW'S BEDROOM - MORNING

CLOSE SHOT - STEW

In bed, asleep, all curled up, his head on his arm. CAMERA 
TRUCKS BACK showing the magnificent bedroom, with carved 
wooden panellings, a raised, canopied bed. The clothes 
that Stew has taken off the night before are draped 
haphazardly about the room. When the Camera gets to a point 
that takes in a LONG SHOT of the room, the door to the 
hall opens and a correctly attired valet appears. He closes 
the door noiselessly, goes over to the windows, and draws 
the brocaded drapes aside. Then he crosses to a covered 
object and with a small flourish removes the cover - 
revealing a birdcage. He approaches the bed.

127. CLOSER SHOT

As Dawson the valet stops beside the bed. The valet leans 
over and speaks distinctly.

DAWSON
Mr. Smith, sir

There is no movement from the form on the bed.

DAWSON
Mr. Smith, sir!

Still no response. The valet taps the bedclothes-shrouded 
shoulder gently.

DAWSON
Mr. Smith, sir

Sleepily, Stew turns, his eyes heavy with sleep.

128. MEDIUM SHOT

DAWSON
How do you like your bath, sir?

STEW
I like my bath all right. How do 
you like your bath?

Stew peers up, puzzled.

STEW
Who are you?

DAWSON
(surprised)
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the 
name, sir.

STEW
You're my what?

DAWSON
Your valet, sir.

Stew still stares at him. Then he nods to himself - thinks 
he gets the idea. Stew kicks back the covers and sits on 
the edge of the bed in his pajamas. Still sitting on the 
edge of the bed, he starts to slip his feet into a pair of 
slippers. The valet bends on one knee to help him.

STEW
Thank you, thank you, thank you! 
I'll do that for you some time. 
That's very sweet. Say listen, 
what did you say your name was?

DAWSON
Dawson, sir.

STEW
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last 
night?

DAWSON
Drunk, sir?

Stew rises and starts to reach for a dressing gown, but 
again the valet beats him to it - holding it for him and 
helping him slip into it.

STEW
Yes. I must have been pretty much 
plastered if I hired a valet.

DAWSON
Oh, but you didn't engage me, sir.

Stew, surprised, turns on him quickly.

STEW
Who did engage you then, if I didn't 
engage you? What are you doing 
with my pants

The valet picks up his pants.

STEW
Did you take anything out of those 
pants?

DAWSON
Oh no, sir!

STEW
What are you doing fooling around 
in here?

DAWSON
Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - 
she engaged me this morning, sir.

Stew pulls out a cigarette. The valet, without missing a 
beat, leans over and offers a light. A wary Stew accepts.

STEW
Hmmm. So Mrs. Smith engaged me a 
valley, huh? That's very nice of 
Mrs. Smith - to engage me a valley.

129. WIDER SHOT

Stew walks over and gets a cigarette out of a box on a 
small table, waving his hand in a gesture of dismissal. 
The valet is right behind him, holding up his bathrobe for 
Stew to step into.

STEW
(putting on the 
bathrobe)
Say, you are nice. You're all right. 
You'd make a good wife.

DAWSON
Thank you, sir.

STEW
But not for me!  Though I like you 
well enough. You're a nice fellow. 
You're all right. But I'm sorry I 
don't need any valleys today.

The valet pays no attention to him, but walks around the 
room, picking up the clothes that Stew has flung about.

DAWSON
Oh, but indeed you do, sir, if you 
don't mind my saying so. A 
gentleman's gentleman, as it were. 
Someone to draw your bath, lay out 
your clothes, help to dress you - 
it's really most essential, sir.

Stew, with his cigarette between his lips, stands watching 
the valet as he retrieves the various articles of cast-off 
clothing. The valet's manner is somewhat patronizing. He 
walks over to a chifferobe and starts opening the drawers, 
preparatory to laying out fresh things for Stew. Suddenly, 
Stew stalks over to him, takes him by the shoulder, and 
yanks him around to face him.

130. CLOSER SHOT - STEW AND DAWSON

The valet is astonished and somewhat alarmed at the 
belligerent expression on Stew's face.

STEW
(over-sweetly)
Are you trying to tell me that I 
need someone to help me put on my 
pants and button them up?

DAWSON
Quite so. Quite.

STEW
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your 
efforts. But I don't need anybody 
to help me button my pants - I've 
been buttoning my pants for thirty 
years all right, and I can button 
'em with one hand as a matter of 
fact.

DAWSON
Now Mr. Smith, now please

Stew is rapidly losing his temper.

STEW
You've got a nice face, Dawson, 
you wouldn't want anything to happen 
to your face, would you?

The valet puts a bewildered hand to his face.

DAWSON
Oh no, sir

Stew releases him with a definite motion toward the door.

STEW
All right, outside!

DAWSON
(bewildered)
I beg your pardon, sir?

STEW
(gesturing violently)
Outside!

The valet gazes at Stew as if he thinks the man is insane. 
He is considerably alarmed.

DAWSON
I think I understand, sir. You 
mean you want me to go?

STEW
(smiling admiringly)
There you are. You caught on. You 
see, you're nice and you're smart 
too. You caught on right away. 
Outside! Go on! Outside! And don't 
come back!

131. MEDIUM SHOT

The valet starts edging toward the door.

DAWSON
No, sir. No!

Stew's eyes bulge as he notices the birdcage for the first 
time.

STEW
Wait a minute, what's this?

INSERT: Birdcage.

BACK TO SCENE:

DAWSON
That's a canary, sir.

STEW
That's a canary! Who brought that 
in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get 
that out of here. Get that out of 
here!

DAWSON
(frightened)
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.

STEW
(ranting)
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! 
Get that thing out of here!

DAWSON
Yes sir!

The valet hurries off, carrying the birdcage. As he nears 
the door, there is a light tap on the door connecting Stew's 
room and Anne's. The door opens and Anne comes in, wearing 
a ravishing and revealing negligee. She carries a small 
jeweler's box in her hand. She crosses the room toward 
Stew.

ANNE
Good morning, darling.

She looks over and sees Dawson at the hall door.

ANNE
Oh, Dawson, see that all Mr. Smith's 
clothes go to the cleaners this 
morning, please, will you?

The valet bows. Stew looks at her blankly.

DAWSON
Very good, madame.

He closes the door discreetly and goes out.

132. CLOSER SHOT - ANNE AND STEW

As they hug.

STEW
Say, who is this mug?

Anne sits down on the rumpled bed.

ANNE
I've got a present. Shut your eyes. 
Keep 'em closed. I know you're 
going to love them.

STEW
(eyes closed, feeling 
the package)
Little - couldn't be an automobile, 
could it?
(he opens the package)
Well, well! Ain't that nice!

He holds them up - expensive garters.

ANNE
Do you like them?

STEW
Got my initials on them too. They're 
cute. They're nice little things - 
what do you do with them?

ANNE
You wear them of course, silly.

STEW
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't 
worn these things for Years.

ANNE
I know that.

STEW
Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't 
look Gallagher in the face.

ANNE
Darling, I don't care whether you 
can look Gallagher in the face or 
not, but you're gonna be a good 
boy and wear garters.

STEW
Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach 
for you. I'll go to the dentist 
twice a year for you. I'll wash 
behind my ears for you. But I will 
never wear garters!

His arms go about Anne. Under the force of his embrace 
Anne sinks back on the pillows. Stew leans forward looking 
down at her.

133. CLOSE TWO SHOT - STEW AND ANNE

Nose to nose.

ANNE
(adopting a sing-
song)
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes 
you will my dear - you'll wear 
garters and you'll like it too!

STEW
(picking up her 
sing-song)
Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I 
won't my dear - I'll wash behind 
my ears, but no I won't my dear!

He bends to kiss her again, but she gently resists, and 
continues the sing-song.

ANNE
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes 
you will my dear - you'll eat 
spinach but you'll wear garters 
too!

STEW
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you 
can't carry a tune - all you are 
good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. 
Oh no, I won't wear garters

ANNE
Oh yes you will wear garters

They melt into each other's arms.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CITY ROOM OF NEWSPAPER OFFICE - DAY

MEDIUM FULL SHOT

General activity, as before.

CAMERA TRUCKS DOWN THE MAIN AISLE until it centers on Stew 
at his desk, sitting low in his chair, his feet cocked up 
on the corner of his desk, reading a newspaper CAMERA TRUCKS 
UP CLOSER centering on his feet on the desk. One trouser 
leg is pulled slightly up and reveals a garter.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Stew, reading the newspaper. It is opened up before his 
face.

INSERT: Headlines - about a three-column article:

ANNE SCHUYLER AND CINDERELLA HUBBY TO OCCUPY SCHUYLER 
MANSION

As Stew reads this, he looks very glum and depressed.

136. MEDIUM SHOT

A reporter, the one Stew had socked with a wad of paper in 
an earlier sequence, shambles past and stops abruptly, 
staring at Stew's feet.

INSERT: Of what he sees. Stew's feet. The socks are 
strangely taut.

BACK TO SCENE:

The reporter glances up and sees that Stew cannot see him, 
and then carefully lifts Stew's trouser leg a few inches.

INSERT: Stew's feet and legs. As the reporter's hand lifts 
the trouser leg, the fancy solid-gold garters are on full 
display.

BACK TO SCENE:

The reporter stares at them goggle-eyed. He can hardly 
contain himself at the sight of the garters. He looks off:

REPORTER
(cautiously)
Psst!

137. WIDER SHOT

One or two other reporters hear him and look over curiously. 
The reporter looks very mysterious and important and makes 
a motion for silence and caution. They get up and cross on 
tip-toe to join him.

138. MEDIUM SHOT

The men around Stew. They quietly gather around his feet 
and the reporter who made the discovery proudly displays 
his find. One or two more step by and all stare. Stew still 
has the paper up in front of his face.

FIRST REPORTER
Is it real?

2ND REPORTER
Of course it's real!

3RD REPORTER
Any diamonds on them?

REPORTER
Musta set him back at least six 
bits.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Stew. (Camera behind him and shooting over his head.) He 
is suddenly attracted by this unusual conversation and 
lowers his paper, revealing the group of six or seven men 
in a huddle round his feet.

2ND REPORTER
One just can't wear those and be 
decent.

3RD REPORTER
Yes you can, if you belong to the 
Four Hundred.[12]

2ND REPORTER
I wonder what number he is.

Stew flares in anger. Several of them are bending low to 
get a close peek. With a violent gesture, Stew kicks his 
foot forward and sends a couple of them sprawling. Stew 
gets to his feet.

STEW
Go on, get out of there! What's 
the matter with you mugs? Didn't 
you ever see a guy with a pair of 
garters on before?

140. MEDIUM SHOT

The two reporters who have done most of the talking scramble 
to their feet. The second reporter speaks in mock 
perplexity.

REPORTER
What do you suppose he wears them 
for?

2ND REPORTER
Can it be possible to hold his 
socks up?

3RD REPORTER
Yeah, exactly.
(effeminately)
You know, one's hose look horribly 
untidy when they hang loose-like, 
don't you think so, percifield?

Stew gets up as his phone rings. He pays no attention to 
it. Hank, another reporter, answers.

4TH REPORTER
(same effeminacy)
Yes, my dear chap - they look 
ghastly - they look ghastly!

STEW
Go on! Screw! Get out of here!

He starts out when Hank calls to him:

HANK
Hey, Stew!

Stew turns.

HANK
(indicating phone)
Your policeman!

Stew comes back and, frowning, picks up the phone.

141. CLOSE SHOT

Stew at phone.

STEW
Hello? Oh hello dear. Wait just a 
minute
(to reporters, 
hovering around)
Come on! Beat it, will you? Screw! 
Screw! This is my wife! In your 
respective chapeaux and over your 
cauliflower ears.

INT. ANNE'S BEDROOM

CLOSEUP - ANNE

She is lying on her stomach on a rubbing table, as used by 
a masseuse. We see a considerable part of her back, on 
which a middle-aged Swedish masseuse is industriously 
working. Anne has the telephone in her hand. Throughout 
her scene, we hear very telling whacks:

ANNE
(into phone)
But it's nearly six o'clock darling, 
and you know how long it takes you 
to dress.
(pause)
But the Ambassador is coming at 
eight, and you've got to be ready

wear.

INT. CORRIDOR SCHUYLER HOME

145. Gallagher is just entering. Smythe holds door open 
for her.

GALLAGHER
I'd like to see Miss Wilson, please.

SMYTHE
Who shall I say, madam?

GALLAGHER
Miss Gallagher of the Post.

SMYTHE
Yes, miss.

He leaves.

INT. SCHUYLER RECEPTION HALL

MOSS AND FONTANA are doing a beautiful tango. Guests 
scattered around the room, watching interestedly.

CUT BACK TO:

INT. CORRIDOR SCHUYLER HOME

Gallagher is still waiting. Smythe enters, leading Miss 
Wilson, a refined-looking girl of 26 or so, her hand 
extended.

SMYTHE
Miss Gallagher of the Post.

MISS WILSON
Oh yes - of course. Miss Gallagher?

GALLAGHER
Yes.

MISS WILSON
I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's 
social secretary.

GALLAGHER
I was sent from the Post in place 
of our social editor.

MISS WILSON
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey 
telephoned me. Well, what would 
you like to have?

GALLAGHER
Why, a list of the guests. That's 
the usual thing, isn't it?

MISS WILSON
Yes, of course. I'll get it for 
you

(SMILING)
In the meantime, would you like to 
take a look around?

GALLAGHER
Yes, thank you.

The CAMERA MOVES WITH THEM as they start for the Reception 
Room.

MISS WILSON
That's a lovely dress.

GALLAGHER
Thank you.
(pause)
Where is Mr. Smith?

MISS WILSON
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann 
Schuyler's husband?

GALLAGHER
Yes.

MISS WILSON
He's probably very tired. You see, 
he's had to meet all these people 
personally tonight.

GALLAGHER
I bet.

MISS WILSON
You newspaper people have a lot of 
fun with him, don't you? What is 
it you call him - the Cinderella 
Man?

CUT TO:

INT. ENTRANCE OF BALLROOM

Moss and Fontana are just finishing their dance. Gallagher 
stands in doorway with Miss Wilson, watching them. Excited 
voices comment on the dance. Miss Wilson beckons to 
Gallagher to follow her.

CAMERA TRUCKS with them as they weave in and out of crowd. 
Miss Wilson points out celebrated guests to her.

MISS WILSON
There's the Spanish Ambassador.

Gallagher steals a glance at the celebrated gentleman.

GALLAGHER
You know, he looks like one.

Miss Wilson laughs delightedly. At this point they are 
interrupted by a butler.

149. MEDIUM SHOT

BUTLER
Miss Wilson

MISS WILSON
Yes?

BUTLER
Mrs. Smith would like to see you.

MISS WILSON
(to Gallagher)
Will you excuse me? Make yourself 
at home for just a moment, please.

GALLAGHER
Thanks.

Miss Wilson follows butler out of scene. Gallagher is left 
alone. She wanders about the huge ballroom, peering here 
and there, searching for Stew. Finally she comes to a large 
open French door and steps out.

INT. TERRACE LEADING OFF SCHUYLER BALLROOM

Several groups of men and women are seated at tables. 
Gallagher enters from ballroom, glances quickly at all the 
men. Disappointed at not finding Stew, she crosses terrace 
and descends broad stone steps and advances into garden.

INT. SECLUDED SPOT IN GARDEN

Stew, his head cupped in his hands, is seated on a stone 
bench. Gallagher wanders into scene. She sees Stew and 
stops. Stew does not move. Gallagher, with a happy smile 
on her lips, moves closer to him. Stew suddenly becomes 
conscious of someone near him and looks suddenly up. He 
sees Gallagher; his face breaks into a happy grin.

GALLAGHER
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your 
plays and I'd like an autograph.

STEW
Well, well! If it isn't my old 
friend! Turn around, gal! Let's 
get a look at you.

GALLAGHER
There you are!

CLOSER SHOT OF THE TWO

STEW
Well, daughter of the slums - how 
did you get out of the ghetto?

GALLAGHER
I'm pinch-hitting for our society 
editor tonight. I wanted to see 
some life in the raw.

STEW
Aw, you wanted to see some life in 
the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid 
we ain't got no raw life up here.

GALLAGHER
Well, I'll have to look someplace 
else.

STEW
No, no! Maybe we could interest 
you in some well done butterflies, 
or perhaps some slightly fried 
pansies, or better still, some 
stuffed shirts. And guaranteed 
every one of them will give you a 
good stiff pain in the neck.

GALLAGHER
(fixing his tie)
Say, who's been tying your ties 
lately? It looks rotten.

He suddenly realizes there's something different about 
Gallagher. He takes a step back so as to look her over 
carefully - blinks his eyes.

STEW
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! 
What are you doing to yourself?

GALLAGHER
Nothing.

STEW
What did you do to that hair? And 
where did you get that dress?

GALLAGHER
I dyed one and washed the other.

STEW
(enthusiastically)
Oh, you dyed one and washed the 
other. Well! You certainly look 
good.

153. ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDEN

Anne is walking in direction of Stew and Gallagher. She 
stops suddenly when she sees them. Her body stiffens.

CUT BACK TO:

ANOTHER SHOT - STEW AND GALLAGHER

From Anne's angle. Gallagher is facing in the direction of 
Anne.

GALLAGHER
Don't turn around now - but there's 
a very beautiful girl up there who 
seems to be staring at us.

STEW
Staring at us?

GALLAGHER
My mistake - she's glaring.

STEW
Must be my wife.

He turns - sees Anne.

STEW
It is my wife. Hi Anne. Don't go 
away. Stay right there, because 
I'm going to bring a friend up I 
want you to meet.

They exit.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - ANNE

Standing as before. She is looking off with slightly 
narrowed eyes. Stew and Gallagher come up to her.

STEW
Anne, prepare yourself for the 
treat of your life. This is 
Gallagher.

ANNE
(astounded)
Gallagher!

STEW
Sure - my pal on the paper. She's 
subbing for the society editor 
tonight.

Anne turns an acid smile on the uncomfortable Gallagher.

CLOSER THREE SHOT

ANNE
Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?

STEW
Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.

Anne winces slightly at this name.

GALLAGHER
How do you do?

There is a short, awkward pause.

ANNE
(bitter-sweet)
You know, Stewart, you failed to 
mention that Miss Gallagher was a 
very beautiful young girl.

STEW
Gallagher?

Gallagher flashes a look at Stew - seeing that he fails to 
get the dynamite behind Anne's casually pleasant phrases. 
Anne plunges ahead. Her tone is unmistakable now.

ANNE
Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed 
to mention that Gallagher was a 
girl.

STEW
(surprised)
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it 
funny?

ANNE
(with a world of 
meaning)
Yes - isn't it?

156. CLOSE SHOT - STEW AND ANNE

Stew is beginning to realize that all is not well as it 
could be.

STEW
You see, we never look at Gallagher 
as a girl

He breaks off.

ANNE
(with her eyes on 
Gallagher)
No? What do you look upon her as?

STEW
(fumbling for words)
Why, down at the office, we always 
look at Gallagher as - eh - just 
Gallagher, that's all.

CAMERA PANS QUICKLY TO CLOSE SHOT of GALLAGHER. She tries 
to back Stew up.

GALLAGHER
(not so comfortable 
herself)
They all consider me just as one 
of the boys.

STEW
Right!

MED. SHOT OF THE THREE

ANNE
(a deadly acid smile)
Indeed? How interesting.

GALLAGHER
(same kind of smile)
Yes - isn't it.

Anne takes Stew's arm, drawing him away from Gallagher.

ANNE
Miss Wilson will give you the guest 
list and any other details you may 
need, Miss Gallagher.

GALLAGHER
(resenting the tone 
of dismissal)
Thank you. I'll go and look for 
her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.

ANNE
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.

GALLAGHER
Goodbye, Stew

She leaves scene.

158. MED. CLOSE SHOT - STEW AND ANNE

Stew turns and faces her.

STEW
That was kind of a rotten thing to 
do, Anne. After all, Gallagher is 
my friend. The least you can do is 
be courteous to her.

ANNE
I thought I was very charming, 
Stewart.

STEW
You did? That's a lot of hooey! 
I'll go and apologize.

He promptly walks away from her in Gallagher's direction.

ANNE
(furious)
Stewart, please!

She glares angrily at the departing Stew.

EXT. TERRACE

159. CLOSE SHOT

Gallagher has just reached the ballroom when Stew catches 
up to her.

STEW
I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I 
am sorry.

GALLAGHER
(reassuringly)
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget 
it. As far as she's concerned, I'm 
just part of the hired help.

STEW
No, no. Strange, I've never seen 
Anne act that way before. (pause) 
It's funny I never thought to tell 
her you were a girl, isn't it?

GALLAGHER
Yes.

INT. SCHUYLER ENTRANCE HALL

MED. CLOSE SHOT

The butler is just opening the door. Bingy, looking more 
disreputable than usual, steps inside.

BINGY
Hello, there, Meadows![13]

SMYTHE
(disapproving once-
over)
Who is it you wish to see, sir?

BINGY
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse 
me - I mean Mr. Smith.

SMYTHE
Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. 
We are having a reception here 
this evening

BINGY
Oh, a party! Great, great! Jolly 
times and merry pranks. That's me. 
I'm a guy who loves parties. You 
know

He is distracted by two elegantly-dressed ladies strolling 
by.

BINGY
a beautiful pair of shoulders!  
But listen now, as a favor, will 
you please make it snappy, Laughing 
Waters,[14] and tell Stew Smith I 
gotta see him because if you don't 
my whole family's going to die.

SMYTHE
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. 
Have a seat.

BINGY
Well, I got a seat, but I have no 
place to put it.

The butler turns to leave, then turns back, his face 
expressing distinct disapproval.

SMYTHE
Pardon me, sir, but I've heard 
that one before.

INT. SCHUYLER BALLROOM

161. CLOSE SHOT

Stew and Gallagher standing together. The butler is seen 
leaving the scene, having just informed Stew of Bingy's 
presence at the reception.

STEW
(to Gallagher)
Excuse me. I just want to make 
sure and see he doesn't take away 
any of the vases.
(starts to leave, 
then turns back)
Well, well, well! My little pal, 
Gallagher, a girl, huh?
(unexpectedly, he 
bends to kiss her 
hand tenderly)
That's just to give you an idea 
that I know how to treat a gal.  
Get fresh with me and I'll sock 
you in that little nose of yours. 
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

He exits. Gallagher is left staring at her hand wonderingly.

INT. SCHUYLER ENTRANCE HALL

162. MED. SHOT

Bingy gets up from his throne chair, and crosses into the 
doorway of the library opposite him. He stops by a carved 
low-boy, and curiously examines a large antique vase.  
Stew comes in and stops with a smile as he sees him.

Bingy, his hand on the vase, looks up. Stew walks over to 
him.

STEW
(referring to vase)
What's the matter, Bingy, a little 
clumsy to get in your pocket?

Bingy sets down the vase and surveys him.

BINGY
No. I was just looking at it. 
Pretty, ain't it? I was just looking 
for the price tag.

INT. SCHUYLER LIBRARY

CLOSER SHOT OF THE TWO

Bingy looks him up and down in silent, insolent scrutiny. 
Stew begins to burn.

STEW
What do you want?

BINGY
Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I 
wanted to see how the old newshound 
looked made up for a gentleman.

STEW
(sore)
Would you like to have me turn 
around for you, Bingy?

BINGY
Oh boy, I'd love it.

Stew makes a complete turn and faces Bingy again.

STEW
How's that?

BINGY
(appraisingly)
Not bad - not good - but not bad. 
You ought to be able to fool about 
almost anybody.

STEW
Is that so? Well, have you seen 
enough - or would you like a 
photograph?

BINGY
A photograph? What's the matter? 
Hasn't mama had you done in oils 
yet?
(singing)
"Just A Gigolo . . . "

STEW
Now get this mug. You've got the 
kind of chin I just love to touch.  
And if you don't get out of here, 
I'm going to hang one right on it.

Bingy assumes a conciliatory attitude.

BINGY
Take it easy! Take it easy, Dempsey. 
Just relax, my boy, relax and open 
your pores.

CLOSER TWO SHOT

Stew glares at him. Bingy goes on.

BINGY
I bring a message from Garcia.

STEW
Yeah?

BINGY
Yeah. The boss sent me over to 
offer you a job. He wants you to 
write a daily column on the Tribune.

STEW
(skeptically)
Yeah - go on.

BINGY
It's all right. You can write your 
own ticket. A hundred and fifty 
bucks a week.

STEW
(thinks a bit - 
quietly)
I'll bite. What's the catch?

BINGY
There's no catch. This is on the 
up and up. Of course all you have 
to do is just sign the article - 
by Anne Schuyler's Husband.

165. MED. SHOT

Taking in the doorway. The butler starts to pass by. Stew's 
eyes are blazing.

BINGY
Well, how does the old Cinderella 
man feel about that?

With a quick motion, Stew clips Bingy on the jaw. Bingy, 
caught unawares, reels backward.

CLOSER SHOT IN DOORWAY

Bingy describes a backward arc, just as Smythe, the butler, 
seeing he can be of service, steps forward and catches 
him.

SMYTHE
Well done, sir. Very neat.

STEW
(through his teeth)
That's what I think of it, Bingy!

Bingy sags in the butler's arms. The butler looks at Stew 
inquiringly. Stew nods.

STEW
(to butler)
Smythe, the - er - gentleman is 
leaving.

SMYTHE
Yes, sir.

Bingy is carried out. Stew stands glaring after them.

Good morning, Mother. Didn't I

Everybody thought he was so charming 
last night.

MRS. SCHUYLER
I was so worried for fear he'd 
knock over a vase or something. I 
must have acted like an idiot.
(notices the morning 
paper in Anne's 
hands)
What does it say about the reception 
last night?

ANNE
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, 
blah attended the blah, blah 
reception and wore the same blah, 
blah things.

MRS. SCHUYLER
(reproachfully)
Stop it. Anne. You're behaving 
like the person you're married to.

ANNE
You don't have anything to complain 
about, Mother. He was all right 
last night, wasn't he? I told you 
not to worry about him.

MRS. SCHUYLER
It was a miracle. The man was ill 
or something.

She suddenly notices front page of paper Anne is reading. 
Her face freezes in horror. She screams.

MRS. SCHUYLER
(screaming)
Ah-ah-ah!

Look! Look! The front page!

Mrs. Schuyler gets up. Paces wildly about room. In a frenzy.

MRS. SCHUYLER
I knew it! I knew it! I felt it in

She is interrupted by the entrance of Grayson, who dashes 
into the room, his eyes ablaze. In his hand he has a copy 
of the morning paper.

GRAYSON
(tapping paper in

Did you see the papers? "Cinderella

169. MEDIUM SHOT

Stew, now dressed in a business suit, comes from the 
direction of the stairs and stops just before he gets to 
the door of the drawing room. From within there is an 
ominous silence. Stew looks longingly in the direction of 
the front door - then back at the drawing room, squares 
his shoulders and goes in.

INT. SCHUYLER DRAWING ROOM

170. CLOSE SHOT

As Stew stops just inside the doorway. He had been prepared 
for this, but it strikes terror into his soul, just the 
same.

MEDIUM FULL SHOT

From his angle in the doorway. The jury - Dexter Grayson, 
hands behind his back - is standing, gazing at Stew with a 
fishy eye. Mrs. Schuyler stares haughtily. Anne is crying 
softly.

CONTINUATION SCENE 170

Stew - looking around at the gallery of faces. Then he 
forces a jaunty smile to his face as he starts to enter, 
whistling as he goes.

STEW
Good morning, everybody
(he gets a cold, 
frigid, silent 
reception)
Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, 
huh?
(to Anne)
Anne, did you ever get the feeling 
that there was someone else in the 
room with you?

Yes - the worm!

He's a worm - and I'm gonna step

173. CLOSER SHOT - STEW AND GRAYSON

STEW
You quit trying to stop anybody

GRAYSON
Well, at best you might deny it.

STEW
Why deny it? The more you deny, 
the more they print. Let them alone! 
The thing to do is to sit still 
and keep our traps shut.

GRAYSON
Traps shut!

STEW
Certainly! I'll take care of this 
guy Bingy myself, personally.
(sees Anne crying)
Now what are you crying about?

174. MEDIUM SHOT

ANNE
Is this true, Stewart? Did you 
really say it?

STEW
Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I 
didn't say it for publication, 
however.

MRS. SCHUYLER
And you struck him right here in 
our house?

STEW
Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right 
here in your house. And I'll strike 
anybody in anybody's house that 
calls me a Cinderella Man.

GRAYSON
Well, what else do you expect them 
to call you?

ANNE
Dexter.

CLOSEUP - STEW

STEW
(burning)
That's the fourteenth crack you've 
made to me. I'm keeping count. 
When you get to twenty, I'm gonna 
sock you right on the nose. As a 
matter of fact, I ought to sock 
you right now.

MEDIUM FULL SHOT

MRS. SCHUYLER
Anne Schuyler, are you going to 
sit there and watch this man insult 
us? Haven't you any decency left?

ANNE
(defending him)
Why doesn't Dexter show some 
decency? And you might show some 
too, Mother. What do you expect a 
man to do when he's called such 
names?
(to Stew)
I'm glad you hit that reporter, 
Stewart. He deserved it.

MRS. SCHUYLER
(rising)
All right, all right! It's your 
funeral, Anne Schuyler!

She flounces out. Grayson remains behind.

STEW
(to Grayson)
Go on, beat it, shadow.

Grayson turns to go, then braves the last word.

GRAYSON
Cinderella Man! That's fifteen.

He leaves in a huff. Stew puts his arms around the crying 
Anne.

FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

INT. SCHUYLER DRAWING ROOM

177. FULL SHOT

Six or eight people of distinction scattered around the 
room. All dressed in full evening clothes. Among them is 
Grayson, Anne, her mother, and one man in aviator's uniform. 
The men have their coats and hats in their hands, the women 
have their evening wraps on. Apparently they are ready to 
leave for someplace and are being detained. An indistinct 
murmur of ad-lib conversation is heard.

178. CLOSE SHOT

On Smythe, the butler, as he approaches Mrs. Schuyler.

SMYTHE
Pardon me, madam. They phoned 
through from the Mayor's committee 
to remind you it's past the hour 
for the reception.

MRS. SCHUYLER
Are the cars ready?

SMYTHE
They've been ready for the last 
half hour.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - GROUP

Including Captain White, a young, handsome aviator.

AVIATOR
(modestly)
I hope I don't have to make any 
speeches tonight, Anne.

ANNE
Oh, you can't disappoint all the 
women. After all it isn't every 
day they get to see a famous round-
the-world flier.

AVIATOR
Yes, I know, but they scare me to 
death. This is the fourth dinner 
you've taken me to this week. I'm 
running out of material.

ANNE
Are you complaining?

AVIATOR
Yes, there are always too many 
other people around.

LADY
Anne, it's getting late. What are 
we waiting for?

ANNE
We're waiting for my husband
(lightly, concealing 
her irritation)
If you'll excuse me, I'll run up 
and see what the slowpoke's doing.
(to aviator)
I'll be right back

She starts out, climbing stairs to Stew's room.

INT. STEW'S BEDROOM

180. MEDIUM SHOT

Stew stands in front of a mirror, fumbling with his dress 
tie. He pauses, his hands still on his tie.

ANNE
(reproachfully)
Stewart! We're all waiting for 
you. Where's your valet?

STEW
I poisoned him.

ANNE
Stop trying to be funny, and get 
ready, will you?

As he struggles with his collar, it springs off.

STEW
I'm not going!

ANNE
What are you talking about?

STEW
I'm talking about - I'm not going 
out.

CLOSEUP - ANNE

ANNE
(controlling her 
anger)
What am I going downstairs and 
tell those people?

STEW
Go downstairs, and tell them - 
anything. Tell them I'm not going. 
Tell them I'm not home.

ANNE
(getting angrier by 
the minute)
Stewart, would you mind telling me 
why you're not going?

CLOSEUP - STEW

STEW
Yes, I'll tell you - for the same 
reason I've never wanted to go out 
with those social parasites, those 
sweet-smelling fashion plates. I 
don't like them. They bore me. 
They give me the jitters.

ANNE'S VOICE
Do you know you're talking about 
my friends?

STEW
Yes, I'm talking about your friends, 
and they still give me the jitters.

183. DOUBLE SHOT

ANNE
Well, are you going - or aren't 
you?

Stew makes a move to embrace her.

STEW
Anne, come here. Listen

ANNE
(sternly - slipping 
away from him)
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.

STEW
I'll tell you what. Let's you and 
me sneak out all by ourselves

ANNE
(interrupting)
Are you crazy?

STEW
Think of the fun we can have - 
we'll sneak down the back stairs 
and get in the valet's Ford. How's 
that?

ANNE
Will you stop being silly, Stewart?

STEW
(trying hard)
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll 
take you and introduce you to all 
my gang. Would you like that?

ANNE
(hard)
But I don't want to meet your gang.

STEW
I don't mean the newspaper fellows 
that you don't like. Another gang 
I know - you'd love them. They're 
writers and musicians and artists - 
a great crowd of people - people 
who do great things. People who 
are worthwhile.

ANNE
Meaning, my friends aren't 
worthwhile, I suppose?

STEW
Oh, they're all right, Anne. But 
I

ANNE
(interrupting 
belligerently)
That's exactly what you mean. Heaven 
knows you've made that clear to me 
often enough. Well, I'm sick and 
tired of it. I've given you party 
after party - I've taken you to 
some of the best houses in this 
town - and introduced you to people 
of importance - and are you 
grateful? No! You insult them and 
act like a bore. I'm sick and tired 
of having to make excuses for you 
and the things that you've done. 
Perhaps it's just as well you're 
not coming tonight. Maybe I can 
enjoy myself for once without having 
to worry about you, and what you're 
going to do.

With which violent declaration, she flounces out of the 
room, leaving Stew staring after her, angry and hurt. 
Impulsively, he follows her to the door - a retort on his 
lips. When he gets there, however, she has vanished. He 
returns to the room, wanders about thoughtfully, extracts 
cigarette from box, fumbles it - walks to window - stares 
out - turns back to room - heaves a lonely sigh.

He notices his reflection in the mirror, and gestures toward 
it.

STEW
And that, my friends, is what is 
known as the society belle telling 
ex-star-newspaper-reporter to go 
to - how-have-you-been, Mr. Smith!

184. CLOSE SHOT

As Stew sits in a typewriter chair. He rolls up the sheet 
in the machine so that he can read what is already written.

INSERT: TYPEWRITTEN SHEET, IN TYPEWRITER

ACT 1
SCENE 1

AN HACIENDA IN MEXICO

Strumming of guitars are dimly heard.

BACK TO SCENE:

He studies it for a moment, frowning in dissatisfaction. 
He's stuck. He leans back in the chair and looks up for 
inspiration.

INSERT: A BIG CLOCK, TICKING AWAY THE TIME.

INT. SCHUYLER GRAND FOYER

185. LONG SHOT

Of Stew Smith pacing the grand foyer. Seen from overhead, 
he is dwarfed by the surroundings. He tries hopscotching 
on the pattern of the floor. That wears thin quickly. 
Supremely bored, Stew gives a shout and is rewarded with a 
cavernous echo. Smythe the butler then appears, nervously 
crouched behind some grillwork.

186. MEDIUM SHOT - STEW AND SMYTHE

SMYTHE
Did you call, sir?

STEW
Smythe, come here. I want to talk 
to you.
(Smythe looks 
unenthusiastic.)
Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, 
I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in 
this house! This big . . . come 
on, I'm not going to hurt you. 
Come on, what's the matter with 
you?

Stew gives another shout and is rewarded with another loud 
echo. This coaxes Smythe out from behind the grillwork.

STEW
Shhh! Do you hear something?

SMYTHE
Yes, sir.

STEW
You try it.

SMYTHE
(reluctant)
Me, sir?

STEW
Yeah.

Smythe gives it a timid try.

STEW
No, no. Give it more volume.

Smythe gives a more satisfactory yell. Stew nods approval. 
Smythe begins yelling and shouting in earnest.

STEW
No, that's enough. I just wanted 
you to get the idea. Now you know. 
This house is haunted.

SMYTHE
(incredulous)
No, sir!

STEW
Yes. Have you looked in the closets 
all over . . .?

SMYTHE
Yes, sir.

STEW
Found no skeletons?

SMYTHE
No, sir.

STEW
It's haunted just the same.

SMYTHE
Yes, sir.

Smythe has heard enough. He turns to leave, but Stew grabs 
him.

STEW
Smythe, what do you do with yourself - 
I mean, when you're not carrying 
those double-strength - what do 
you do with yourself?

SMYTHE
Well, sir, I putter.

STEW
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone 
and want to amuse yourself, then 
what?

SMYTHE
I just putter.

STEW
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have 
to have a putter to putter?

SMYTHE
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.

STEW
Well, isn't that nice? You just go 
right ahead and putter with your 
hands. That's all right. How do 
you do it?

SMYTHE
Well sir, I'll show you.

He demonstrates, touching objects on a table and blowing 
dust off a lampshade.

SMYTHE
That's puttering, sir.

STEW
No! Well, well, well! That's all 
right, if you like it. Can anybody 
do that?

SMYTHE
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural 
putterers. Others can never master 
it.

STEW
Oh my. You mean, some people are 
born and never will become 
putterers?

SMYTHE
Yes sir.

STEW
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To 
know that you could never be a 
putterer.

SMYTHE
Yes sir.

STEW
How about me?  Do you think if I 
concentrated and put my whole soul 
into it, that some day I might be 
a putterer?

SMYTHE
You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be 
a putterer. Not a good putterer, 
sir.

STEW
Well, if I couldn't be a good 
putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. 
But why? What makes you think I 
couldn't be a good putterer?

SMYTHE
Well sir, to be a putterer, one's 
mind must be at ease. A person 
with a problem could never be a 
putterer. For instance, sir, a 
fish can putter in water but not 
on land because he'd be out of 
place. An eagle can putter around 
a rugged mountaintop but not in a 
cage, because he'd be restless and 
unhappy. Now sir, if you will pardon 
me, with all due respect, sir, as 
a Smythe to a Smith, you are an 
eagle in a cage.

STEW
A bird in a gilded cage?

SMYTHE
Yes.

STEW
That's all I wanted to know!

Stew rushes off upstairs. Smythe gives the echo one last 
try.

FADE OUT:

INT. STEW'S ROOM

187. MEDIUM SHOT

As Stew makes a telephone call.

STEW
Hello, Gallagher old pal. How are 
you, old pal?

INT. GALLAGHER'S ROOM - NIGHT

188. MEDIUM SHOT

A simple room, probably in a boarding house or cheap hotel. 
Gallagher is on the phone. A typewriter stands nearby.

GALLAGHER
Oh, hello Stew. I'm pretty good, 
can't complain. How's our gentleman 
of leisure?

CONTINUATION SCENE 187

Stew at phone.

STEW
I'm on the coast of Norway and I 
can't get out - will you come and 
get me out of the coast of Norway?

CONTINUATION SCENE 188

Gallagher at phone.

GALLAGHER
Oh, your play. Hmmm, Act One, Scene 
One: Coast of Norway - and then a 
lot of blank. Is that it?

CONTINUATION SCENE 187

Stew at phone.

STEW
Yeah. Come on, don't be silly.
(pause)
All right, if you feel like you 
need a chaper-one, call up Hank. 
Yeah. You'll find him at Joe's, no 
doubt. Yeah. Hank would be my idea 
of a perfect bodyguard.
(pause)
Sure you would. I knew I could 
depend on you, old pal. Snap it 
up, will you, Gallagher?

CONTINUATION SCENE 188

Gallagher at phone.

GALLAGHER
Okay.

She hangs up, joyful at the prospect of seeing Stew. She 
hums softly to herself as she picks up the receiver again.

INT. SCHUYLER ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT

189. MED. SHOT

SOUND - BELL RINGING

Stew comes out of the library. Smythe is going down the 
hall. Stew intercepts him.

STEW
Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting 
some friends.

SMYTHE
Very good, sir.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

At entrance door. Stew enters and opens it. Gallagher and 
Hank enter.

STEW
Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.

GALLAGHER
Hello, Stew.

STEW
Hello, Hank. How are you?

HANK
Fine, but kinda thirsty.

STEW
Come right in - I'll get you a 
drink.

HANK
Okay - you remember Joe

STEW
Sure.

HANK
I sort of invited him along to 
bend an elbow. You don't mind, do 
you?

STEW
It's all right. Bring him in.

Joe appears in the open doorway. Stew sees him.

HANK
Come in, Joe. It's all right.

STEW
Hello, Joe.

JOE
Hello kid, how are you? Glad to 
see you.

Stew starts to close the door.

JOE
Just a minute - Johnson's outside. 
You don't mind if he comes in and 
dips a beak do you?

STEW
No, no, bring him in. The more the 
merrier.

JOE
Come on in!

Johnson appears in the open doorway. Stew sees him.

STEW
Hello, Johnson.

JOHNSON
Hello, Stew, old pal. How are you?

STEW
Glad to see you. Come in, kid.

Stew starts to close the door.

JOHNSON
Wait a minute. I got two of the 
boys I brought along - they were 
cruising around with nothing to 
do. You don't mind if I bring them 
in?

STEW
You brought two of the boys? That's 
all right. Bring them in. What's 
the difference?

The two enter, followed in a single file by 12-14 men and 
women, all of whom greet Stew as they enter, ad-libbing 
hello's and hand-shakes. Stew stares at them dumbfoundedly.

MEDIUM FULL SHOT

They swarm into the hallway and overflow into the rooms on 
either side. The butler stands aghast at this invasion.  
Stew starts to close the door when three or four more troop 
in, shouting cheery greetings. Stew regards them in 
amazement.

CLOSER SHOT - STEW

As he watches them file past.

STEW
I'm sorry nobody could come.

HANK
The rest of the gang had to get 
out the morning edition - but 
they'll be down later.

STEW
Now Hank, are you sure they're 
coming?  It will be lonesome without 
them.
(to Smythe)
Smythe, take this crowd in there 
and give them a drink. And find 
out what the boys in the back room 
want!

Smythe gulps nervously, as he is dragged off by the 
revellers.

INT. SCHUYLER DRAWING ROOM

193. FULL SHOT

The gang have taken seriously Stew's suggestion that they 
make themselves at home. They have draped themselves about 
the place - a couple are strumming on the piano and others 
are inspecting the room in awe-struck attitudes. Smythe is 
being propelled around the room by the revellers.

SMYTHE
It isn't done, gentlemen! It isn't 
done, I say! It isn't done!

INT. SCHUYLER ENTRANCE HALL

194. MEDIUM SHOT - GALLAGHER AND STEW

STEW
Well, Gallagher, you certainly 
took no chances, did you?

GALLAGHER
I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and 
Hank did the rest.

STEW
I see. Hank brought them all. That's 
all right. We'll give them a drink 
and throw 'em out. How's that?

GALLAGHER
Okay.

STEW
(as Smythe passes 
by, being propelled 
by revellers)
Smythe! Give them one drink and 
throw 'em out!

SMYTHE
(dazed)
Yes, sir.

Bingy pokes his head in the door, wearing a false beard.

STEW
(spotting him)
Is there a green elephant standing 
beside that bwana?

BINGY
No, it's just little Bingy Baker.

Stew rolls up his sleeves, preparatory to launching a punch.

BINGY
(warningly)
Uh-uh.

Bingy dons a pair of glasses, and points to them 
meaningfully. He enters, cautiously, watching Stew warily.

BINGY
(striking a pose)
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's 
tepee to make friends. Big Chief 
very sorry. To show how sorry - 
will bend over and let white man 
kick Big Chief where sun never 
shines.

STEW
Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't 
miss this one for the world.

He bends over, and Stew winds up and delivers a hard kick 
to his backside. Bingy straightens stiffly, then removes a 
bottle of alcohol from the target area.

BINGY
Fire water all right.
(he takes a drink)

Both start laughing.

BINGY
Well, Stew, that's all thrashed 
out. By golly, I'm surely glad to 
see that you're not really sore. 
You know our racket - after all, 
news is news.

STEW
Sure, sure. That's all right. That 
was a great story, Bingy. A great 
story - wish I'd printed it.

BINGY
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? 
That hairy chest story!

STEW
(indicating Bingy's 
false beard)
You've raised it up to the chin, I 
see.
(laughs)
Go on in the other room and get 
yourself a drink.

Bingy emits a war-whoop and proceeds into the drawing room, 
where Smythe is still being held hostage by the party.

195. CLOSER SHOT

Gallagher and Stew.

STEW
You know what I should do with 
you? I should sock you right in 
that funny little nose.

GALLAGHER
Yes - and I'd love it.

SMYTHE
Sure, you'd love it.

He draws her out of the entrance hall, and the CAMERA MOVES 
WITH THEM as they head upstairs, the party around them 
going in full force.

INT. STEW'S SITTING ROOM

196. MEDIUM SHOT

Stew and Gallagher enter. Apparently they have been talking 
about Stew's play on the way upstairs.

GALLAGHER
How far have you gotten?

STEW
Well, I've just been able to get 
off that Norway coast - so far.

Stew gestures toward the typewriter from which a sheet of 
paper is protruding. Gallagher crosses to it. She rolls up 
the sheet so she can read what is typed on it.

GALLAGHER
(reading)
'Act One - Scene One - A Street in 
Old Madrid'

She turns as Stew walks over to her.

GALLAGHER
(smiling)
Well, you're not getting your play 
done, but you're certainly covering 
a lot of territory.

STEW
(grins)
Haven't I covered some territory? 
It feels like I've been on a Cook's 
Tour[18] some place.

CLOSER TWO SHOT

Stew, standing before her.

GALLAGHER
(seriously)
Stewart, have you ever been to Old 
Madrid?

STEW
(grinning in spite 
of himself)
Been where?

GALLAGHER
To Old Madrid.

STEW
Never even been to New Madrid.

GALLAGHER
Then how do you expect to write 
about it?

STEW
Oh - draw on my imagination, I 
suppose.

GALLAGHER
Did Conrad draw on his imagination?

Stew is brought up with a start.

STEW
Did who?

GALLAGHER
Conrad.

STEW
What do you know about Conrad?

GALLAGHER
I don't know a thing about him, 
but isn't he the one you're always 
yelling about?

Stew is noticeably impressed with this point of view.

STEW
Gosh, you look cute.

Gallagher warms up to her subject.

GALLAGHER
Isn't he the one that always writes 
about things - only the things he 
knows about?

STEW
Right.

GALLAGHER
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote 
about it?

STEW
Right.

198. MEDIUM SHOT

GALLAGHER
Then why don't you write about 
something you know?  Write about 
yourself and Anne. The poor boy 
who marries a rich girl - now 
there's a swell theme.

STEW
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. 
That's an idea there. I wonder 
now...

GALLAGHER
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful 
heroine...

STEW
(warming up - he 
puts arm around 
Gallagher's shoulder)
And there's her mother - and what 
a character that old dame would 
make with her double-strength - 
and that lawyer friend of theirs -
he'd make a great villain - and 
there's you!

GALLAGHER
(smiling)
What could I be?

STEW
You could be something.
(inspiration 
striking, he dashes 
to the typewriter)
I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's 
get this set. That's a great idea 
for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, 
will you?

GALLAGHER
Here you are.

STEW
All right, thanks. Now, let's see. 
How will I start? Hey pal, how 
would you start?

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SCHUYLER ENTRANCE HALL

MED. FULL SHOT

Shooting through into the drawing room. It is many hours 
later. The members of the party, including Smythe, are 
pretty well lit. On the floor of the entrance hall a dice 
game is in progress. In the drawing room four or five are 
hanging over the piano singing "The Grasshopper Jumped 
Over Another Grasshopper's Back."

In general, a large time is being had. As the scene opens 
a door-bell is ringing. A key is heard in the lock.

200. CLOSER SHOT - GROUP - IN ENTRANCE HALL

The outer door starts to swing open. One of the party 
guests, very wall-eyed now, and carrying a whiskey bottle 
in his hand, staggers toward the door. It opens wider, and 
Anne and Mrs. Schuyler and Dexter Grayson stand gasping in 
the opening. The guest comes up to them.

GUEST
(starting to close 
door)
Say, you can't come in here - this 
is a private party.

Anne pushes the door violently, which sends the guest 
sprawling. He stays where he lands, holding the bottle in 
both arms across his chest. Anne and her mother advance 
into a CLOSE SHOT and look off with incredulous horror and 
amazement.

201. MEDIUM SHOT

On a drunk Bingy as he peers at them from an alcove above.

BINGY
(recognizing Grayson)
Hey, my old classmate from Harvard!  
Whoopee! Harvard, '98!
(spotting Mrs. 
Schuyler)
Hello, mama!

202. MEDIUM SHOT

Most are too cock-eyed or too engrossed in the ongoing 
crap game to notice them.

DEXTER
I know who's the cause of it all!

ANNE
Oh, Dexter!

One of the men wanders in from the drawing room in time to 
hear this conversation. He assumes an attitude of 
exaggerated courtesy and gallantry as he bows before them.

Anne and her mother are almost bursting with fury. They 
spot Smythe, across the room, thoroughly in his cups.

MRS. SCHUYLER
(to butler)
Smythe! Smythe - who are these 
people?

Smythe comes stumbling up, a grin plastered on his face.

SMYTHE
(thoroughly plastered)
Friends of mine. Very lit-lit-
literary people.

GRAYSON
(confidentially, to 
Mrs. Schuyler)
He's drunk.

MRS. SCHUYLER
(aghast)
Smythe, you've been drinking.

SMYTHE
(proudly)
I have. Double-strength!

GRAYSON
(confidentially)
Very drunk.

MRS. SCHUYLER
(indignant)
Where is Mr. Smith?

SMYTHE
Well, for crying out loud, I don't 
know. And I don't care. Whoopee!

He jubilantly exits scene.

GRAYSON
(confidentially)
Very, very drunk.

INT. STEW'S SITTING ROOM

203. MEDIUM SHOT

Stew gets to his feet as an idea strikes him.

STEW
Now Gallagher, if we could only 
get a great scene - a tremendously 
emotional scene - something that 
would just wring the hearts out of 
the public - to bring the curtain 
down in the second act - that would 
be okay. Couldn't dig one out of 
your hat some place, could you?

GALLAGHER
Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks 
tonight.

STEW
Now, we've got it right up to where 
the boy's wearing his white spats 
and going to teas and the frau 
enters - how's that?

GALLAGHER
Very good.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

At the partially opened door into the hall. It opens wider, 
and Anne looks in. She stares in horrified amazement.

205. MEDIUM SHOT (FROM HER ANGLE)

Gallagher, her shoes off, sprawled out on the chaise longue, 
stretches luxuriously and yawns. CAMERA PANS TO Stew at 
the typewriter, hair mussed, coffee pot and cups prominent, 
the dressing gown over the back of his chair. Neither of 
them has seen Anne.

CONTINUATION SCENE 204

Anne. She gasps as she quietly steps further into the room.

CLOSE SHOT - GALLAGHER

Gallagher, caught in the midst of a grand stretch, sits up 
abruptly, startled. She stares uncomfortably off at Anne.

CLOSE SHOT - STEW

At the typewriter. He glances up momentarily and very 
absently, and goes right on typing.

STEW
(absently)
Oh hello, Anne He types furiously.

ANNE
(tight-lipped)
Good morning. What does this mean?

Stewart looks up surprised at the tone of her voice.

STEW
What does what mean?

MEDIUM SHOT - THE THREE

Gallagher, sensing scene, starts hastily looking for her 
shoes. One of them has been shoved under the chaise longue 
and she has to get down on her hands and knees to retrieve 
it. Anne comes in and confronts them, her hands on her 
hips.

STEW
Oh, that mob downstairs. I guess I 
got so interested in the play I 
forgot all about them.

ANNE
I see.

STEW
Have we got a play, Anne? Oh, have 
we got a play!  Of course most of 
it is Gallagher's. She did most of 
it. That brain of hers just snaps 
like that all the time.

He indicates by snapping his fingers. Gallagher quietly 
gathers up her things, apprehensive of the storm about to 
break.

ANNE
(coldly)
I'm not interested in the way her 
brain snaps.

Stew stares at Anne as Gallagher, her hat in her hand, her 
coat over her arm, starts for the door.

GALLAGHER
I think I better go, Stew.

ANNE
I think you should, Miss Gallagher.

STEW
Wait a minute, Gallagher.

Gallagher stops, transfixed by the new tone in his voice. 
He comes over to Anne.

209. CLOSE TWO SHOT - ANNE AND STEW

STEW
What's the idea, Anne?

ANNE
The idea is simply this - that I 
want those people to leave here 
immediately.

STEW
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being 
a little unreasonable?

ANNE
Unreasonable!  Have you any idea 
what the place looks like 
downstairs? Do you expect me to 
stand here and see this place turned 
into a cheap barroom?

STEW
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. 
There's no reason for that. Perhaps 
the boys have had a little too 
much to drink. That's all right. 
I'm sorry. I'll go right down and 
throw them out. That's no reason 
for you to take this attitude. 
After all, I certainly have a right 
to invite a few of my friends to 
my house, haven't I?

ANNE
(pointedly)
Your house?

STEW
(getting the 
implication; after 
a pause)
O-o-oh, I get you
(a knowing chuckle)
All right. All right. I don't blame 
you. I kinda forgot myself for a 
moment, there. That's what I call 
getting me told, isn't it, Anne?

Anne remains silent. That's exactly what she has done.

STEW
I suppose I've been boarding out 
this past year.

210. MEDIUM SHOT

He takes his coat off back of chair and slips into it.

STEW
(quietly; grimly)
All right, I'll tell you thisI 
don't like your boarding house, 
lady

As he gathers up loose manuscript, he continues . . .

STEW
and if it's all the same to you, 
I'm moving out.

ANNE
Stewart!

STEW
(hotly)
This is something I should have 
done a long time ago, only I didn't 
have sense enough to do it. No, I 
had to stick around here to try 
and make a success of something 
that I knew darn well was a failure 
from the very beginning. But no 
more. No more! So that's that.

ANNE
You can't walk out of here like 
this.

Throughout the scene, Stew is gathering his things 
togetherand probably packing an overnight bag.

STEW
Oh I can't? Who's going to stop 
me?  I'd like to see somebody stop 
me. If you think I'm going to stick 
around this joint just to look at 
this mausoleum, not on your life!  
You're going to make no stuffed 
shirt out of me. Now what do you 
think of that?

Mrs. Schuyler stalks majestically in.

MRS. SCHUYLER
What's going on here? Who is this 
woman?

STEW
(snappily)
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?

MRS. SCHUYLER
Heavens! The man's insane!

CLOSEUP - STEW

STEW
Sure I'm insane, but I've got some 
good news for you.
(points to himself)
This magnolia is leaving your sweet 
smelling vanilla joint. This bird 
in a cage is gonna button his own 
pants from now on. And that is 
what is known as telling the mother-
in-law.

Gallagher's cry of joy is cut off by an icy look from Mrs. 
Schuyler.

GALLAGHER
Eurek!

212. MEDIUM SHOT

Stew is stuffing things into a bag.

STEW
(heatedly to Anne)
You've done nothing but watch me - 
watch me! - ever since I've been 
here. Treated me like a thug, 
watched me like a hawk, mistrusted 
me. Every time I leave the house, 
that Jane
(indicating Mrs. 
Schuyler)
goes out and counts the silverware.

ANNE
That's ridiculous.

STEW
Fine!  I don't blame her. I know 
I'm out of my own crowd. I should 
have had better sense in the 
beginning. But I'll stay in my own 
backyard from now on.

ANNE
You're acting like a child.

STEW
All right, I'm a child. Have it 
any way you want. But I'm going 
back to my own apartment, where I 
should have lived in the first 
place. But no, I got to listen to 
you and move here. All right. If 
you want to live with me, Anne, 
okay. But the sign outside will 
say "Mr. Stew Smith" and you'll 
have to be "Mrs. Stew Smith" or 
there's nothing doing. No more 
Anne Schuyler's husbandHe has his 
bag all packed by this time. He 
snaps it shut viciously, lifts it 
off the chair, picks up his hat, 
and notices Mrs. Schuyler staring 
open-mouthed at him.
(to Mrs. Schuyler, 
pointedly)
and here's some more news for 
you. You can take your red room, 
your green room, your left wing 
and your right wing, and you know 
what you can do with them!
(to Gallagher)
Come on, Gallagher.

He brushes by Mrs. Schuyler and Anne, exiting.

ANNE
(exasperated)
Oh, Stewart!

EXT. SCHUYLER HOME - NIGHT

213. MEDIUM SHOT

Stew and Gallagher appear, coming through the iron gates.

MEDIUM MOVING SHOT

As Stew and Gallagher move off down the street, a ragged 
old panhandler comes wheedling up to them.

PANHANDLER
Pardon me, could you spare a dime 
for a cup of coffee?

Stew is struck by a sudden idea as he regards the bum 
intently.

STEW
Coffee? How would you like to be a 
Knight of the Garter?

PANHANDLER
(stupidly)
Huh! No

Stew raises one foot, then the other, and quickly removes 
the solid gold garters which he presses into the bum's 
surprised hand.

STEW
(as he removes the 
garters)
Just a minute.
(to Gallagher)
Entertain the gentleman, Gallagher.
(to the panhandler)
There you are, my man - with those 
you can eat for a couple of months.

He walks away, leaving the bum staring dazedly at the 
luxurious pair of garters.

PANHANDLER
(an afterthought)
How about the socks?

MED. CLOSE SHOT

As Stew and Gallagher pass the Camera and go down the 
street, arm in arm. As they get past the Camera, Stew is 
seen to square his shoulders and throw out his chest. He 
shakes first one leg, and then the other, as if he were 
throwing off shackles.

CLOSER MOVING SHOT

Stew and Gallagher moving along. Gallagher has a peculiar 
expression as she glances at Stew. She has been deeply 
affected by the scene she has just witnessed. Stew's face 
is very thoughtful.

GALLAGHER
(comfortingly)
I wouldn't worry too much about 
it, Stew. She'll see it your way.

STEW
Huh?
(snapping out of it)
Oh, I'm not worrying about her - 
I'm worrying about that second act 
curtain, that's all.

Gallagher stares at him, realizing he is thinking more 
about the play than his split-up with his wife. Then she 
breaks into a grin.

GALLAGHER
Why, you're just a first-class 
chump!  You just staged a scene 
that would play like a million 
dollars!  How about that declaration 
of independence for the second act 
curtain?

Stew stops stock still and stares at her.

STEW
(almost reverently)
That's an idea, Gallagher - a great 
idea.

Gallagher happily links her arm in his and again they move 
down the street.

Act 3. Scene 1.

LAP DISSOLVE TO:

INT. STEW'S APARTMENT - DAY - MED. FULL SHOT

Inexpensive but comfortable. Stew is in his shirtsleeves. 
A battered old typewriter stands on the table with a sheet 
of blank paper in it. Stew is seated in a chair before it, 
and is picking out the letters, typing. He pauses, running 
up the roller to regard what he has written.

INT. STEW'S KITCHENETTE - MED. SHOT

Gallagher, in a little apron, is frying some ham and eggs. 
She looks up as she sees Stew from the doorway.

STEW
Hey, Gallagher!

GALLAGHER
Yeah?

STEW
How about my breakfast? How do you 
expect me to ring a curtain down 
on an empty stomach?

GALLAGHER
It'll be ready in a minute.

STEW
(accusingly)
Never mind that. If you can't get 
my breakfast ready - and can't get 
here on time in the morning - then 
you can go get yourself another 
job.

GALLAGHER
(in mock contrition)
Sorry, boss

STEW
Don't be sorry. Just get the 
breakfast, that's all.

INT. STEW'S LIVING ROOM - MED. SHOT

There is a knock on the hall door.

Stew crosses and opens it.

220. CLOSER SHOT

As Stew opens the door. It reveals Dexter Grayson in the 
little hallway, immaculately clad, as usual. Stew regards 
him in frank surprise for a moment.

GRAYSON
Hello, Smith.

STEW
(puzzled)
Holy jumping swordfish!

GRAYSON
I suppose you know why I came?

STEW
No, I have no idea - unless some 
of the silver-ware is missing.

GRAYSON
Now don't be absurd, Smith
(as he brushes past, 
walking inside)
May I come in?

STEW
Surely, come right in.

GRAYSON
(as he sits down)
Thanks. May I sit down?

STEW
Surely, sit down. If I had known 
you were coming, I would have thrown 
you up a waffle.

GRAYSON
I don't eat waffles.

STEW
You don't.

221. MED. SHOT

Grayson sits stiffly on one of the Grand Rapids chairs. 
Stew remains standing, and waits silently for Grayson to 
speak. Grayson clears his throat.

GRAYSON
Anne asked me to come and see you 
about the divorce.

STEW
(with enlightened 
expression)
She did?

GRAYSON
(uncomfortably)
She wants me to arrange the 
financial settlement.

STEW
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks 
and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne 
can have any part of that she wants, 
but she'd better hurry because I'm 
spending it awfully fast.

GRAYSON
(interrupting)
You don't seem to understand. Anne 
doesn't expect anything from you.

INT. STEW'S KITCHENETTE - MED. SHOT

Gallagher. Overcome by curiosity at the sound of voices, 
she leaves the frying eggs and goes quietly to the doorway 
and peeks out.

223. MED. SHOT

Grayson and Stew.

GRAYSON
We should like to know how much 
you would want to

Stew stares off incredulously.

STEW
(interrupting)
Wait a minute. Do I get from you 
that she wants to pay me alimony?

GRAYSON
That's putting it crudely, but

Stew starts advancing nervously toward him. Grayson, a bit 
alarmed, rises.

STEW
(closing in on him)
Remember what I told you about 
that twentieth crack? All right, 
you've just made it. Before you go 
unconscious I want you to get this 
through your nut.

GRAYSON
I beg your pardon.

STEW
Unconscious. You know, when you 
don't know anything. Your natural 
state. There are some people - you 
can't buy their self-respect for a 
bucket of shekels - well, I happen 
to be one of those guys.

224. CLOSE SHOT

Showing kitchen door open a crack. Gallagher's eyes are 
glistening as she watches and listens.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

Stew and Grayson.

GRAYSON
(weakly)
We just thought that

STEW
(snaps)
Don't think. Let me do all the 
thinking. Now you go back to that 
Schuyler outfit and tell them that 
I didn't marry that dame for her 
dough and I don't want any of her 
dough now. I was too poor to buy 
her a wedding present when we got 
married, so I'm giving her a divorce 
for a wedding present. Now, stand 
up!

Grayson does so, completely intimidated by Stew's manner. 
Stew grabs him by the lapel.

GRAYSON
Yes.

STEW
And now for that twentieth crack

Stew punches Grayson on chin and knocks him through the 
open door into the hall.

He slams door shut.

226. WIDER SHOT

Stew thrusts his hands into his pockets and walks 
thoughtfully back to the typewriter.

227. CLOSER SHOT

Stew standing staring down at the typewriter. He is still 
flushed with anger. Suddenly a thought strikes him, and 
his face breaks into a broad grin. He sits down quickly, 
and begins pounding away.

228. MED. SHOT

Gallagher enters from the kitchen, carrying a platter of 
ham and eggs and a coffee pot. She sets them on a small 
table and this is spread with a cloth. Then she crosses 
over to Stew.

GALLAGHER
(pretending ignorance)
Who was that?

STEW
(without looking up 
from his typing)
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.

GALLAGHER
What did he want?

STEW
Gallagher, that guy just dropped 
by to give us a great opening for 
the third act.

They sit at the little table.

229. CLOSER SHOT

GALLAGHER
What was the idea he gave you?

Stew dives into the ham and eggs.

STEW
It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's 
this?  The wife's family lawyer 
comes to see the kid, see - to 
talk over the divorce. Then this 
guy insults the poor but honest 
boy by offering him alimony - so 
the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer 
in the nose and throws him out. 
How's that for the beginning of 
the third act, huh?

GALLAGHER
Well, from now on the play will be 
easy. All you have to do is bring 
the wife back, have her say she's 
sorry, and then your play's over.

CLOSEUP - STEW

He looks over at Gallagher with a peculiar expression.

STEW
(vehemently - as he 
scoops out some 
melon)
What's the matter? Do you think 
I'm going to let that guy go back 
to his wife? Not on your life. 
He's got to go to the other girl.

CLOSEUP - GALLAGHER

She almost drops her coffee cup in a wild gleam of hope as 
she looks back at him. Gallagher tries hard to keep her 
voice steady.

GALLAGHER
(not sure of herself)
What other girl?

232. MED. CLOSE SHOT OF THE TWO

STEW
The little O'Brien girl, of course - 
the one you suggested in the story.

GALLAGHER
(ecstatic, but still 
fighting)
But that's ridiculous! You can't 
make a sudden change like that.

STEW
Gallagher, what are you going to 
do - tell me how to write a play?

GALLAGHER
No.

STEW
There's nothing sudden about that
(tensely)
He's always loved the girl, but he 
was such a sap he didn't have sense 
enough to tell her. Well, that's 
all right - we can fix that. He 
will go to the little O'Brien girl, 
and - here, I'll show you.

He gets to his feet, and comes around to her.

CLOSE TWO SHOT

Gallagher watches him a bit uncertainly.

STEW
(tenderly)
He goes to the little O'Brien gal 
and he says to her - in some pretty 
words of some kind - something 
that you can write - he'll say
(as if reading part - 
very emotional)
Darling, I'm sorry. I've been a 
fool all my life. I've always loved 
you, only I didn't have sense enough 
to see it. As quick as I can get a 
divorce from my wife, I want you 
to marry me. Then she'll look at 
him that way - yeah - then they'll 
embrace, or something like that.
(they draw closer)
Then he'll kiss her, or something.

To demonstrate the point, Stew takes her in his arms and 
kisses her. They hold the kiss longer than is justified. 
Stew is swept away by his sudden emotion and clings to her 
desperately, while Gallagher's arms instinctively go around 
his neck.

Gallagher chokes back tears that persist in coming. She 
stifles a sob. Stew folds her in his arms.

STEW
(tenderly)
What's the matter, Gallagher? What's 
the matter?

Gallagher buries her face in his shoulders.

FADE IN:

EXT. OPEN LANDSCAPE WITH RAILROAD TRACKS -- DAY

LONG SHOT

A STREAMLINER coming TOWARDS CAMERA which is off to one 
side of tracks. The landscape has pine and fir trees and 
is a northern Washington landscape.

As the streamliner passes, the CAMERA PANS around following 
it and stops. The streamliner tears off into the distance 
and in the foreground is WE SEE a RAILROAD SIGN --

"EVERETT WASH"

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. STREAMLINER IN MOTION - CORRIDOR -- DAY

SHOWING OPEN DOORS OF FOUR ROOMETTES

Through the windows can be seen the landscape through which 
the train is passing. In the first roomette, counting from 
the left, is a well-dressed, rather wise-looking FEMALE, 
young, smart. She is making up her face.

In the second is a middle-aged couple, a CANADIAN 
IMMIGRATION INSPECTOR and a CANADIAN CUSTOMS INSPECTOR.

In the third, BETTY MAYFIELD is seated near the window, 
turning over the pages of a magazine. She is about 27 years 
old, beautiful, blonde, and has a remote troubled 
expression, as though her thoughts were far away.

The fourth is empty. There is a man's suitcase in evidence 
on the seat. LARRY MITCHELL enters from the left. He is 
tall, good-looking, young, with superficial charm and rather 
too much self-assurance.

He glances in at the woman in the first roomette, stops in 
the door and leans against it.

We MOVE IN so this scene becomes a SHOT of a single 
roomette. OVER SCENE is HEARD the voices of the Canadian 
Immigration Officer.

CANADIAN OFFICIAL (O.S.)
Good afternoon. You name, please.

PASSENGER (O.S.)
George Olson.

MITCHELL
(to the unknown 
woman)
Better stop while it's still 
perfect.

She looks up at him with a slow stare.

CANADIAN OFFICIAL (O.S.)
And where were you born, Mr. Olson?

PASSENGER (O.S.)
Waukegan, Illinois.

UNKNOWN WOMAN
(to Mitchell)
Is there something I can do for 
you?

MITCHELL
There are a lot of things you could 
do for me.

IMMIGRATION INSPECTOR (O.S.)
And this is your wife, Mr. Olson?

PASSENGER (O.S.)
Yes. She was born in Waukegan, 
too. Same as Jack Benny, you know.

OFFICER (O.S.)
(puzzled)
Jack Benny?

UNKNOWN WOMAN
(to Mitchell)
Well, there is something you could 
do for me.

MITCHELL
I'd be delighted.

UNKNOWN WOMAN
You can move to one side. So my 
husband can get in.

Mitchell glances back, then moves to one side with a smile.  
He is quite unperturbed. A rather decrepit MAN creeps past 
him into the roomette with the unknown WOMAN. She gives 
Mitchell a quick flashing smile. Mitchell grins, turns 
away.

CAMERA PULLS BACK AND PANS HIM PAST THE NEXT ROOMETTE

We now see the IMMIGRATION and CUSTOMS OFFICIALS and two 
MIDDLE-AGED PASSENGERS.

CUSTOMS OFFICIAL
(to Olson)
Any firearms? Dutiable articles of 
any kind, Mr. Olson?

Olson shakes his head.

CAMERA PANS Mitchell past this door to the door of better 
Mayfield's roomette. He leans in this as he did in the 
unknown Woman's roomette.

MITCHELL
(to Betty)
Would you care to see the Seattle 
paper?

Betty turns slowly, stares at him.

BETTY
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.

MITCHELL
My name's Larry Mitchell. I live 
in Vancouver.

Betty says nothing.

MITCHELL
Same as an hour ago. Remember?  
I'm the steady type.

BETTY
(coldly)
I'm afraid there's nothing I can 
do about it, Mr. Mitchell.

CAMERA NOW HAS MOVED IN CLOSE enough to exclude the other 
roomettes completely.

MITCHELL
You could tell me your name. And 
where you're going.

BETTY
How far does this train go?

MITCHELL
Vancouver, B.C.

BETTY
I'm going to Vancouver, Mr.  
Mitchell.

She picks up a magazine and opens it, ignoring him.

MITCHELL
O.K. Be rugged.

He turns, starts out, then looks back at her.

MITCHELL
You're next for the Immigration 
and Customs. I trust your papers 
are all in order.

Betty looks up quickly and cannot conceal a startled 
expression. Mitchell reacts.

CAMERA PULLS BACK as he comes out into corridor, looks 
towards the roomette in which the officials are, then turns 
towards the next roomette and goes into it. Fusses with 
his suitcase.

CAMERA PANS across to the officials coming out of Olson's 
roomette. As they come out of Olson's roomette.

CANADIAN IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL
I hope you will enjoy your stay in 
Canada, Mr. Olson.

OLSON'S VOICE (O.S.)
Thanks.

Canadian officials then go on to Betty's roomette, enter.

CANADIAN IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL
Your name, please.

BETTY
Betty.. Mayfield.

There is a perceptible hesitation which immigration 
officials notices.

OFFICIAL
Betty Mayfield. Miss or Mrs.

Mitchell is seen in his roomette, standing near the door 
listening.

BETTY
Miss Mayfield.

OFFICIAL
And where were you born, Miss 
Mayfield?

BETTY
New York, City.

The official is a little suspicious. He looks down at 
Betty's hands which are clasped in her lap.

OFFICIAL
I see you are wearing a wedding 
ring.

BETTY
I've been married. My Husband..
(she breaks off and 
bites her lip)

INSPECTOR
Then I take it Mayfield was not 
your married name?

He is very polite, but is building up to asking for some 
identification papers. One this cue, Mitchell comes out of 
his roomette, crosses, enters Betty's roomette.

CAMERA MOVES IN

MITCHELL
I've wired ahead to--

He breaks off, turns to Inspector, recognizes him.

MITCHELL
Inspector Gillette, Isn't it? I'm 
Larry Mitchell. We've met before, 
several times.

He takes out wallet and holds it out to Inspector.

MITCHELL
I cross the border so often I carry 
an identification card.

INSPECTOR
(glancing at card)
Yes, I remember you, Mr.  Mitchell.
(glancing at Betty)
You know this lady?

MITCHELL
Very well. Since 1940, at least.  
I met her--let me see--it was New 
York City, wasn't it Betty?

Betty nods silently. Inspector turns back to her, handing 
Mitchell's wallet back.

INSPECTOR
(to Betty)
How long do you expect to be in 
Canada, Miss Mayfield?

BETTY
Oh.. a month.

INSPECTOR
(making up his mind)
Thank you. I hope you have a 
pleasant trip.

He turns away, starts out.

CUSTOMS INSPECTOR
(to Betty)
Any firearms? Dutiable articles of 
any kind?

BETTY
No.

CUSTOMS OFFICIAL
Thank you.

He marks her baggage.

MITCHELL
(to Customs Inspector)
My suitcases are open in the next 
room.

CUSTOMS INSPECTOR
(to Mitchell)
Anything dutiable, Mr. Mitchell?

MITCHELL
No. Nothing.

CUSTOMS INSPECTOR
Thank you.

Custom Inspector goes out. Mitchell sits down, looks at 
Betty coolly. She avoids his eyes.

MITCHELL
Better get rid of the wedding ring. 
That's what threw him.

Betty looks out of the window, says nothing.

MITCHELL
Trouble?

Betty turns her head and looks at him without speaking. 
Her face is empty of expression.

MITCHELL
Or Reno?
(a beat)
They always throw them off the 
bridge there, I've heard.

BETTY
Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.

MITCHELL
Where are you staying in Vancouver 
Royal. It's pretty crowded you 
know.

BETTY
Is it? I expected to go to the 
Vancouver Royal. Should I have a 
reservation?

MITCHELL
I'll make one for you.
(a beat)
I live there.

BETTY
(doubtfully)
Well..

MITCHELL
(quietly)
A very small service. It doesn't 
even ask for thanks. How long for?

BETTY
I really don't know.

MITCHELL
Indefinitely?

BETTY
(with a shrug)
I don't know.

MITCHELL
(eyeing her 
thoughtfully)
You don't know.

He turns and goes. She looks after him, puzzled and rather 
attracted. Then his mood passes and she relapses again 
into her listless, hopeless manner. She reaches for the 
magazine and starts to leaf through its pages indifferently, 
as we

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ROYAL HOTEL -- DAY

LONG SHOT

It is a massive brick and sandstone building, set in 
beautiful gardens which slope down towards Puget Sound.

CLOSER SHOT - THE ENTRANCE

A taxi drives up, Larry Mitchell and Betty get out, PORTER 
comes forward, takes their luggage etc. Larry pays taxi 
and they start in through entrance.

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - LOBBY - THE DESK -- DAY

Larry and Betty come up to it, BELLHOP carrying luggage.

HOTEL CLERK
Good afternoon, Mr. Mitchell.  
Have a mice trip? Glad to see you 
back.

MITCHELL
Fine, thanks. This is Miss Betty 
Mayfield. You have a reservation 
for her.

CLERK
Miss Mayfield. Yes, indeed. A 
balcony room on the top floor, 
Magnificent view. Nothing above it 
but the penthouse.

He pushes registration pad towards Betty, and she signs.  
Mitchell turns, looks out across lobby. A malicious smile 
move his lips.

MITCHELL'S POV

One side of the lobby is a glassed-in-terrace. It is tea 
time and a couple of large tea wagons are being pushed 
around among the guests by FOOTMEN in uniform. With each 
tea wagon are two neat MAIDS, who set out cups, pass 
sandwiches, cakes, etc., While the FOOTMAN pours the tea.

CLOSER SHOT

A tea wagon beside a table at which sit MR. CLARENDON and 
MARGO WEST. Mr. Clarendon is elegant, white-haired, 
aristocratic-looking, a cane and spats type. Margo is 
handsome, thirty-ish, almost overpoweringly well-dressed.  
Obviously money, obviously been around. Margo is studying 
her face in a pocket mirror. Tea wagon and maids move away.

MARGO
I'm getting positively haggard.  
In a couple of years people will 
be describing me as well preserved.

CLARENDON
(looking off)
I see out friend Larry Mitchell is 
with us again.

Margo's hand stops in mid-air, holding mirror. She looks 
up slowly.

MARGO
I couldn't care less.

Just the same, she sees in which direction. Clarendon is 
looking and starts to turn.

CLARENDON
And with a very beautiful girl, if 
my eyes don't deceive me at this 
distance.

Margo reacts and swings around, CAMERA PANNING.

Larry and Betty have turned away from the desk and are 
going towards elevators, BELLHOP behind them. Larry is 
bending towards Betty intimately. Margo turns back to 
Clarendon. Her face is frozen with a controlled emotion.

MARGO
I don't think I want any tea.

She picks up her bag and stands up. Goes out of shot.  
Clarendon looks after her with a malicious smile.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - MARGO'S SUITE - LIVING ROOM -- DAY

Its is very spacious, obviously expensive. It is empty at 
the moment. Margo unlocks door from outside, comes in, 
shuts and cocks door, walks swiftly into room, throws her 
bag viciously on the desk, yanks her hat off, throws it on 
chair. She goes over to the balcony window, takes cigarette 
out of box on the desk, her hand shakes as she lights it 
with lighter. She puffs at it furiously, looking out of 
window. After a moment, she snubs out in an ashtray, moves 
across to telephone, picks it up.

MARGO
(into phone)
Mr. Larry Mitchell, please
(a beat, she changes 
her mind)
No, never mind.

She puts telephone back in cradle and goes back to cigarette 
box, lights another cigarette in the same nervous, jerky 
manner, and puffs again. There is a KNOCK ON THE DOOR. She 
spins around, walks quickly to door, throws it open. 
Mitchell comes in. She says nothing as he moves in past 
her. She shuts the door.

MITCHELL
I'm afraid you're not very glad to 
see me, Margo.

MARGO
(between her teeth)
With your charm? How could I help 
it? Have a nice trip?

MITCHELL
So-so.

MARGO
Who's the girl?

MITCHELL
Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.

MARGO
Nice.

MITCHELL
She's just a girl I met on the 
train. You don't mind do you?

MARGO
(tartly)
Why should I mind?

MITCHELL
You shouldn't. You washed me up 
very thoroughly.

MARGO
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't 
easy. But you are helping me.

MITCHELL
(staring at her)
Margo, darling. You washed me up.  
Remember? We're just friends. You 
wanted it that way.

MARGO
(ignoring this)
She's very beautiful. She's much 
younger than I am. And she's rich, 
I hope.

MITCHELL
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. 
Why?

MARGO
You ought to know why.

MITCHELL
I don't. My hunch is she's just 
torn up an unhappy marriage. I was 
able to do her a small favor.

MARGO
Splendid. Now she can return the 
compliment.

She crosses the desk, gets bag, gets keys out, unlocks the 
desk drawer and jerks it open, takes something out and 
turns, holding it in her hand. Two checks.

MARGO
She can give you enough money to 
cover these... and the other bad 
checks you've given me.

Mitchell comes up to her slowly, looks down at the checks.

MITCHELL
I hoped to get enough to cover 
them before they cleared. I wasn't 
lucky.

MARGO
You know what would happen to you 
if I turned these over to the 
police?

MITCHELL
(quietly)
I have a rough idea.

MARGO
You'd go to jail. For a long term.

MITCHELL
Correct. I couldn't even afford to 
pay a lawyer to defend me.

A beat. They stare at each other.

MITCHELL
What'll we do about it, Margo?

MARGO
She is much younger than I am.  
That's something I'm going to have 
to get used to. Isn't it, Larry? 
They'll all be much younger than I 
am. Here.
(she holds out the 
checks)
Tear them up.

He takes them, puts them in his pocket and stands there 
looking at her. A sob catches in her throat.

MARGO
I guess I'm still in love with 
you, Larry. What an idiot!

He reaches to take her in his arms. First she pushes him 
off, then yields. He pulls her close and kisses her. Then, 
as they come out of the kiss,

MITCHELL
I've always been a heel. I guess I 
always will be.

MARGO
You don't have to make a pose of 
it.

MITCHELL
It's the only pose I have left.  
I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have 
my hotel bill.

MARGO
(a little sharply)
I seem to recognize this routine.  
First the kiss then the touch.
(she makes a hopeless 
gesture.)
Oh, what's the use. You're you.

She turns and moves towards the desk.

MARGO
I only have a couple of hundred.

She picks her bag up, holds it out. He comes up beside 
her.

MARGO
I seem to remember that you like 
to help yourself.

MITCHELL
(taking the bag)
That's not very kind.

MARGO
Kind or not kind. What's the 
difference? It always ends up the 
same way.

He gives her a twisted smile, opens the bag, rummages 
through it, opens the zipper pocket inside and comes out 
with some currency and looks over, puts it in his pocket.  
Puts the bag down on the desk, glances into the open drawer. 
His look becomes fixed.

MITCHELL'S POV (what he sees), SHOOTING DOWN INTO THE 
DRAWER, is a small, pearl-handled automatic, lying in the 
corner. Mitchell's hand goes down into it, takes the gun.

TWO-SHOT of Margo and Mitchell as his hand comes up with 
the gun.

MITCHELL
(almost amused)
What's this?

MARGO
What does it look like?

MITCHELL
How long have you had it?

MARGO
Years, why?

MITCHELL
It's against the law to cross the 
border with a gun. The Canadian 
police might like to know about 
this.

MARGO
(very quietly)
You already have the checks, 
darling.

MITCHELL
I didn't mean it that way
(he puts the gun 
back in the drawer, 
pushes the drawer 
shut.)
I'm sorry.

MARGO
Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's 
throwing a party up in his penthouse 
this evening. Take me?

MITCHELL
Of course.

MARGO
How about your new friend?

MITCHELL
(with a laugh)
I told you she's just..

MARGO
(cutting in sharply)
A girl you meet on the train.  
Excuse my bringing it up again.
(she glances at her 
wrist watch)
Be back in an hour. Right?

MITCHELL
Right.

MARGO
In an hour, Larry.

Mitchell stares at her levelly for a moment, then goes 
without a word.

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE MARGO'S ROOM -- DAY

Mitchell has just closed the door, stands with his hand on 
the knob, a smile playing across his features. He starts 
to whistle as he walks down the corridor. He takes a little 
dance step perhaps, this is to indicate that his whole 
attitude with Margo is just part of an act. He stops beside 
the big sand jar, lights a cigarette, drops the match in 
the jar, takes out the money from Margo's bag, flips it 
with a smile on his face, puts it back in his pocket, takes 
out the two checks Margo gave him, tears off the signatures, 
places checks in his pocket, tears the signature fragments 
into small pieces, drops them into the jar, goes on 
whistling.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - DESK AND ELEVATOR BANK -- DAY

A couple of GUESTS at the desk. A CLERK is handing out 
mail. CAMPBELL, the manager, is standing to one side. The 
elevator comes down. Mitchell comes out, crosses to the 
desk and addresses Campbell.

MITCHELL
Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.

CAMPBELL
(coldly)
Mr. Mitchell.

MITCHELL
(airily)
A little something on account 
perhaps?

CAMPBELL
Rather more than a little something, 
Mr. Mitchell.

MITCHELL
I'm afraid this is all for the 
moment.

Campbell picks up the money, counts it, puts it down.

CAMPBELL
I think we'd better discuss this 
in my office, Mr. Mitchell.

MITCHELL
Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the 
sun will shine even brighter. Be 
grateful for small mercies.

Campbell shrugs, reaches for the money.

MITCHELL
Oh, I forgot. I have a dinner 
engagement. Excuse me.

He removes a couple of bills from the money.

MITCHELL
Thank you, Mr. Campbell.

He puts money in his pocket, turns away. Campbell looks 
after him with cold anger. Mitchell dodges back into 
elevator just as it is about to start up.

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - BETTY'S ROOM -- DAY

Hat and suitcase in sight. Light is on in the closet. Betty 
is inside closet, hanging up clothes. As she comes out, 
switching off light, DOOR BUZZER SOUNDS. She opens door, 
Mitchell breezes on past her. She registers annoyance, 
then closes door. Mitchell crosses to the open French door 
of the balcony.

MITCHELL
Nice room. Balcony and everything. 
Lovely view too.

BETTY
(coolly)
Very nice Mitchell turns.

MITCHELL
No thanks?

BETTY
(same voice)
Thank you.

MITCHELL
(frowning)
Suppose I hadn't known that 
immigration inspector? Hadn't put 
in a good word for you?

BETTY
I'm supposing.

MITCHELL
I think you're a nice girl. I like 
you. But I can read signs if the 
print is large enough. It was your 
manner more than the wedding ring 
that bothered the inspector.  A 
sort of tenseness, as if you were 
afraid of something.

Betty just goes on looking at him.

MITCHELL
I have a darned good idea you're 
name isn't Betty Mayfield at all.

BETTY
Yes?

MITCHELL
How about taking to Uncle Larry 
into the old firm? He's a useful 
guy to have on your side.

BETTY
(no answer)

MITCHELL
(slight change of 
pace)
Don't get me wrong, Betty. I'm not 
suggesting you murdered anybody, 
you know.

Betty reacts. He sees the reaction. His smile broadens.  
Then very casually,

MITCHELL
Dine and dance tonight? I've got 
fifty bucks to throw away.

BETTY
Not tonight.

MITCHELL
What's the matter?

BETTY
I'm not in the mood for dining and 
dancing.

MITCHELL
We have some nice places around 
Vancouver.

BETTY
I'm sure you have.

MITCHELL
(puzzled a little)
Well, how about a breeze up to the 
penthouse about six o'clock?  A 
friend of mine is throwing a 
cocktail party up there.

BETTY
I haven't been invited.

MITCHELL
Nobody gets invited to Clark 
Brandon's parties. They just go.

BETTY
Perhaps I'd better get you 
straightened out, Mr. Mitchell.  
You've been rather nice to me, in 
a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. 
But I don't think this entitles 
you to put me on a leash.

MITCHELL
Nobody I'd rather have on a leash.

Betty crosses to the door and opens it.

BETTY
I'm awfully sorry, but I'd like to 
take a bath and get freshened up.

Mitchell hesitates, then comes across slowly to the door.

MITCHELL
The brush-off, huh?

BETTY
I'm trying very hard to be polite 
about it.

Mitchell grins, then suddenly reaches for her and kisses 
her. She doesn't struggle, is quite impassive. After a 
moment he let's go, steps back.

MITCHELL
Don't I even get my face slapped?

BETTY
(indicating the 
open door)
Would you mind?

MITCHELL
(a little puzzled, 
confused by her 
attitude)
Okay. You win.

HE STARTS OUT, TURNS TO SAY,

MITCHELL
If you change your mind about the 
cocktail party, or anything else, 
give me a buzz.

BETTY
If I change my mind.

He goes. He closes the door. CAMERA MOVES IN ON HER FACE.  
She wipes off her lips with her handkerchief, almost in an 
absentminded way. The kiss didn't mean anything to her, 
one way or another. There is great loneliness in her eyes.

FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - LOBBY -- NIGHT

WIDE SHOT

Showing a lot of activity, etc.

The time is 6:00 P.M. Approximately, but this is June in 
Canada and broad daylight, and will be for several hours 
yet.

In the background Betty comes in through glass doors from 
the garden terrace, walks slowly across the lobby.  People 
are looking at her with interest, specially the men.  As 
she reaches the elevator bank, she glances off to one side, 
past the desk. Her look becomes fixed.

CAMERA PANS AROUND TO SHOW A NEON SIGN "TAVERN" this side 
of an archway and people going in.

She turns away from elevator, starts in that direction, 
passes on beneath sign.

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - TAVERN -- NIGHT

As Betty come in, stands looking around. It is lighted 
somewhat dimly. There are a number of small tables,. There 
is a bar but it is only for the use of the waiters. Betty 
looks around for a vacant table, then starts moving along 
looking for one. None empty, but at one sits a MAN alone.  
He is about 35, clean fine drawn type, with a saturnine 
expression. He glances up. Betty meets his eyes, starts to 
turn away. Man indicates the chair opposite him. His manner 
of doing this is so completely indifferent to her as a 
person, that she hesitates.

BRANDON
(standing up)
You can have the table yourself, 
if you'd rather. I'm only killing 
time.

BETTY
No, please.

BRANDON
Sit down then. We often have a 
double up here.

BETTY
I see.

She pulls the chair back, sits down. Brandon sits down. He 
lights a cigarette, doesn't offer her one. She is watching 
him, a little puzzled, probably has had very few experiences 
of men not trying to pick her up in such circumstances. 
Betty looks around at the scurrying WAITERS who pay no 
attention to her yet.

BRANDON
(calling out sharply)
Oh waiter.

WAITER turns, sees him, immediately comes to stand at his 
side.

WAITER
Yes sir.

Brandon, without speaking, indicates Betty. Waiter turns 
to her.

WAITER
Yes, Miss.

BETTY
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, 
please.

WAITER
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only.  
Canadian law.

BETTY
(surprised)
Beer?
(she shrugs)
Well, all right.

WAITER
Beer or ale, Miss?

BETTY
Ale. I don't mind.

WAITER
Right, Miss.

He turns away. Brandon is smiling at her faintly, She meets 
his eyes, smiles back.

BETTY
(to Brandon)
Your liquor laws..

BRANDON
(cutting in)
Disgusting, aren't they? If you 
really want a Martini, I know where 
you can get one.

Betty looks inquiringly at him and doesn't speak.

BRANDON
A fellow named Brandon has a 
penthouse here. He's holding open 
house. I was up there. Too noisy.  
Bored.

BETTY
I see.

BRANDON
(indifferently)
It might be worth a Martini to 
you.

BETTY
I don't need it that badly. I don't 
enjoy crashing other people's 
parties.

BRANDON
It's open-house. No crashing 
involved. Anybody in the hotel's 
welcome.

BETTY
What did you say his name was?

BRANDON
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow 
about my age. Lot of money... that 
he didn't make. Former American. 
Now naturalized in Canada. Social 
standing indeterminate. Manners 
not quite perfect. Scotch superb.

BETTY
You don't sound as if you liked 
him very much.

BRANDON
(quietly)
No.. not very well. And I like his 
friends even less. But..
(he waves his hand 
indifferently)
If you really want a good dry 
Martini..

BETTY
As I said before...

BRANDON
Sure. But I'd hate like the Dickens 
to be held to everything I've said 
before, wouldn't you?

Betty suddenly laughs. The waiter brings the glass and the 
bottle of bass ale, sets them down in front of her. Brandon 
makes a motion and the waiter goes away without collecting.

BETTY
You're not paying for this. It's 
quite enough that you let me sit 
at your table.

BRANDON
I never pay for anything. They 
just keep me here to amuse the 
guests.

BETTY
And do you amuse the guests?

BRANDON
No.
(indicating her 
bottle of ale)
Are you really going to drink that 
stuff?

BETTY
You're drinking it.

BRANDON
(indicating his 
almost untouched 
glass)
I can be talked out of it. As a 
matter of fact, I'd like a dry 
Martini myself.

BETTY
Would it make you anymore amusing?

BRANDON
Whatever you say.

BETTY
I didn't say anything.

BRANDON
(standing up and 
putting money on 
the table)
I don't know you and you don't 
know me. I made a reasonably polite 
suggestion. But I'm sure you'd 
rather be alone.

BETTY
I hate to be alone. But I've heard 
all the approaches there are... 
even yours.

Brandon turns back, stares down at her coldly.

BRANDON
Neatly said...but to the wrong 
man. The trouble with pretty girls 
is that they can't imagine anyone 
thinking of anything else but the 
fact they are pretty girls. I get 
tired of it.

BETTY
(directly)
Do you think I don't?

BRANDON
(interested)
Thanks for the fresh air. That 
felt good.

BETTY
(standing up and 
taking her bag)
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?

BRANDON
He doesn't even know half the people 
who come up to drink his liquor.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ROYAL HOTEL - LOBBY/PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT

An elevator comes up. Brandon and Betty come out. There is 
a sound of revelry behind the penthouse door, opposite the 
elevators. They cross. Brandon opens the door casually, 
without bothering to ring, users Betty in.

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - PENTHOUSE- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

A big room, with French doors opening on a large terrace. 
A few couples are dancing outside on the terrace and a few 
more inside the room. There is a portable bar at one side 
of the room and two WAITERS behind it. The dance music is 
coming from a large Radio-Phonograph. Brandon and Betty 
come in. Brandon shuts the door. There are eighteen or 
twenty people around, with the usual alcoholic glitter in 
their eyes and the usual strident voices and exaggerated 
laughter.

CAMERA PANS BRANDON AND BETTY OVER TOWARDS THE BAR, 
DISCOVERING Mitchell leaning against it, staring morosely 
into a drink. He drains the last of it.

MITCHELL
(to bartender in a 
thick voice)
Another.

BARTENDER takes a glass. Brandon and Betty come up to the 
bar. Mitchell does not at first look up.

BRANDON
(to bartender)
This lady would like a dry Martini. 
So would I.

BARTENDER
Very good, sir.

He turns away. Mitchell looks up, sees Betty, reacts.

MITCHELL
Well well. Baby wouldn't come with 
me. Where did you pick her up?

Brandon glances from Betty to Mitchell puzzled, shrugs.

BRANDON
Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?

MITCHELL
The liquors lovely. The rest of 
the party you can have.

He moves towards Betty, puts an arm around her. Betty rises 
tries to pull away.

MITCHELL
What's the matter, baby. Don't you 
like me anymore?

BRANDON
(to Mitchell)
Lay off, can't you?

MITCHELL
Lay off what? This is my new girl 
friend. Met her on the train.  
She's very fond of me. Love at 
first sight. Wasn't it, baby?

Brandon reacts. There is a certain contempt in his look at 
Betty now. Bartender serves drinks impassively. Mitchell 
grabs his, gulps half of it down. Betty quietly releases 
herself and moves away from him.

BRANDON
And I'd begun to think this was my 
lucky day.

A liveried HOTEL SERVANT COMES INTO SHOT.

SERVANT
(to Brandon)
You're wanted on the telephone, 
Mr. Brandon. Mrs. West.

As the Servant says "Brandon", Betty reacts.

BRANDON
(to servant)
Thanks.
(to Betty with brutal 
sarcasm)
If you are a friend of Larry 
Mitchell's I'm sure I leave you in 
good hands.

He goes out of SHOT.

She looks after him unhappily.

CAMERA PANS BRANDON across his living room to an inner 
door.  He starts through.

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Telephone on table, receiver down as Brandon enters, close 
door against the noise.

BRANDON
(into phone)
Hello Margo. Aren't you coming up?
(a beat)
Mitchell? Oh yes, he's here.
(he smiles a little 
grimly)
He came up alone, but it seems he 
has a new girl friend with him 
now.
(a beat)
Don't be theatrical, Margo. What 
do you care about Mitchell? Come 
on up and have a drink.

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - MARGO'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

Margo on the phone.

MARGO
(in a flat voice)
I haven't any intensions of being 
theatrical. Of course I'll come 
up. Goodbye.

She hangs up, stand for a moment, staring at nothing, then 
she turns, picks her wrap out of the chair, puts it on, 
crosses to the desk for her handbag. She opens the bag, 
pauses, then in SLOW MOTION, pulls open the drawer of the 
desk.

CAMERA IN CLOSE, studies her face as she looks down into 
the drawer of the desk, which we do not see. But we already 
know there is a gun there. Her body is quite motionless, 
her expression frozen. When she moves we do not see whether 
she takes the gun out of the drawer or not.  We HEAR the 
SNAP of her bag shutting. The she turns away, starts across 
the room to leave.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - ELEVATOR IN MOTION UP -- NIGHT

A quiet, gentlemanly-looking MAN is leaning against the 
back wall of the elevator, wearing a trench coat and a 
soft hat. He is a homicide dick named KILLAINE, but you'd 
never think that to look at him. Elevator stops, doors 
open, and Margo enters.

ELEVATOR BOY
(very polite)
Did you have a nice day, Mrs.  
West?

MARGO
I had a rotten day, if its any of 
your business.

ELEVATOR BOY
I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. West.

MARGO
Don't let it break you up.

ELEVATOR BOY
Oh, I wouldn't do that, Mrs.  West.

The man chuckles, Margo looks around at him.

MARGO
What's so funny?

Killaine wipes the smile off his face.

KILLAINE
(imitating boy)
I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. West.

As she stares at him, he takes his monocle out of his 
pocket, polishes it, sticks it in his eye.

MARGO
Oh, the Coldstream Guards.
(a beat)
Don't you take your hat off in 
elevators?

KILLAINE
(pleasantly)
I never wear a hat.
(his face changes 
to consternation)
Oh, so I am. I forgot.
(he takes his hat 
off)
I guess I'm terribly sorry again, 
Mrs. West.

Elevator stops.

ELEVATOR BOY
Penthouse floor, please.

Margo sweeps out, Killaine follows her.

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - PENTHOUSE FLOOR - LOBBY -- NIGHT

As they cross to the Penthouse door.

KILLAINE
May I?

He pushes the button.

MARGO
May you what?

KILLAINE
Oh nothing.

MARGO
Are you always this witty?

Killaine laughs as the door opens. Brandon stands in it.

BRANDON
Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two 
come together?

MARGO
In the same elevator. It is a public 
conveyance.

CAMERA TAKES THEM INTO THE ROOM the door starts to close.

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

Brandon, Killaine and Margo standing by the door.

BRANDON
Let me introduce you. Mr.  Killaine, 
Mrs. West.

MARGO
(not looking at 
Killaine)
Fascinated.

Her eyes roam the room. She picks out Mitchell. Her 
expression freezes.

MARGO'S POV

WHAT SHE SEES -- Betty is sitting in her chair in a corner 
and Mitchell is standing over her, his hand on the back of 
the chair. Her expression is wooden. His is a mixture of 
insolence and pleading.

CAMERA RETURNS TO MARGO, BRANDON AND KILLAINE as they cross 
to the bar.

At the same time Mitchell leaves Betty, also crosses to 
the bar, reaches it about the same time as Margo. Margo 
gives Mitchell a long, cool, empty stare. Mitchell smiles 
a little sheepishly, embarrassed even in his drunkenness.

BRANDON
What'll you have, Margo?

MARGO
(without looking at 
him)
Martini.

BRANDON
(to Killaine)
You, Killaine?

KILLAINE
Scotch and plain water, I think.

MARGO
(not looking at him)
Warm water, no doubt.

BRANDON
What?

KILLAINE
A private joke.

He gets the monocle out and sticks it in his eye again.

KILLAINE
It goes with this... cold houses 
and warm drinks...the effete 
Englishman.

BRANDON
You're not English.

Bartender serves drinks. Margo puts her bag down on the 
bar. It makes a heavy CLUNKING SOUND. KILLAINE'S eyes go 
to it, without too much expression. Mitchell reacts more. 
To him the clunking sound has a meaning. He starts to reach 
for the bag. Margo pointedly moves it away from him.

MITCHELL
(to Margo thickly)
I'm sorry. I forgot about calling 
for you.

MARGO
It's quite unimportant, Mr.  
Mitchell. After all, you got what 
you wanted.

MITCHELL
Be nasty.

MARGO
I have no intension of being nasty, 
Mr. Mitchell.

MITCHELL
In that case, there's someone here 
I'd like to introduce to you. Over 
there.

Margo looks towards Betty. She reacts.

MARGO
(almost to herself)
She is beautiful. And young.
(she turns back to 
Mitchell)
No thank you.

MITCHELL
(aggressively)
I say YES!

Margo quietly turning her back on him and reaching for her 
glass.

MARGO
You're not the type to be masterful, 
darling. It takes character.

Mitchell reaches for her shoulder and spins her around, 
causing her to slop some of her drink out on the bar.

MARGO
(with sudden deadly 
sweetness)
Of course, darling. Anything you 
say.

She goes off with Mitchell. Killaine looks after then 
puzzled. Brandon is indifferent.

KILLAINE
That's what I like about cocktail 
parties. Everyone is so perfectly 
natural.

BRANDON
How's life treating you?

KILLAINE
The usual grind.

BRANDON
Round of golf Saturday?

KILLAINE
If I can get off.

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

CORNER OF THE ROOM

Betty is sitting alone as Margo and Mitchell COME INTO 
SHOT.

MITCHELL
Betty, this is Margo West. She 
wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.

BETTY
How do you do?

MARGO
(staring at her)
You're very attractive, my dear.  
And you look very unsophisticated.

MITCHELL
Unsophisticated?
(he laughs nastily)
If I knew about this babe...

Betty stands up quickly.

BETTY
I think I'd like to dance.

MITCHELL
Why certainly, baby.

He puts his arm around Betty and dances off with her, 
leaving Margo standing.

CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM as they dance.

They pass Mr. Clarendon, who is sitting as usual with his 
sliver-haired cane between his legs, paying no particular 
attention to anything.

BETTY
(to Mitchell as 
they dance)
Please be a little more careful 
how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.

MITCHELL
How careful should I be?

BETTY
I don't like being referred to as 
babe, or addressed as baby. I don't 
like your possessive attitude, nor 
your hints of secret knowledge. In 
fact, to be very frank, Mr. 
Mitchell, I don't think I like 
you.

MITCHELL
Maybe you're going to have to like 
me.

He disengages her left hand enough to hold it up and look 
at it.

MITCHELL
You've shed the ring, haven't you? 
Took my advice. That's the girl. 
Keep right on taking my advice and 
we'll get somewhere.

Betty jerks away from him and stops.

BETTY
I think you're drunk.

MITCHELL
Just drunk enough.

He puts his arm around her, pulls her close to him, and 
tilts her head back. She struggles against him, silently.  
He pushes her head back father and kisses her solidly on 
the mouth. She finally breaks away from him with flashing 
eyes.

MITCHELL
What's the matter, baby? Don't you 
like being kissed?

BETTY
(with cold fury)
Next time you try that, Mr.  
Mitchell...
(a beat, she takes 
a deep breath, 
then very pointedly)
..don't. I'm warning you.

BRANDON AND MARGO COME INTO SHOT FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS

BRANDON
Do me a favor, Mitchell. Find 
yourself a nice secluded park bench.

MITCHELL
(airily)
Did I do something wrong?

BRANDON
I wouldn't know. Just do it 
somewhere else. There is such a 
thing as good manners.

MITCHELL
How would you know, Brandon?

BRANDON
(harshly)
Want to walk out... or get thrown 
out?

MITCHELL
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.

BRANDON
Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric.

The two men glare at each other. Mitchell finally shrugs 
then goes towards the door.

MARGO
(to Brandon, quietly)
It takes two to clinch.  Clark.  
Nice to have seen you.

She starts towards the door. Brandon hurries quickly to 
open it for her. She goes without looking at him, her mouth 
tight. He shuts the door, looks back towards Betty, who 
has remained standing perfectly still. She takes a 
handkerchief out of her bag and scrubs her mouth off as 
Brandon comes back to her. Clarendon stands up slowly.

BRANDON
(to Betty, offhand)
Dance?

BETTY
No thank you.

CLARENDON
(to Brandon)
Where I come from, Mr. Brandon, 
the host tries to protect his guests 
from insult.

BRANDON
I stopped him.

CLARENDON
And if he fails, he at least has 
the good manners to apologize.

BRANDON
I don't exactly regard Larry 
Mitchell's pick-ups...

Clarendon turns back on him. Then--

CLARENDON
(to Betty, with 
courtly gesture)
We haven't been introduced. But if 
you'll overlook that, I'm sure 
that between us we can contrive a 
graceful exit.

BETTY
(smiling at him 
warmly)
Thank you very much.

They go towards the door side by side.

Brandon turns and CAMERA PANS HIM BACK TO BAR where Killaine 
has remained motionless, his drink untasted.

BRANDON
Would it have helped if I'd knocked 
him down?

KILLAINE
Hardly. Who's the girl?

BRANDON
Somebody Mitchell picked up on the 
train. I don't even know her name.

KILLAINE
She doesn't look like a girl who 
would let herself be picked up on 
a train.

BRANDON
That's what I thought, at first.
(a beat)
Maybe somebody else ought to have 
thrown this party.
(a beat)
With my liquor of course.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - BETTY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

CLOSE SHOT

Face of traveling clock on a night table. Room is dark, 
lit only by moonlight. Hands of the clock stand almost 
11:15. Ticking is HEARD faintly. A little smoke drifts 
across the face of the clock.

CAMERA PANS BACK ALONG THE SMOKE to Betty lying in bed, 
her eyes wide open. Somewhere outside a CHURCH CLOCK CHIMES 
the quarter hour. The last strokes of the clock are drowned 
out by a sudden peal of THUNDER. Betty jerks upright in 
bed.  The thunder frightens her. There is another LOUDER 
peal, this time preceded by a FLASH of LIGHTENING which 
LIGHTS UP HER FACE. She shuts her eyes against it. The 
THUNDERSTORM grows suddenly HEAVY. Repeated FLASHES of 
LIGHTENING across her FACE and peals of THUNDER.

CAMERA MOVES IN ON HER EYES which are frozen.

FLASHBACK:

INT. COUNTY COURTHOUSE - GREENWATER NORTH CAROLINA -- 
NIGHT

CAMERA PULLS BACK VERY SLOWLY

And everything has changed except Betty's expression. The 
FLASHES go on, but they are now seen to be FLASHBULBS of 
NEWSPAPER CAMERAMEN. Betty is dressed very soberly and is 
standing just inside the door of a courtroom with a jail 
matron beside her.

The CAMERA KEEPS PULLING BACK AWAY FROM BETTY, and the 
entire courtroom is seen.

It is late at night in the county courthouse GREENWATER, 
NORTH CAROLINA. There is an excited buzzing of conversation. 
A BAILIFF is RAPPING for order.

The JURY is sitting, grim faced and silent, in the box. 
The Judge is not on the bench yet.

Betty is led along the side corridor then through the bar 
where DEFENSE ATTORNEY, a haggard, dark-haired young man, 
stands waiting for her.

(NOTE: All Southern accents except Betty's in this scene)

BAILIFF
(shouting)
Everybody stand up! His Honor, 
Judge Hopkinson! Court now in 
session!

Everybody stands up. Betty and the jail matron and the 
young attorney face towards the bench.

CAMERA SHOWS THE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY, also standing up at 
his table.

CAMERA PANS OVER TO THE DOOR OF THE JUDGES CHAMBERS. He 
walks slowly to the bench, stands for a moment behind it, 
looking out over the courtroom, then sits down. He is a 
distinguished courtly Southerner of the best type, an old 
man but very erect. When he sits, all the spectators and 
lawyers sit down.

The double doors at the back are closed and a BAILIFF stands 
with his back to them. Suddenly, one of the doors is pushed 
open, almost knocking the Bailiff out of the way.

He turns angrily as HENRY KINSOLVING enters. The Bailiff 
seeing who it is, stands aside. Henry Kinsolving is an 
arrogant, bitter man about 60 years old, with the stamp of 
power and authority. He marches down the center aisle of 
the court through the bar, and sits at the table near the 
PROSECUTOR. The Judge stares down at him coldly.

JUDGE
Mr. Bailiff, please make room for 
Mr. Henry Kinsolving, outside the 
bar of the court.

Henry Kinsolving springs to his feet and glares at the 
Judge. Then he turns and goes through the gate of the bar 
and sits down outside in a chair the Bailiff places for 
him solicitously. There is a general shuffling of feet and 
noise which subsides slowly.

JUDGE
(slowly and 
impressively)
Before the Jury renders its verdict, 
the Court wishes to warn those 
present that there is to be no 
demonstrations of any kind. No 
person is to leave the courtroom 
until the Court rises.
(he glances towards 
press table)
I repeat... no one is to leave the 
courtroom.

There is a silence, then the Judge turns towards the Clerk.

JUDGE
You may proceed, Mr. Clerk.

CLERK
(he stands and looks 
at Elizabeth)
The Defendant will rise and face 
the Jury.

ELIZABETH stands up slowly and turns towards the Jury, who 
do not look at her. They stare somewhere over her head. 
The Clerk turns back to the Jury.

CLERK
Gentlemen of the Jury, have you 
reached a verdict?

FOREMAN
(standing)
We have.

CLERK
And what is your verdict?

FOREMAN
We the Jury, find the Defendant, 
Elizabeth Kinsolving, guilty of 
murder in the first degree.

There is a surge of noise in the well of the court. The 
Judge raps sharply with his gavel. A couple of PRESSMEN 
start to get up, then look back and see that the doors are 
guarded and sit down again. The Prosecutor looks grimly 
satisfied; he glances at the DEFENDING COUNCIL with a half 
smile. Defense Counsel, whose name is LEAMINGTON, is shocked 
and pale. Elizabeth shows no reaction at all. Henry 
Kinsolving draws his mouth a little tighter, and there is 
a gleam in his eye. The Spectators look, for the most part, 
very satisfied. Leamington comes to his feet.

LEAMINGTON
(in a strangled 
voice)
Motion to pool the Jury, if it 
please the Court.

JUDGE
So ordered.

The Clerk now proceeds to poll the Jury, saying "Juror No. 
1 what is your verdict?" And the Juror answering "Guilty 
of murder in the first degree." "Juror No. 2, what is your 
verdict?" Etc. This is covered by a series of CLOSE UPS 
all answer clearly until the Clerk comes to Juror No. 7, 
who mumbles in a low voice.

CLERK
(to Juror No. 7)
Speak a little louder please.

Juror No. 7 is staring hard at Elizabeth. His face is 
twisted with emotion. He is the only Juror who has looked 
at her. He swallows, doesn't answer, then his eyes go to 
Henry Kinsolving. Henry Kinsolving glares at Juror No. 7.  
Juror No. 7 wilts.

JUROR NO. 7
(thickly and 
hesitatingly)
Guilty of murder in the first 
degree.

The Clerk completes the polling of the Jury, then turns to 
the Judge. The Judge nods and Clerk sits down. The courtroom 
starts to get noisy again, and the Judge uses his gavel.

BAILIFF
Order in the Court!

JUDGE
The Court now has a statement to 
make.

He glances towards Elizabeth, who is still standing rigidly.

JUDGE
(gently)
Please sit down, Mrs. Kinsolving.

Elizabeth sits, and clasps her hands in front of her.

JUDGE
This court, like most courts, has 
occasionally been guilty of judicial 
error. Prior to the commencement 
of this trail, Mr.  Leamington, as 
attorney for the Defendant, made a 
motion for a change of venue on 
the ground that a fair trial could 
not be had by this Defendant in 
this jurisdiction. Most of you 
know why this motion was made.  
The Defendant was alleged to have 
been tried and convicted in the 
columns of the daily newspaper 
owned by her father-in-law, Mr.  
Henry Kinsolving, and as a result 
public opinion was said to have 
been prejudiced to the extent that 
it was doubtful twelve Jurors could 
be found with open minds. This 
Court regretfully denied the motion. 
It did not believe that a Jury 
with open minds could not be found. 
The members of this Jury declared 
on oath that their minds were open.  
The Court had no reason at that 
time to disbelieve them.

The Judge looks at the Jury sternly, and they react in 
various ways. The Judge's eyes go to Henry Kinsolving, who 
stares back at him.

JUDGE
Elizabeth Kinsolving has been tried 
and found guilty of murder of her 
husband, Lee Kinsolving.  Lee 
Kinsolving was the only son of our 
most prominent citizen.  Mr. 
Kinsolving controls, or is said to 
control, our leading bank, many of 
our business enterprises and our 
only daily newspaper. He affords 
employment to a large number of 
our citizens. His influence on our 
affairs is very great.
(dramatic pause)
Perhaps to great.

There is an upsurge of noise in the Court and the Bailiff 
shots for order. Prosecutor jumps to his feet.

PROSECUTOR
Your Honor, I protest that 
statement!

JUDGE
Sit down, Mr. Prosecutor. Your are 
out of order.

Prosecutor swallows, looks back at Henry Kinsloving, shrugs 
and sits down again. Leamington is leaning forward with a 
gleam in his eye. Elizabeth is still deadpan.

JUDGE
We all new Lee Kinsolving well, We 
watched him grow up.  We observed 
that he was proud and hot tempered, 
and had a strain of arrogance, not 
unlike others of his family.

He looks meaningfully at Henry Kinsolving.

JUDGE
From this town Lee Kinsolving went 
to fight for his country.  And to 
this town, before he went overseas, 
he brought the wife he had married 
up North. To us he returned a war 
hero badly wounded, condemned for 
the rest of his life to wear a 
heavy brace around his neck. 
Competent medical testimony has 
shown that without that brace a 
very slight movement might have 
been enough to snap his spinal 
cord. This injury humiliated and 
embittered Lee Kinsolving, made 
him morose and violent, and perhaps 
caused him to drink to excess. The 
Defendant has admitted that there 
were bitter quarrels between herself 
and her husband. Such a quarrel 
took place on the night of his 
death, Upon the manner of that 
death this entire proceeding rests.

The Judge pauses and looks out over the courtroom, which 
is very quiet now, He pours himself a glass of water and 
takes a drink from it.

JUDGE
In my summing up to the Jury I 
emphasized that the case for the 
prosecution was, as so many murder 
cases are, purely circumstantial. 
It was alleged that while Lee 
Kinsolving slept, perhaps in a 
drunken stupor and perhaps not, 
the Defendant removed the neck 
brace from his neck and jerked his 
head sufficiently to rupture the 
spinal cord and cause death. It is 
admitted that the Defendant was 
found holding the neck brace in 
her hand, and bending over her 
husband's body, which was lying on 
the bed. Not in the bed, mind you, 
but sprawled across it.  The 
Defendant has testified that lee 
Kinsolving himself removed the 
neck brace to torment her, as it 
were, with the great danger in 
which this placed him. Then he 
started to walk towards her, holding 
the brace in his hands, and that 
being unsteady on his feet, he 
stumbled and fell backwards across 
the bed. And this fall broke his 
neck, although at the time she did 
not know it. She has testified 
that she picked the brace up from 
the floor and was about to attempt 
to replace it on his neck when her 
father-in-law entered the room and 
found her in that position.
(a beat)
By its verdict the Jury declared 
that Elizabeth Kinsolving's account 
of the death of her husband to be 
impossible of belief.

The Judge sips a little more water, then continues.

JUDGE
In all murder trails, a motion by 
the Defense for a directed verdict 
of acquittal before the case goes 
to the Jury is more or less 
automatic. It is usually 
perfunctory, and for that reason 
immediately denied. The laws of 
this state, and a few other 
jurisdictions, confer upon a Court 
a right to reserve its ruling upon 
such a motion until after the Jury 
has rendered its verdict. In this 
proceeding, I, as presiding Judge, 
availed myself of this power. I 
most honestly hoped that the Jury 
in this case might act as 
impartially as it declared itself 
to be.

The Prosecuting Attorney again jumps to his feet, then 
changes his mind, sits down with a frustrated angry 
movement. Kinsolving is leaning forward, glaring. The Jury 
are now very uncomfortable. The is a BUZZ OF NOISE and the 
Bailiff again shouts for order.

JUDGE
Let me remind you that a Jury is 
the sole Judge of fact, and further 
let me remind you that the Jury 
must judge all the facts. It may 
not select nor create nor change 
facts. It may only interpret them. 
It may not declare something 
impossible which in fact is merely 
extremely difficult to believe.
(a beat)
Impossible is a very big word.
(another beat.)
If we believe Elizabeth Kinsolving's 
sworn testimony, we must also 
believe that Lee Kinsolving 
performed an act which was almost 
certain to cause his death. It is 
difficult... very difficult to 
believe. But is it impossible? Are 
we sure that he knew it would cause 
his death? Or that in his then 
state of mind, he even considered 
the consequences at all? Many people 
have attempted suicide as a result 
of domestic quarrels. Not all have 
succeeded, nor meant to succeed. 
And surely not all those who did 
succeed... fully intended to. Not 
all knew what they were doing and 
those who did know, there were 
surely a few whose desire to hurt 
others overcame their fear of 
hurting themselves.  We cannot 
know what was in Lee Kinsolving's 
Mind. Therefore, some element of 
doubt must infallibly remain. It 
was not necessary for this Jury to 
declare its belief in the 
Defendant's innocence, nor to 
declare its that Lee Kinsolving by 
accident or his own intent. It was 
necessary for the Jury to admit to 
themselves, as reasonable men, the 
possibility.... however slight... 
that Elizabeth Kinsolving's story 
was true. This possibility the 
Jury has refused to admit.
(dramatic pause)
It therefore becomes my duty to 
declare that such a possibility 
does in fact exist... and the Jury's 
refusal to recognize it was a 
failure to exercise it proper 
function.

A rising, antagonistic sound begins to surge from the 
spectators and Henry Kinsolving comes to his feet, slowly 
and rigidly. The Judge ignore him and looks straight at 
the foreman of the Jury, and speaks the rest of his speech 
in a clear, ringing, dominating voice.

JUDGE
The Court therefore rules that the 
motion of the Attorney for the 
Defense for a directed verdict of 
not guilty be now granted. The 
verdict of guilty brought by this 
Jury is herby set aside, and a 
verdict of not guilty is to be 
entered on the record.
(his voice bow rises 
almost to a shout)
And the Defendant, Elizabeth 
Kinsolving, is here with discharged 
from custody of the Sheriff of 
this county.

PANDEMONIUM and UPROAR in the Court. The Bailiff shouts 
for order. The Judge stands slowly, looks a moment out 
over the Court, then looks at Elizabeth, smiles at her 
faintly, turns, and starts back towards his chambers.

CAMERA PANS over to Henry Kinsolving. He stands like a 
statue, an icy rage, his face working, while behind him 
the noise of the spectators goes on. Kinsolving turns his 
head towards Elizabeth, then moves stiffly over to her.

CAMERA PANNING, he comes over to her. Leamington, the 
Defense Attorney, and the matron are standing beside her.

KINSLOVING
(with restrained 
fury)
For four years I endured your 
presence in my house, although I 
well knew you were no fit wife for 
my son.. That he had married in 
haste, and that he would repent it 
bitterly if he survived the war. I 
had no thought that he would die 
under his own roof, nor that the 
reward of my patience would be to 
stand beside his grave. I have 
done my best to avenge him. So far 
I have failed.  But I have not 
finished. You are free to go where 
you will, but there will be another 
day of reckoning, somewhere, 
sometime.  And when that day comes, 
I will be there. And that time you 
will not escape.

Elizabeth's eyes widen with horror. In the background the 
crowd is still roaring, like peals of thunder.

CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE TO ELIZABETH'S EYES as at the 
beginning of this flashback.

FLASH FORWARD:

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - BETTY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

CAMERA WITHDRAWS and find her sitting up in bed in the 
ROYAL HOTEL. THUNDER is pealing outside, but now more 
distantly. There is a sudden downpour of RAIN. Betty sweeps 
the bedclothes aside. Reaches for a robe, and crosses to 
close the French doors. Over her shoulder we see a portion 
of the small balcony, a chaise, and as Betty starts to 
close the door, she stops frozen. There is someone lying 
on the chaise. She starts out into the rain.

EXT. ROYAL HOTEL - BETTY'S BALCONY -- NIGHT

As she comes out, approaches the chaise, leans down, the 
rain beating on her. She shakes the shoulder of a man on 
the chaise. He doesn't move. One of his hands drops limply 
and swings a little. Horror shows in Betty's eyes. She 
reaches out and touches the man's face and WE SEE for the 
first time that this is Larry Mitchell, and we realize 
that he is dead.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - PORTER'S DESK/CORRIDOR/MAIN FLOOR -- 
NIGHT

The NIGHT PORTER is seated at his desk, reading a paper. 
He is a middle-aged man in uniform and military bearing, 
with a row or ribbons across his chest. Probably, in order 
of seniority, a Military Medal, a Good Conduct Medal, the 
Long Service Medal, and two or three campaign ribbons. 
Betty, now fully dressed, COMES SLOWLY INTO THE SHOT and 
stops by his desk. Porter lays down his paper and stands 
up.

PORTER
Good evening, Miss.

BETTY
How soon can I get a plane to 
Seattle?

PORTER
I'm afraid there's nothing more 
tonight, Miss. Unless you charter 
a plane.

BETTY
How long would that take?

PORTER
Well... they have to service the 
plane... and get a pilot down to 
the field, unless there's one 
hanging around there still... and 
then they have to get the 
immigration officer...

BETTY
Immigration Officer?

PORTER
Crossing the border this time of 
night they're a bit particular.  
You'd have to prove your identity, 
you know... unless you've got a 
passport. They might even want to 
know why you're in such a hurry.
(he grins)
Otherwise they might think...

He breaks off, staring at her.

BETTY
They might think I was running 
away from something.

PORTER
Possibly, Miss.

He smiles.

BETTY
Thank you very much.

She turns and exits. CAMERA FOLLOWS HER ALONG. She turns 
the corner by the elevator bank, starts into the elevator.  
Brandon is standing there in a light overcoat, with his 
hat in his hand. She get's in without noticing him.

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - ELEVATOR IN MOTION UP -- NIGHT

BRANDON
Leaving us so soon, Miss Mayfield?

She realizes his presence.

BRANDON
I don't blame you.. For running 
away.

Betty reacts sharply, controls herself, says nothing.  
Elevator stops, doors open.

ELEVATOR BOY
Good night, Miss.

BETTY
Good night.

She starts out. Brandon after her.

ELEVATOR BOY
This isn't the penthouse floor, 
Mr. Brandon.

Brandon keeps going.

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ELEVATOR -- NIGHT

Betty is walking quickly down the corridor towards her 
room. Brandon is following her. She seems unaware of him.

BRANDON
(calling)
Miss Mayfield...

Betty stops turns, and he comes up to her.

BRANDON
I know it's a littler late for an 
apology.

BETTY
(in a strained, un 
natural voice)
Much too late.

BRANDON
Don't take it so big... it isn't a 
tragedy.

Betty goes into a peal of hysterical laughter, Brandon 
grabs hold of her arm and shakes it.

BRANDON
What's the matter with you?

Betty stops laughing just as suddenly as she began.

BETTY
You said it wasn't a tragedy.

BRANDON
What's funny about that? If you 
pick up people like Larry Mitchell 
other people are bound to get funny 
ideas about you. The world is full 
of Larry Mitchells.

BETTY
There's one less tonight.

Brandon reacts. Silently she holds out a key. He takes it.  
It's a tabbed hotel room key.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - BETTY'S ROOM -- NIGHT

DOOR OPENS

Brandon comes in, stands aside as Betty comes in. He shuts 
and locks the door. The room is lighted up. Brandon looks 
around swiftly.

BETTY
Out on the balcony.

CAMERA PANS Brandon across the room to the balcony door, 
he steps out.

EXT. ROYAL HOTEL - BETTY'S BALCONY -- NIGHT

Brandon enters. He goes quickly to chaise, stares down, 
bends, appears to pick something up. What is it not seen.

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - BETTY'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Betty is standing motionless in the middle of the floor.

BRANDON
Through the heart, apparently.  
Very little blood. What's the story?

Betty looks him straight in the eye.

BETTY
There isn't one.. That anyone would 
believe. I went for a walk after 
dinner, down to the ocean...alone... 
I came up and went to bed. I didn't 
sleep very well. Then there was a 
thunderstorm. And it began to rain.  
I went across to close the French 
door. That's the first time I saw 
him out there.

BRANDON
He got in here how?

BETTY
Not with my consent, strange as it 
seems. I don't know how he got in. 
I don't know anything.

Brandon brings his hand up.

BRANDON
Ever see this before?

Betty looks down. In his hand is an automatic with a pearl 
handle.

BETTY
No. And I've never fired a gun in 
my life, Aren't you supposed not 
to touch it?

BRANDON
Sure... but somebody always does..

He puts the gun down on the table carelessly, gets out a 
cigarette case and offers her one. She takes it and he 
lights it for her. Her hand is shaky. Their faces are very 
close together. He holds the lighter close to her eyes.

BRANDON
(quietly)
Lovely eyes... honest eyes..

The light goes out.

BRANDON
They'll know whether he killed 
himself.

BETTY
I don't.

BRANDON
How did you meet him?

BETTY
On a train. He said he lived here, 
and he offered to make a reservation 
for me.

BRANDON
Nice of him.

BETTY
He knew the immigration officer.  
He eased himself in.

BRANDON
He was a great boy for that. What 
else?

BETTY
That's all there is.

Brandon takes her by the shoulders and pulls her close, 
looking into her eyes.

BRANDON
They're still honest eyes... but 
there's something behind them.

He pulls her closer, about to kiss her.

BETTY
Go ahead...if you want to. It 
doesn't matter.

BRANDON
I'd rather wait until it does 
matter.

He lets go of her and starts across the room, picks up 
telephone. Brandon turns with the telephone in his hand.

BRANDON
You tried to run away.

BETTY
There wasn't any plane.

BRANDON
It's always a mistake to run away. 
Always.

He begins to dial.

FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

Brandon is standing at the French window, a cup of coffee 
in his hand. CAMERA PULLS BACK AS his eyes go over to Betty 
who is in a chair with an untouched cup of black coffee on 
the table beside her.

BRANDON
(going towards her)
Want a spike in it?

BETTY
(without looking at 
him)
No thanks.

Her voice and expression are dead and exhausted. CAMERA 
PULLS BACK FURTHER to SHOW Margo and Clarendon sitting 
across the room from Betty. Margo is staring at Betty with 
cold hostility. She is wearing slacks, but otherwise dressed 
with care and finish. Clarendon is fully dressed and has 
his silver-topped cane between his legs, but has slippers 
on his feet.

MARGO
You make friends quickly, don't 
you, Clark?

BRANDON
Sometimes.

MARGO
And without much discrimination.

BRANDON
Leave that one lay.

MARGO
They still hang women in Canada, 
I've heard.

CLARENDON
So much less refined than frizzling 
them in the chair.

MARGO
Oh, shut up!
(she looks down at 
his feet)
You haven't even got your spats 
on.

Brandon crosses to coffee table, picks up coffee pot and 
goes to Margo with it.

MARGO
Think I'll have trouble staying 
awake?

Brandon fills her cup silently. Margo chokes. Bites on her 
handkerchief hard. She controls herself.

MARGO
I'm sorry. This thing has just 
knocked me silly.  How long do we 
have to wait for this police 
character?

BRANDON
Until he comes. He's a nice guy.  
You've met him.

MARGO
That comedian?

Betty looking across at Brandon with sudden interest.

BRANDON
Don't let the eyeglass fool you.  
That's what it's for.

DOOR BUZZER SOUNDS. Brandon crosses to open door. A plain-
clothes Dick named HANDLEY is standing there.

HANDLEY
You Mr. Brandon?

Brandon nods.

HANDLEY
Inspector Killaine's compliments.  
He'll be up in another ten minutes.

Brandon nods again, and as Handley starts to turn away, 
Brandon starts to close the door.

CUT TO:

EXT. ROYAL HOTEL - BETTY'S BALCONY -- NIGHT

Portable lights have been rigged up and a POLICE 
PHOTOGRAPHER is taking photographs of the body. As he 
finishes, a sheet is thrown over it and the photographer 
starts to dismantle his equipment and pack it up. A couple 
of PLAIN-CLOTHES MEN are standing around, and one of them 
named GORE, a detective sergeant, a big sore-head who 
doesn't like anybody. As the photographer extinguishes one 
of the lights and starts to wind up the cord, Gore looks 
off and scowls.

Killiane ENTERS SHOT briskly. He is wearing a trenchcoat 
and no hat.

GORE
You in charge here?

KILLAINE
So it seems Sergeant.

GORE
Right.

KILLAINE
I hate to pull rank on you Sergeant, 
but once in a while...for moral 
purposes...you might address me as 
"Inspector". In moments of extreme 
desperation, you might even call 
me "sir".

He goes over to the chaise, lifts the sheet off corpse, 
looks down, replaces sheet, comes back to Gore.

KILLAINE
I knew him. He was easy to dislike, 
poor chap.

GORE
They tell me he'll be a great loss 
to the liquor trade. This Mayfield 
girl...

He breaks off as Killaine reacts

GORE
... I supposed you knew her, too, 
Inspector.

KILLAINE
I've met her.

GORE
It's her room. She only got to the 
Hotel this afternoon,. With him.
(he indicates body 
on chaise)
I guess he took too much for 
granted. Here's the gun.

He takes it out of his pocket and holds it out on a 
handkerchief. Killaine takes the gun from him, handkerchief 
and all.

KILLAINE
Pearl-handled .25 Automatic, uh?
(he looks a little 
closer)
No, it's a Belgian gun... 6.6 mm.

GORE
Correct, Inspector. A woman's gun. 
U.S. 125 caliber ammunition in it. 
It was on a table in there.

He nods towards room. Killaine frowns.

GORE
Nobody's been questioned yet. You 
noticed the wound entry?

Killaine nods.

GORE
Much too low for a suicide. Not 
conclusive, of course. But a woman 
of ordinary height, standing rather 
close to a tall man, such as he 
was...
(indicating corpse)
...would be apt to shoot him about 
where he got shot.

Killaine nods again.

GORE
Then there's the shell.

He takes out a small envelope, hands it to Killaine.

GORE
This make of gun throws a shell 
backwards, high, and to the right. 
The chaise is only about four feet 
from the wall.

KILLAINE
So the shell ought to have gone 
over?

GORE
Unless the gun was slanted up.

KILLAINE
So the wound and the shell give 
you the same answer.

GORE
Right. A clean deduction from 
observed facts. They've got to be 
simple once in a while, Inspector.

KILLAINE
(dryly)
I've always looked forward to it.  
All right, let's get him out of 
here and tidy up.

He starts to turn away.

GORE
I'd take a look in her clothes 
closet if I were you, Inspector.

Killaine nods and exits scene.

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - BETTY'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Killaine enters from the balcony then stands a moment, 
looking around, crosses to dressing table, looks down, and 
we SEE traces of fingerprint powder on the toilet articles 
and bottles. He doesn't touch anything. He crosses to 
closet, opens door. A light goes on inside. He starts in.

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - BETTY'S CLOSET -- NIGHT

Killaine examines several garments, takes a sports coat 
off hanger, opens it up at lining. His looks becomes fixed 
and intent. He reacts. (What he sees is that the sewed-in 
label has been removed from the garment.) Slowly he replaces 
the coat, then takes down another garment, goes through 
the same performance. He whistles very softly between his 
teeth, stands a moment with a puzzled expression on his 
face, replaces the garment. Exits closet. Light goes out.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - PENTHOUSE - LOBBY -- NIGHT

As elevator come up, Killaine exits elevator, crosses, 
presses buzzer beside Brandon's door. Brandon opens it, 
Killaine nods to him, passes him on the way in.

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

As Killaine enters, stops, looking around.

KILLAINE
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, 
Mrs. West, Mr.  Clarendon.

He turns to Betty.

KILLAINE
Miss Mayfield. There's not much I 
can do tonight. But there is one 
thing.

He moves across to Clarendon, takes gun and handkerchief 
out of his pocket and holds it so only Clarendon can see 
it.

KILLAINE
Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen 
this before?

CLARENDON
(looking down)
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know 
much about..

KILLAINE
(sharply)
Recently, then.

CLARENDON
(slowly)
No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.

KILLAINE
Thank you.

He moves to Margo, holds gun in front of her.

KILLAINE
Mr. West?

Margo's eyes go down very slowly. She stares at the gun 
for a long moment before speaking.

MARGO
(in a choked voice)
I never saw it before.

KILLAINE
Positive?

Margo lifts her face to him and nods.

KILLAINE
Thank you.

BRANDON
Yes, I've seen it before.

Killaine reacts sharply. Killaine catches the reaction 
with the corner of his eye, but appears not to pay any 
attention. Brandon obviously does see the reaction.  
Killaine turns back to Brandon.

KILLAINE
Where?

BRANDON
On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside 
the chaise, I picked it up. Don't 
ask me why. I ought to know better.

KILLAINE
Quite sure you had no motive?

Killaine glances sidewise at Betty.

BRANDON
Could be.

KILLAINE
I rather thought so. And before 
that, had you ever seen the gun?

BRANDON
No.

Margo is seen to react with great relief which she tries 
to conceal. Killaine gives another quick sidelong look.  
Brandon has continued to watch her.

KILLAINE
(to Brandon)
It was lying where on the balcony?

BRANDON
Near his right hand. About a foot 
away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, 
one doesn't use a tape measure.

KILLAINE
We do, when we get the chance.

Killaine turns so that he faces Margo and Clarendon.

KILLAINE
I needn't keep you any longer, Mr. 
Clarendon.

CLARENDON
(standing up)
Thank you. It is rather late... 
and I'm not young anymore. Good 
night.

MARGO
What about me?

KILLAINE
Not quiet yet.

He crosses and opens door. Clarendon goes out. Killaine 
shuts door, goes to Margo.

KILLAINE
You knew Mitchell pretty well, 
didn't you, Mrs. West?

MARGO
I was in love with him... which 
shows you the quality of my brains.
(bursting out--
looking at Betty)
Why don't you ask her about the 
gun?

KILLAINE
I shall. From your knowledge of 
Mitchell, would you say he would 
be likely to commit suicide?

MARGO
Anybody could commit suicide, if 
he felt low enough. I've felt it 
myself.

KILLAINE
Then why not give Miss Mayfield 
the benefit of the doubt?

MARGO
I'd be delighted to... anytime you 
can show me the doubt. I'll wrap 
it up in tissue paper and put a 
Christmas seals on it for her.

KILLAINE
Thank you very much, Mrs. West.

Margo flounces to door, jerks it open before anybody can 
get there to hold it for her, and goes out, banging the 
door after her.

BRANDON
How about a cup of coffee?

KILLAINE
No thanks. I had some. How would 
you like to take a walk for, say, 
half and hour?

Brandon glances at Betty, then back at Killaine, Shrugs.

BRANDON
All right.

He crosses, gets hat and coat, goes to door and out.  
Killaine turns to Betty.

KILLAINE
Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.

BETTY
I don't know her.. or particularly 
want to.

KILLAINE
You probably know the type. You 
find them in hotels and resorts 
all over the world. They always 
have clothes, and money, and usually 
have had three or four husbands. 
They dress and enamel themselves 
with great care. They worry a great 
deal about those little lines at 
the corner of the eyes.. And they 
demonstrate their incompetence at 
the art of living bet getting mixed 
up with people like Larry Mitchell.
(a beat)
Tell me about yourself, Miss 
Mayfield.

BETTY
I was born in New York City. I 
grew up. And here I am.

KILLAINE
I'll have to know a little more 
than that.

BETTY
I'm sorry, that's all there is.

KILLAINE
Miss Mayfield, the humor of the 
situation escapes me. Within 24 
hours I shall know officially 
whether Mitchell was murdered.  
Privately, I'm quite sure of it 
now. It happened in your room, and 
you came to Vancouver with him.. 
At any rate, he made your hotel 
reservation.. And you arrived 
together. Here in this room he 
behaved nastily to you, and you 
said something to him which might 
be taken as a threat.  A few hours 
later he was found dead on your 
balcony. Would it be too much too 
suggest that all these circumstances 
taken together are a little 
suspicious?

Betty doesn't answer.

KILLAINE
Please answer my question.

BETTY
You didn't ask a question. You 
made a speech.

KILLAINE
That's an evasion and you know it.

BETTY
It is?

Their eyes meet in a long stare.

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - MARGO'S ROOM -- NIGHT

There is some moonlight. In the foreground, the back of a 
man seated in a chair. Door opens, Margo is silhouetted 
against corridor light. She switches light on, shuts door, 
turns, and reacts violently. Clarendon is sitting in chair 
with his cane between his knees. CAMERA PANS her over to 
Clarendon.

MARGO
(tensely)
What are you doing here?

CLARENDON
I don't think you locked your door.

MARGO
What do you want?

CLARENDON
See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss 
Mayfield left her door unlocked.  
Or if she didn't, there's a passkey 
on every floor in the linen room. 
The head porter has a passkey. The 
bell captain has a passkey. The 
hotel's full of passkeys.

MARGO
Passkey?

CLARENDON
Or--since one is a well-known and 
respected guest--one could go to 
the desk in the lobby and say "Miss 
Mayfield seems to have lost her 
room key--have you another"?  They 
always have another.

MARGO
Don't be a fool. I loved him. He 
wasn't worth it, but I loved him.

CLARENDON
And now that he's safe from all 
other women, you can go on loving 
him.

MARGO
You nasty, sardonic--

CLARENDON
Sardonic, if you will my dear.  
Bust nasty. You lied about the 
gun.

Margo reacts, shocked. Clarendon gets slowly to his feet.

CLARENDON
I'm a very observant man. You had 
something in your bag this 
afternoon, Something that causes 
you to hold it in a particular 
way. Something that made a 
particular sound when you put it 
down on the bar. You went out with 
Mitchell. None of us ever saw him 
again.

MARGO
(desperately)
That's not enough.

CLARENDON
I saw your face this evening when 
the detective showed you the gun.  
You lied. It was obvious.

MARGO
He saw my face too.

CLARENDON
So he did--but he hasn't told you 
what he saw. I have.

MARGO
They'll arrest that girl.  
Everything points to her.

CLARENDON
Convenient, isn't it?

He starts towards the door.

MARGO
One of these days, you're going to 
wake up in the middle of the night 
and find that you've cut your 
throat.

CLARENDON
How clumsy. I'd never forgive 
myself. Good night my dear.

MARGO
You could have got in that room, 
just as you got in here. How do I 
know you didn't kill Larry?

CLARENDON
With what motive?

MARGO
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. 
Why wouldn't you be nasty with 
deeds once in a while? You hated 
him--and I know why.

CLARENDON
He was very easy to hate. If you'll 
look in your mirror, when you are 
in a better temper- you'll know 
why.

Margo just stares at him.

CLARENDON
Very silly of me, isn't it? I'm 
not as well-off as I was once- and 
I'm used to my little comforts.

He exits. Margo looks after him, thunderstruck.

EXT. ROYAL HOTEL - PENTHOUSE - TERRACE -- NIGHT

Killaine is standing at wall, looking out over view. He is 
smoking. He points up with cigarette.

KILLAINE
That star up there is Alphard. 
"The lonely", they call him. I 
wonder why he's lonely? Perhaps 
he's a policeman--a celestial 
policeman?

CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Betty, who is staring at him.  
He turns slowly.

KILLAINE
Well, that's not getting us 
anywhere. You won't tell me who 
you are, or give any account of 
yourself. You won't even give me 
your address in the United States. 
Why? Unhappy marriage?

BETTY
Who told you I was married?

KILLAINE
There's the clear mark of a wedding 
ring on your finger.

She turns, walks abruptly away, then back into the living 
room. Killaine follows.

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

As Killaine enters. Betty is already inside. She sits down.

BETTY.
I want a cigarette.

KILLAINE
The room's full of cigarettes.  
But of course one would have to be 
handed to you.

He goes to her, takes out sliver case, and opens it. She 
takes one, is about to return the case to his pocket when:

BETTY
Let me see that.

He holds case out to her. There is an inlaid design on it.

BETTY
Your family coat of arms, Mr.  
Killaine?

KILLAINE
(crossly)
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.

BETTY
I'm sorry.

KILLAINE
Stop saying you're sorry. I want 
information, not regrets.

BETTY
Would you be satisfied if I said I 
shot him?

Killaine jerks the wrapped gun out of his pocket and thrusts 
it in front of her.

KILLAINE
What this?

BETTY
Yes.

KILLAINE
Where's you get it?

BETTY
A graduation present.

Killaine puts the gun back in his pocket.

KILLAINE
That's a rather inferior grade 
humor. But since you're being so 
frank, would you mind telling me 
why all the labels have been removed 
from your clothes?

Betty is jarred. She doesn't answer.

KILLAINE
An unhappy marriage hardly seems a 
sufficient reason for that.

BETTY
Why don't you arrest me and be 
done with it.

KILLAINE
I probably shall--after I've 
tortured you a little more.

SOUND OF ROOM DOOR OPENING OFF: Killaine looks towards it.  
Brandon comes in and shuts door, throws hat and coat to 
one side.

BRANDON
How are you two getting along?

KILLAINE
Delightfully. Every time Miss 
Mayfield says something, I know 
less than I did before.
(a beat)
Well, I may as well knock off for 
tonight.
(turns to Betty)
Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let 
me thank you for your cooperation.

BETTY
There's one thing I may as well 
tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. 
I tried to run away--when I found 
him out there on the balcony. There 
wasn't any plane.

BRANDON
You didn't have to tell him that.

KILLAINE
(dryly)
Why not?

He picks up his trench coat and starts to put it on.

KILLAINE
Especially as I already knew it.

He goes out. They watch him leave. As the door closes, 
Brandon turns to Betty.

BRANDON
Bad?

BETTY
Bad enough.

BRANDON
He could hardly help suspecting 
you.

BETTY
That's putting it mildly.

She walks across to French doors and stands looking out.

BETTY
(over shoulder)
What time is it?

BRANDON
(looking at watch)
Quarter after one. Why?

BETTY
There's a lot of night left to 
live through.

BRANDON
So there is. You don't want to go 
to bed. I don't want to go to bed. 
Let's go somewhere and hear some 
music--have something to drink--
something to eat--even dance.

BETTY
Dance? Tonight?

BRANDON
Let's not pretend Mitchell meant 
anything to either of us.

BETTY
Certainly not to me.

BRANDON
Just who are you, anyway?

BETTY
You, too?
(a beat)
My name is Betty Mayfield. I was 
born, and I am here. Message ends. 
That's what I told him. He didn't 
like it.

BRANDON
I'm different. I like it fine.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - LOBBY/DESK/ELEVATOR BANK -- NIGHT

Killaine is standing at the desk, holding a registration 
card in his hand. A clerk is across the desk from him.

KILLAINE
Nice writing--but no information
(he hands the card 
back to clerk)
I didn't expect any.

Elevator comes down, doors open. Betty and Brandon come 
out. Killaine turns, sees them. Brandon crosses to Killaine.

BRANDON
Miss Mayfield would like a little 
fresh air. Any objections?

Killaine shakes his head.

BRANDON
In case you want to have us 
followed.

KILLAINE
I don't.

BRANDON
Well--good night.

Killaine looks past him at Betty. Their eyes meet. Killaine 
turns away quickly. Brandon rejoins Betty and they start 
out of scene.

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - LOBBY -- NIGHT

TRACKING SHOT - BRANDON AND BETTY WALKING

Lobby is very empty. A short, thick-set MAN is trimming a 
cigar in a chain. They pass in front of him. He looks up, 
stares hard at Betty. Betty meets his glance, looks away 
quickly. CAMERA STOPS AND HOLDS ON SEATED MAN. He looks 
after them, puts away his pocket knife, lights cigar 
leisurely, stands up, goes after them.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. STREET - WATERFRONT -- NIGHT

Mooring slips on one side, below a sea wall. On the other 
side, a row of nondescript buildings, a few which have 
electric signs, one of them an old-fashioned winking 
electric sign. It is a run-down neighborhood and tough.  
Brandon's convertible enters shot, pulls over to curb in 
front of blinking sign.

CLOSER SHOT

Sign is now seen to be "CHARLIE'S" but the "R" is half 
out, dead bulbs. Car stops, Brandon and Betty get out.

EXT. SIDEWALK - CHARLIE'S BAR -- NIGHT

CLOSE SHOT

BRANDON AND BETTY ON SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF CHARLIE'S.

Betty is shivering.

BRANDON
Cold?

BETTY
Is this the best you can do?

BRANDON
At this time of night. It's not as 
bad as it looks.

A little reluctantly, she crosses sidewalk with him, they 
go into swinging double doors. As the doors open, sounds 
of very bad dance music is heard. Doors swing shut again.

CAMERA PULLS BACK AND PANS SLOWLY ACROSS THE STREET, as 
the nondescript little car with dim lights comes up to 
curb and stops some way behind Brandon's convertible. Lights 
go out, and the short, tick-set man from the lobby of the 
hotel gets out of car, walks along to Brandon's car, leans 
in, pokes a small pencil flash at the registration on the 
steering post, takes out a notebook, makes a note in it, 
puts notebook and flash away, crosses to swinging doors, 
starts in.

INT. CHARLIE'S BAR - UPSTAIRS DINE AND DANCE ROOM -- NIGHT

The decor is strictly Gas-house Gothic. There are booths 
like horse stalls, also round scarred tables and hard 
chairs. The dance band on plain wooden platform, composed 
of five old young men, plays moodily and contemptuously.  
There isn't a thing in the joint that could be damaged by 
being dropped out of a third-story window. At one table 
sits a NAVY SAILOR across from a BLOUSY GIRL. There is an 
empty glass in front of him. He sits very straight, vacant 
eyed, stupid drunk. A chunky grim-looking character in a 
dinner jacket comes by table, pauses to glance at sailor, 
makes a signal to girl, who nods. CAMERA PANS him across 
to booth in which Brandon and Betty have just sat down. 
The MAN in dinner jacket is MAGRUDER. He owns the joint.

MAGRUDER
Nice to see you, Mr. Brandon--and 
the lady. What'll you take?

BRANDON
(glancing at Betty)
Scotch?

Betty nods lifelessly; to Magruder.

BRANDON
Scotch. The kind you buy, Magruder, 
not the kind you make.

MAGDRUDER
Only the best for you, Mr.  Brandon.

He signals a waiter, goes out of shot. Band starts to play.  
Betty looks out of booth.

ANOTHER ANGLE - BRANDON'S POV - WHAT HE SEES

Three couples start to lumber around the small dance floor.  
The air is heavy with smoke. The soused sailor and blousy 
girl come dancing into foreground. Sailor is dancing with 
all the grace of a rhinoceros.

BLOWSY GIRL
What you need is a drink, big boy.

SAILOR
(suddenly pushing 
her away)
Aw, go blow your nose.

He starts back to table. Girl shrugs resignedly, goes after 
him.

BRANDON AND BETTY
She is staring horrified at this.

BETTY
Why did you bring me to such a 
place?

BRANDON
(casually)
There isn't anywhere else.

Waiter comes up and serves drinks. Brandon tastes it to 
make sure he gets what he orders, nods his head. Betty 
seizes glass almost convulsively and takes a long swallow.

BRANDON
Want to dance?

BETTY
Dance? Here?

BRANDON
Why not?

BETTY
(staring at him)
They know you here--know your name.

BRANDON
I know everybody. I don't look at 
half of life, just the nice half, 
I look at all of it.

Betty finishes off her drink, then in a reckless, half-
wild voice,

BETTY
All right, then, let's dance.

They get up out of booth and about to start dancing when 
Betty's gaze becomes fixed on something across the room.

BRANDON'S POV - WHAT HE SEES

Thick-set MAN from the lobby sitting alone at a table with 
a bottle of beer in front of him. He is staring over at 
Betty and Brandon.

BACK TO BETTY AND BRANDON

BETTY
That man over there. He was in the 
hotel lobby.

BRANDON
(he looks across)
I didn't notice him.

BETTY
We walked right passed him. He's 
following us.

BRANDON
Killaine's not that sort of guy.  
He said no--he meant no.

BETTY
Then he's got to be a detective.

BRANDON
Couldn't be.

BETTY
Then he's--
(she breaks off, 
stares rigidly)

Brandon looks at her curiously, not getting it. Betty 
swallows and then gets her voice.

BETTY
Take me out of here, please.  Right 
away.
(Brandon just keeps 
looking at her.)
If you don't I'll go alone.

Brandon reaches for her coat, puts it around her, throws 
some money on the table. They start across room. Brandon 
deliberately steers past the thick-set man, who is pouring 
himself a glass of beer. He doesn't even look up. Brandon 
and Betty reach the top of the stairs. Brandon looks back.

BRANDON
Quite sure you saw him in the hotel 
lobby?

BETTY
Absolutely sure.

BRANDON
(his eyes narrow a 
little)
We'll find out.

He turns, takes Betty's arm, they start down the stairs, 
CAMERA PANS OVER TO MAN. He now looking after them with 
half smile on his face. He lifts his glass of beer in 
salute, drinks it down, stands up.

FOOT OF STAIRS JUST INSIDE SWINGING DOORS

It is pretty dark. It is not a solid stairway, there is a 
space behind it. Brandon notes this.

BRANDON
You go out and get in the car.

Betty hesitates, then starts out. Brandon looks back 
upstairs. SOUND OF DESCENDING STEPS OVER SHOT. Brandon 
goes quickly around stairway almost out of sight. Thick-
set man comes down the stairs. He is now trimming another 
cigar. As he reaches the bottom of stairs, he stops, takes 
out a match, and is about to strike it then Brandon steps 
out.  The man looks at him unemotionally, cigar and match 
in midair.

BRANDON
The light's bad in here, but I 
seem to remember the face. What 
was the name?

Man smiles, doesn't answer.

BRANDON
All right, let's see the buzzer.

MAN
What's a buzzer?

BRANDON
So you're not a cop.

MAN
Me a cop? What made you think that, 
Mr. Brandon?

BRANDON
Who told you my name?

MAN
I've got good ears.

Brandon steps up close to him, grabs the lapels of his 
coat, and twists a little.

BRANDON
(tightly)
How are your teeth getting along?

MAN
(smiling)
The new ones are fine. The last 
set I had gave me all kinds of 
trouble.

He looks down at Brandon's hand, holding the lapels of his 
coat.

MAN
What's this in favor of?

BRANDON
I don't like to be tailed. The 
lady I'm with doesn't like to be 
stared at. To put the matter in a 
couple of nutshells, I don't like 
you.

Still smiling, the man brings his knee up hard. Brandon 
reels away from him, groaning, doubles up against the wall.

MAN
You wanna get tough, Mr. Brandon, 
you gotta know the technique.  
Next time, turn a little sideways, 
get your hip in the way. See what 
I mean? Good night.

He goes through the double doors. CAMERA STAYS ON BRANDON.  
He straightens up slowly, gets out handkerchief, mops his 
forehead. He has been hurt pretty badly. After a while, he 
stiffens himself by main force, walks to door, pushes it 
open, starts out.

EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

He stands, breathing hard, looking off.

BRANDON'S POV - WHAT HE SEES

Thick-set man is getting into his car. He starts it up, 
turns the light on, turns and goes out of shot.

BACK TO BRANDON

He crosses sidewalk slowly to his convertible. Betty is 
waiting in it. Without a word, Brandon goes around, gets 
in behind the wheel. He sits there with his hands on the 
wheel, taking deep breaths.

BETTY
(urgently)
Who is he?

Brandon turns his head slowly to look at her. He speaks a 
little quickly, still in pain.

BRANDON
He's a fellow with a very hard 
knee, and he knows how to use it.

BETTY
You don't know who he is?

BRANDON
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't 
have kneed me.

BETTY
(slowly)
He was following us--but he's not 
a policeman.

BRANDON
Us?

BETTY
All right--following me.

BRANDON
Why?

BETTY
No matter. There's nothing I can 
do about it.

BRANDON
Anything I can do about it?

BETTY
Take me home--and forget you ever 
saw me. That's a silly remark isn't 
it?

BRANDON
Try not talking.

He puts an arm around her and pulls her close to him as if 
to kiss her.

BRANDON
It still doesn't matter if I kiss 
you?

BETTY
Nothing matters.

BRANDON
No use waiting, then.

He kisses her on the mouth, hard. She doesn't resist and 
she doesn't respond. He pulls his head away.

BRANDON
That's the second round I've lost 
tonight.
(he moves and winces)
That fellow hurt me.

BETTY
So have I.

BRANDON
From you, I like it.

He starts the car. It goes off down the street.

FADE IN:

INT. HOTEL - LOBBY -- DAY

EXTREME WIDE SHOT

Showing desk, elevator bank, guests reading morning papers 
in chairs. In background the dining room entrance through 
which can be seen part of the dining room, with waiters 
moving back and forth etc. It is breakfast time. Betty 
appears in dining room entrance, coming out.

CLOSE SHOT - BETTY

CAMERA PANS with her as she moves across lobby to desk.  
Room clerk is checking in several new arrivals. Luggage, 
bellboys, etc. Betty moves along the desk to far end, stands 
waiting. Hotel manager comes up to her. He pretends not to 
know her.

MANAGER
Good morning. Can I do something 
for you?

BETTY
I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell 
here?

MANAGER
I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield.
(slight pause)
Purely as a matter of routine, I 
want to ask the name of your bank.

BETTY
Bank?

MANAGER
(very smoothly)
Merely for our records, Miss 
Mayfield. It's usual for the guests 
who come here for the first time.

BETTY
(opening her bag)
I'm carrying quite a large sum in 
Travelers checks. How much of a 
deposit would you like?

CAMPBELL
I wouldn't dream if questioning 
your credit. Purely a matter of 
routine, for the hotel records.  
Just the name of your bank--

He breaks off, glances over to one side.

CLOSE REVERSE SHOT - BETTY

She notices the glance and turns her head, looks off in 
the same direction, reacts, looks back at Campbell.

BETTY
(sharply)
The Hotel records, Mr. Campbell?

TWO SHOT - CAMPBELL AND BETTY

CAMPBELL
(brightly)
I'm afraid I've been clumsy.  Please 
overlook it, Miss Mayfield.

With a quick nod Betty turns away. CAMERA PANS her over to 
extreme end of desk. Killaine stands there idly, with an 
elbow on the desk. Betty comes up to him. She is angry.

BETTY
Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I'm 
sorry I can't give you the name of 
my bank--because I have no bank at 
the moment.
(pause)
That was a crude trick.

KILLAINE
They're all crude, when they don't 
work. Had breakfast?

She nods.

KILLAINE
Care for a stroll outside?  
Beautiful morning. The air is like 
wine, the sky is a deep blue.

BETTY
(contemptuously)
Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.

KILLAINE
You must come from pretty far South.

She bites her lips.

KILLAINE
FLorida?

BETTY
I've never been to Florida.

Killaine smiles and moves away from desk, and she falls in 
beside him.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BRANDON'S OFFICE BUILDING - DOOR -- DAY

CLOSE-UP - AN OFFICE DOOR

Metal lettering on it reads CLARK BRANDON ENTERPRISES.  
Below that to one side ENTER.

INT. BRANDON'S OFFICE BUILDING - RECEPTION ROOM -- DAY

A middle-aged SECRETARY is at a desk. a MAN sitting over 
to one side, reading a newspaper. He is short, thick-set, 
wears heavy glasses. These are phony glasses--they just 
look heavy--there is a clear spot in the middle. DOOR OPENS 
OFF. Brandon enters shot, goes across to desk.

SECRETARY
Good morning, Mr. Brandon.

BRANDON
Morning. Any calls?

SECRETARY
Mr. Reed would like you to call 
him.

BRANDON
All right. Get him.

SECRETARY
(looking off)
And there's a Mr. Goble to see 
you. Says his business is personal.

BRANDON
Who's Goble?

CAMERA PANS OVER TO MAN with glasses. He puts his newspaper 
away, stands up, crosses to Brandon, CAMERA PANNING HIM 
BACK.

MAN
I'm Goble.

Brandon looks at him. Nothing in his face shows recognition.

GOBLE
I'd like a few words with you, in 
private.

BRANDON
I'm not interested in blind dates.

Goble takes his glasses off, puts then away, and stares at 
Brandon, who reacts just enough to show he has recognized 
Goble. During this, secretary has dialed

SECRETARY
(into phone)
Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.
(pause)
Very well. Have him call. Mr.  
Brandon is in his office now.
(she hangs up)
Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon.

BRANDON
(to Goble)
This way.

He crosses to door, opens it, goes in, leaving Goble to 
follow.

INT. BRANDON'S OFFICE - PRIVATE OFFICE -- DAY

Brandon round desk, takes off hat, stands looking down at 
some letters on his desk. DOOR CLOSES BEHIND Goble, who 
has entered. Goble crosses calmly to chair, sits down. 
Brandon gets cigarette out and lights it with desk lighter, 
without offering Goble one, and blows a little smoke.

BRANDON
All right. Talk it up.

Goble gets a card out of his wallet, hands it across.

BRANDON
(reading)
"Martin Goble. Insurance Adjuster."

He drops card on desk, smiles.

BRANDON
Nice friendly approach you've got. 
Goble. I could hardly walk when I 
got out of bed this morning.

GOBLE
You asked for it.

BRANDON
I'm still asking. What do you want?

GOBLE
I'm not sure I want anything from 
you. You might want something from 
me.

BRANDON
Name it.

GOBLE
Information--protection--you might 
even want to hire me to go home 
and listen to the radio.  That's 
the funny part of my business--
once in a while, I get hired not 
to work.
(pause)
Nice girl you were with last night. 
Known her long?

Brandon picks the card off the desk, tosses it into waste 
paper basket.

BRANDON
Private eye?

GOBLE
You guessed it. The card's phony.  
I got plenty of 'em. Different 
names, different jobs. I work out 
of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do 
anything. All it takes is the 
folding.

BRANDON
What are your rates?

GOBLE
$40 a day and expenses. Expenses 
run pretty high on a case like 
this. I'm a long way from home. I 
don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd 
need about $500 for a retainer.

BRANDON
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?

GOBLE
Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were 
with last night. You haven't hired 
me yet. Mr. Brandon.

Brandon moves quickly around the desk, grabs Goble, and 
jerks him to his feet.

BRANDON
(with cold savagery)
That's a nice hard knee you've 
got, Goble. How'd you like to trade 
it for a broken neck?

GOBLE
(calmly)
Quit trying to scare me, Mr.  
Brandon, I'm neurotic.

BRANDON
I don't know whether to knock your 
teeth down your throat--or call 
the police--or just give you twenty 
bucks to go out and buy yourself a 
clean nose.

Brandon hurls him away. Goble staggers back, without losing 
his balance. He smiles. Brandon stares back at him savagely 
for a moment, then goes back around his desk and sits down.

GOBLE
You hurt my feelings. I ought to 
raise the price to be a thousand.

BRANDON
If I call the police, your price 
will go down to a minus sign.

GOBLE
Bluff. You've waited too long.

BRANDON
For five hundred, what do I get?

GOBLE
I go home and paint the kitchen.

BRANDON
For two hundred?

GOBLE
I stick around and wait for the 
five hundred.

BRANDON
You mentioned information.

GOBLE
Sorry. Another client paid for 
that. You can hire me not to use 
it.

BRANDON
A thousand.

GOBLE
(hesitates--then)
Got it on you?

BRANDON
Got the information on you?

GOBLE
Get it in half an hour.

Brandon takes out his wallet, takes some bills out of it, 
throws then across the desk.

BRANDON
There's two hundred. I'll meet you 
in an hour--where we met last night

GOBLE
Why not here?

BRANDON
I don't like your perfume in my 
office. Make it somewhere else if 
you don't like Charlie's.

GOBLE
Charlie's suits me fine. I don't 
scare.

He reaches for the money, stands up and puts it in his 
pocket.

GOBLE
You pay the check, you pick the 
joint. See you.

He exits scene.

WIPE TO:

EXT. HOTEL - FOOT OF THE GARDENS/WALL -- DAY

Betty and Killaine are learning on a wall, looking out 
over Puget Sound.

KILLAINE
Down below's Stanley Park. On the 
other side of the trees, there's a 
beach. You can see it.
(points over to 
left)
Steveston's over there. Coast Guard 
station.
(points to right)
There's the Yacht Club, and beyond 
it, the docks. The over on the 
other side of the inlet, there's 
Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 
feet high. There's a restaurant on 
top of it. Very nice restaurant.
(he turns to Betty)
I'm sorry we couldn't have met in 
pleasanter circumstances, Miss 
Mayfield.

BETTY
We wouldn't have met at all.

KILLAINE
True. I was a bit irritable last 
night. I apologize.

BETTY
You were a galahad, compared to 
some cops I've known.

KILLAINE
(pouncing--but very 
quietly)
You've had dealings with the police 
before?

BETTY
Who hasn't--one way or another?

KILLAINE
But not in the investigation of a 
major crime, I hope.

BETTY
Is it a crime?

KILLAINE
We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell 
was murdered. There are a lot of 
reasons.
(pause)
Was he very drunk when you last 
saw him?

BETTY
You were there when I last saw 
him.

KILLAINE
I'd like to believe that. It's not 
too easy.

Betty says nothing. Killaine looks away again.

KILLAINE
I've been talking to the Immigration 
Inspector who passed you across 
the border. He was a little 
suspicious of you.  Mayfield isn't 
really your name, is it?

Betty looks straight ahead, doesn't answer.

KILLAINE
I'll find out, you know. Perhaps 
not today--perhaps not tomorrow.  
But in the end, I'll find out.

BETTY
The police always do, don't they?

KILLAINE
You've has an experience that you 
don't want to talk about. An unhappy 
marriage, for example.

Betty turns away quickly.

KILLAINE
I wouldn't make you talk about it. 
My job is the death of Marry 
Mitchell.  Why can't you give me 
your confidence?

BETTY
You--or the Vancouver Police 
Department?

KILLAINE
We try to be decent.

BETTY
You're a police officer. A very 
nice one--but you have a job to 
do. I'm a girl who's in a jam, and 
it's your job to keep me there. 
Don't go considerate on me. I might 
start to bawl.

Their eyes meet in a long look.

KILLAINE
You won't tell me who you are?  
You won't even give me a chance to 
help you?

BETTY
Nobody can help me. You, least of 
all.

KILLAINE
(suddenly)
If I understand what you meant by 
that.

BETTY
You understand perfectly.

KILLAINE
Then there isn't much I can do, is 
there?

BETTY
There isn't anything you can do.

He moves towards her, then turns abruptly and goes.

WIPE TO:

INT. CHARLIE'S PLACE -- DAY

Chairs are piled up on the tables. A MAN with a mop is 
going over the floor. STEPS ARE HEARD. Goble, the private 
eye comes into the SHOT slowly. His eyes are very wary. He 
has a hand in his pocket.

GOBLE
I came here to see Mr. Brandon.

MAN WITH MOP
Who?

GOBLE
Brandon. I was to meet him here.

MAN WITH MOP
Okay. Ask the boss.

He jerks his thumb backwards, and Goble moves off in that 
direction.

INT. CHARLIE'S PLACE - DOOR OPENING/SMALL DARK HALL -- DAY

CAMERA FOLLOWS GOBLE

Though open door. He stands a moment, looking along the 
hallway, listening. There is no sound at all. He reaches a 
door CAMERA PANS AROUND to show small plate on the door 
with the word MANAGER. Goble listens again, takes the gun 
out of his pocket, looks at it, puts it back, keeping his 
hand on it, opens the door, and stars in.

INT. CHARLIE'S PLACE - MANAGER'S OFFICE -- DAY

It is what you would expect. Magruder is at a desk, doing 
some bookkeeping work. He looks up indifferently as Goble 
ENTERS.

GOBLE
I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.

MAGRUDER
The joint's not open, Mac.  Who's 
Brandon?

Goble comes up to the desk.

GOBLE
I have an appointment with him, 
right here, right now.

MAGRUDER
Go live in a tent.

GOBLE
It'll be a tough dollar when guys 
like you learn the alphabet.

MAGRUDER
(grinning)
Talk English.  How do I know you're 
you?

Goble reaches a hand into his pocket, throws a card on the 
desk.  Magruder picks it up, reads it.

MAGRUDER
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He 
might have left something for you.  
What would it look like?

GOBLE
One of those nice long manila 
envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat-
not too thin.

MAGRUDER
What do I get for it?

GOBLE
You get it's brother.

MAGRUDER
Sounds like a fair swap.  Let's 
take a look.

He jerks open the drawer of his desk.  Gobble stiffens, 
his hand on the gun.  Magruder takes out a long sealed 
envelope, throws it on the desk.

MAGRUDER
I need a receipt.  Sign your name 
across the flap.

GOBLE
Open it and count it.

MAGRUDER
When you sign for it, you count 
it.  It's your dough.

He picks up a desk pen, holds it out.  Goble hesitates, 
then takes his right hand holding the gun out of his pocket, 
lays the gun down on the desk beside the envelope.  He 
takes the pen, leans down to write.  At that instant, 
Magruder lunges up swiftly, grabs Goble's right wrist with 
his left hand and jerks him forward hard.  Goble tries to 
reach the gun with his left hand.  Magruder grabs an old-
fashioned round ebony ruler up off the desk and smacks 
Goble's hard on the head with it twice.  Goble sprawls 
across the desk, limp.  Magruder takes the gun, puts it in 
his pocket, picks up the envelope, tears it open, and shakes 
out the money, counts it.

MAGRUDER
Eight hundred bucks.  Ice cream 
for dinner.

Magruder picks the gun up, balances it on his hand.

MOVE IN ON THE GUN

It is a .32 caliber revolver, with part of the barrel sawed 
off to make it a belly gun.  It has no front sight.

Magruder stares down at it.  PULL AWAY as he turns, pulls 
open desk drawer, puts gun in it, shuts drawer.  He rounds 
the desk, reaches inside Goble's pocket, pulls out a thick 
manila envelope, stands looking down at it, speculating, 
tries the flap to see if it will come loose.

MOVE IN TO SHOW THERE IS NO WRITING ON THE ENVELOPE

He picks up the envelope which contained money.  It is 
also manila and about the same size.  With a quick decision, 
Magruder tears open GOBLE'S ENVELOPE, draws out a sheaf of 
blank paper.  Magruder whistles lightly between his teeth, 
turns his head to state at Goble who is still limp, sprawled 
across the desk.

MAGRUDER
(softly)
You had it coming, didn't you, 
baby?
(reaches across, 
shakes Goble's 
shoulders)
Come on.  You're not that sick.

Goble does not respond.  Magruder pulls his head and 
shoulder up on the desk.  The head sags to one side.  
Magruder presses a thumb against one of Goble's eyeballs.  
No reaction.  Magruder bends close, stares, and is suddenly 
stiff with fear.

MAGRUDER
(hoarsely)
Don't tell me you had a glass head, 
baby.  Oh no--not in your business.  
How could you live so long?

He lets go of Goble who sways sideways in the chair, his 
head hanging like that of a broken doll.  As Magruder stares 
down at him, with very much the sort of frozen horror as 
we saw on Betty's face when she found Mitchell's body on 
the balcony.

WIPE TO:

INT. VANCOUVER POLICE HEADQUARTERS -  KILLAINE'S OFFICE -- 
DAY

Small bare room, empty.  Door opens.  Sergeant Gore users 
Margo in through a side door.

GORE
Sit down, Mrs. West.  Inspector 
Killaine will be along in a minute.

MARGO
Thank you.

Gore sits down in a hard wooden chair by Killaine's desk.  
She is nervous, lights a cigarette, looks at her watch, 
gets up suddenly as if to leave before Killaine gets back, 
then shrugs and sits down again, Door opens and Killaine 
enters, glances at Margo, goes behind his desk, sits down 
with his hat on, presses dictagraph key.

KILLAINE
(into dictagraph)
Killaine here.  I want a radio 
contact to work with Handley.  A 
motorcycle officer will do.

VOICE FROM DICTAGRAPH
Right away, Inspector.

Killaine disconnects, turns to face Margo, removing his 
hat.

KILLAINE
Remember that time, didn't I?  
Good morning Mrs. West.  Does your 
visit here mean you've changed 
your mind?

MARGO
(startled)
How did you know?
(Killaine smiles 
slightly, doesn't 
answer)
Clarendon.
(Killaine still 
doesn't answer)
You cops never tell anybody 
anything, do you.

KILLAINE
Other people always know so much 
more than we know--so much more 
than they're willing to tell us.

MARGO
It was Clarendon.  He knew I had 
the gun in my bag.

Killaine just stares

MARGO
You couldn't possible have traced 
it this soon--not possibly.

KILLAINE
(dryly)
Of course not.  Thanks for telling 
me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.

MARGO
I am a fool.

KILLAINE
That depends upon your motive.  
You were in love with Mitchell, 
weren't you?

MARGO
Yes--and he's already becoming 
vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I 
was furiously jealous.  Jealous of 
what?  I out that gun in my bag 
deliberately.  Who was I going to 
kill with it?  A girl I didn't 
even know?  A man I knew to be a 
thief and a forger?  A half-man?  
A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous.  
Love!  What a comedy!

KILLAINE
You didn't play it for laughs last 
night.

MARGO
Did you ever have a serious 
operation?

KILLAINE
Mortar shells are not funny, either.

MARGO
At first, it doesn't hurt at all.  
That's shock.  Then it hurts 
terribly--you wouldn't believe 
such pain could exist--and six 
months later you can't remember 
what pain felt like.
(pause)
It hasn't taken six months this 
time.  It hasn't even taken twenty-
four hours.  Is that a beastly 
thing to say?

KILLAINE
Not if it clears the air.

MARGO
It does.  May I go now?
(she stands up)

KILLAINE
I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's 
financial position--

MARGO
I don't understand.

KILLAINE
Perhaps a rich widow would have 
solved all his problems.

MARGO
Now, you're being beastly.

KILLAINE
Sure.  You didn't come here in 
person just to tell me about the 
gun.  You wanted me to be looking 
across the desk at you while you 
talked about Mitchell.
(he pauses; Margo 
nods--admiration 
in her eyes)
If I believe you, it would be 
psychologically impossible for you 
to have killed him last night.

MARGO
And if you didn't believe me?

KILLAINE
You would still have planted 
information that Clarendon knew 
about the gun--and not as an 
accusation, but in the process of 
defending yourself by making a 
confession.  Very neat.  Good 
morning, Mrs. West.

Her expression changes.  She gives him an icy stare, and 
goes out quickly.  Dictagraph BUZZES.  He depressed key.

KILLAINE
(into speaker)
Killaine here.

SUPT. MCKECHNIE'S VOICE (ON DICTAGRAPH)
Come into my office, please, 
Killaine.

KILLAINE
(into speaker)
Right away, sir.

He releases the key, starts out

INT. VANCOUVER POLICE HEADQUARTERS - CORRIDOR -- DAY

As Killaine comes out of his office, walks along briskly, 
comes to a door, stops.

CLOSE SHOT OF DOOR

It is lettered SUPERINTENDENT J. McKECHNIE.

Killaine KNOCKS, then starts in without waiting for an 
answer.

INT. VANCOUVER POLICE HEADQUARTERS - MCKECHNIE'S OFFICE -- 
DAY

McKechnie is at his desk.  He is a military-looking Scotch-
Canadian, with a white mustache.  Beside the desk sits an 
elderly, prim-looking man in a dark suit with a black tie.  
Killaine comes up to desk.

MCKECHNIE
Killaine, this is Mr. Mitchell, 
Senior.  Young Mitchell's father.  
He just flew in from Toronto.

KILLAINE
(to Mitchell)
How do you do, sir.

Mitchell nods.

MCKECHNIE
I've explained the situation to 
Mr. Mitchell up to a point.  Now 
about this Mayfield girl?

KILLAINE
She's a suspect, naturally.  But 
not the only one.

MCKECHNIE
(harshly)
She's the only one who had a dead 
man in her room.  The only one who 
won't give an account of herself.  
The only one who tried to run away.  
And the only one, so far, I've 
been told, who went to such lengths 
to disguise her identity that she 
even removed the labels from her 
clothes.  What more do you want?

MITCHELL, SR.
She should have been arrested last 
night.

MCKECHNIE
That's as may be.
(to Killaine)
We've ample grounds to detain her 
for questioning.  You can't deny 
that, surely.

KILLAINE
No.

MCKECHNIE
I hear she's a very pretty girl.

KILLAINE
Which forces me to arrest her 
against my better judgment.

MCKECHNIE
Aye.  You have a point there.

MITCHELL, SR.
If so, I must say that it escapes 
my attention.  It is my son who 
has been murdered.  He was not 
always a good son--but he was my 
son.  I want his murderer punished.  
The girl's obviously a criminal of 
some sort.  Otherwise, she'd give 
an account of herself.  Arrest 
her, and you'll find out soon 
enough.

MCKECHNIE
(eyeing Killaine)
I think he's right.

KILLAINE
(standing up)
Am I to interpret that as an order 
to arrest Miss Mayfield?

MCKECHNIE
When I give an order, you'll not 
need it interpreted.
(glances up at clock 
on wall)
You have an hour to make your mind 
up.
(he turns to 
Mitchell, Sr.)
Well, are ye satisfied, Mr. 
Mitchell? 

MITCHELL, SR.
I'll be satisfied when my son's 
murderer is convicted and hanged.
(pause--his 
expression softens 
a little)
You've given this young man a very 
difficult choice.

MCKECHNIE
Aye.  That was the point you said 
you didn't get.
(he turns back to 
Killaine)
That's all.
(makes a gesture of 
dismissal)

KILLAINE
Very good, sir.

He turns.  We PAN HIM TO THE DOOR, he starts out.

INT. VANCOUVER POLICE HEADQUARTERS - CORRIDOR -- DAY

Killaine comes from Mckechnie's office.  Starts back to 
towards his own office.

Another plain clothes cop, DRISCOLL, is walking towards 
Killaine.  They meet just outside Killaine's office.  
Driscoll is a tall, solemn-looking Irishman.

DRISCOLL
May I have a moment, Inspector?

Killaine stops.

DRISCOLL
The Harbor police have just picked 
up a dead man out of the water.

KILLAINE
Floater?

DRISCOLL
Not a floater.  Only just dead.

KILLAINE
(starting to turn 
away)
You're the waterfront specialist.  
Find out about it.  I've got a 
murder to investigate.

DRISCOLL
You have two murders to investigate.  
This man's head was beaten in.  
And there's nothing in his pockets.

KILLAINE
Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him 
too hard.

DRISCOLL
(annoyed with his 
manner)
I've been on the waterfront detail 
for twelve years.  This man hadn't 
been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed 
last night.  He was killed today.  
In broad daylight.  That's no drunk-
rolling job.

KILLAINE
(starting to turn 
away again)
Let me know when you've identified 
him

Driscoll gives him a somber look and starts to leave.

KILLAINE
(calling after him)
And don't get too logical, Driscoll.  
In police business it doesn't work.  
I wish it did.  But it doesn't

DRISCOLL
(looking back)
I'm an Irishman, sir.  An Irishman 
is always logical.

Killaine frowns, then starts into his own little office.

EXT. PARLIAMENT BUILDING - SIDEWALK -- DAY

CLOSE SHOT -- A PORTION OF A TALL, SPEAR TOPPED IRON RAILING 
ALONG THE SIDEWALK

A MAN in a business suit is leaning against it, He is a 
plain-clothes dick by the name of HANDLEY.  Other PEOPLE 
are standing near him, looking through the railing, as if 
waiting for something to happen.  Handley is looking in 
the other direction, along the sidewalk.  In the background, 
SOME TRAFFIC NOISE, and far off, BLAST OF A TUG WHISTLE.  
Handley gets a cigarette out and lights it, with his eyes 
still looking off to the side.

CAMERA PANS SLOWLY ALONG THE RAILING, showing people 
standing in groups looking through.  CAMERA PICKS UP BETTY 
AMONG THEM.  Near at hand there is a SHARP WHISTLE BLAST, 
and immediately snare drums are HEARD, first in spaced 
tap, then going into a tattoo.

EXT. VANCOUVER - PARLIAMENT BUILDINGS -- DAY

LONG SHOT -- GRAVELED OR PAVED SPACE IN FRONT OF MILITARY 
OFFICIAL-LOOKING BUILDING

Built of stone, with broad steps.  The Union Jack flies 
from a flagpole.  On the space in front of the building, 
two small groups of soldiers is in battle-dress, and the 
band, which marches it, is a bugle and drum band, also in 
battle-dress.  The other group is in the dress uniform of 
the Seaforth Highlanders, with kilts, Glengarry's, etc., 
and their band is a piper's band, in kilts.  What is taking 
place is a guard mount.  The old guard is stood at attention 
and inspected by the outgoing officer of the day; and during 
this inspection the drums and bugle band march up and down 
in front of them, playing.  The inspection over, the old 
guard will be formed into a marching column, the drum and 
bugle band will take position ahead of them, and the whole 
outfit will march across the parade ground and back again 
while the new guard stands at attention, its band silent.  
The old guard will then be halted, and faced towards the 
new guard, and will present arms.  Then it will march off 
behind its band, while the kiltie guard is called to 
attention and presents arms.  The outgoing and incoming 
officers of the day will salute each other.  As the old 
guard marches off, their band will stop playing, and the 
pipers will march and start playing the bagpipes.  This 
will continue while the new guard is inspected.  The new 
guard will be marched will be marched off behind the pipes, 
and the ceremony is over.  This is the background of the 
following scenes, and is going on all the time.  Whatever 
portion of it is to be shown in immaterial, but the sound 
of it will be heard always, louder, not so loud, not loud 
at all, according to what is going on and how far off the 
bands are.

Betty is staring through the railing as the drum and bugle 
band goes into its tattoo and starts marching.  A moment 
later, the bugles join in.

CUT TO:

CLOSE-UP OF HANDLEY

He is looking off in the other direction, makes a signal.

WHAT HE SEES

A motorcycle officer standing beside the curb, bears his 
motorcycle which has a side-car.

CLOSE SHOT -- RADIO DISPATCHER IN COMMUNICATIONS DIVISION 
OF POLICE HEADQUARTERS

DISPATCHER
(into mike)
Go ahead, three-eight-six.

VOICE FROM LOUDSPEAKER
Party I am detailed to observe is 
watching guard mount in front of 
Parliament Buildings.  Sergeant 
Handley is standing by.

(NOTE: There is no Parliament Buildings in Vancouver.  
They are in Victoria, so some substitute must be found.)

DISPATCHER
(into mike)
Message received.  Stand by.  One-
two-five.

He scribbles something on a pad, tears off and holds out 
behind him without looking.  A uniformed POLICE OFFICER 
takes it.

CLOSE SHOT OF BETTY -- WATCHING THROUGH RAILING

WHAT SHE SEES -- A PORTION OF GUARD MOUNT THROUGH RAILING

CLOSE SHOT OF HANDLEY

Standing by railing, watching Betty.  DRUM AND BUGLE MUSIC 
OVER SCENE.

EXT. PARLIAMENT BUILDING - STREET -- DAY

LONG SHOT

A crowd against railing, Motorcycle Officer in foreground.  
A CAR ENTERS SHOT, stops behind motorcycle.

CLOSE SHOT -- CAR

Killaine gets out, crosses to Motorcycle Officer, who 
salutes him, then points out a scene.

KILLAINE
I'll take over now.  Wait for 
Handley.

He starts walking CAMERA WITH HIM, comes up with Handley, 
leans against the railing beside him.

KILLAINE
I'm relieving you, Handley.  Carry 
on with Gore at the hotel.

Handley gives Killaine a curious look.

HANDLEY
Very good, sir.

He goes out of shot.  Killaine watches him, then moves 
along the railings (the guard mount ceremony is continuing 
all this time), comes up beside Betty.

KILLAINE
This isn't a very good place to 
talk.

BETTY
I don't want to talk.

KILLAINE
I've come here to arrest you for 
murder.

DRUM AND BUGLE MUSIC IN BACKGROUND STOPS.

VOICE OF COMMAND
(over scene -- very 
sharp and military)
Guard HALT!

A SOUND OF STAMPING FEET, THEN SILENCE.

VOICE OF COMMAND
Right TURN!

A SOUND OF FEET, A STAMP, A SLAPPING OF HANDS AGAINST RIFLE 
SLINGS as guard brings its arms to order.  Betty turns her 
head to look at Killaine.

BETTY
I expected nothing else.

KILLAINE
I might be able to save you.  If I 
knew enough.

BETTY
You wouldn't even try
(Killaine reacts, 
hurt)
There must be some copper in you, 
or you wouldn't be an inspector.

KILLAINE
There must be-- but when I'm with 
you I can't find it.

VOICE OF COMMAND
(over scene)
Guard, Present ARMS!

APPROPRIATE SOUNDS ARE HEARD, THEN A ROLL STARTS ON THE 
TAP DRUMS.

KILLAINE
(turning and looking 
through railing)
Everybody loves a guard mount--
except the guard.
(looks back)
My boss gave me an hour to make up 
my mind.  The time's almost up.

For the first time in the scene, Betty turns and faces 
him.

KILLAINE
I'm about to be very silly.  A man 
passes a girl on the street--a 
very lovely girl--his eyes meet 
her eyes, and something reaches 
out and takes hold of his heart--
and then she goes on and is lost 
in the crowd--and he says to 
himself, "There goes my lost love"--
and it's true--if he never sees 
her again, it's still true.  Of 
course, after a while, he forgets--
or almost forgets--because after a 
while we forget almost everything.
(Betty is silent, 
staring at him)
But this man is a copper.  He gets 
orders--routine orders--to go to a 
place and investigate a murder--
and everything points to a certain 
girl.

BETTY
Points very straight to her.

KILLAINE
He looks at the girl, looks into 
her eyes--

BETTY
What does he see?

KILLAINE
Palm trees against a sunset--waves 
breaking on a coral reef--the Taj 
Mahal by moonlight--roses in an 
English garden, just after a shower--
(he grins wryly)
Clich s, one and all--but good 
ones, with a lot of mileage left 
in them--there's one thing he does 
not see--murder--and murder was 
what he was sent to find.  Pretty 
ridiculous, isn't it? 

BETTY
Very ridiculous.

KILLAINE
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough 
to tell you about it--and not be 
sorry.

BETTY
What do your friends call you?--
The ones that know you well?--and 
like you very much?

KILLAINE
They call me Jeff.

BETTY
Jeff.  Shall we go now, Jeff, and 
get it over with?

KILLAINE
Not quiet yet.
(pause)
We know who the gun belonged to.  
Margo West.  She told us this 
morning.
(pause)
It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell 
took it away from her.  He had a 
habit of going through her bag.

BETTY
Looking for peanuts, I suppose.

KILLAINE
So Mitchell had handled it.  
Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.
(he glances at her)
There's no indication you handled 
it.

BETTY
I always wear gloves when I shoot 
people.  A bad joke--but better 
than tears.

KILLAINE
(glancing at his 
watch again)
Time's up.  I'm off the case.
(he takes a deep 
breath)

BETTY
They'll only find someone else--
who won't be so kind.

KILLAINE
That's something I can't spare 
you.  But I won't do it myself.

BETTY
Because you think your in love 
with me?

KILLAINE
I'm enough of a copper to do my 
duty.  My boss made it tough for 
me.  If I don't arrest you, I've 
gone soft.  If I do, it's to save 
my face.  I don't play those rules.

He breaks off.  PIPE MUSIC SOUNDS OVER SCENE.  Killaine 
raises his voice.

KILLAINE
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.

BETTY
To do what?

KILLAINE
I can't answer that.

BETTY
What will they do to you?

KILLAINE
That's they're business.  Can I 
drop you somewhere?

BETTY
You're still a police officer, 
Jeff.
(pause)
I saw you send those two men away.  
I know they were watching me.

Killaine stares at her silently.

BETTY
What are you going to do--toss 
your job into Puget Sound?  Because 
I make you think of magnolias?  I 
thought policeman was something 
like a soldier.  That his duty 
came first.  However much he might 
happen hate it.

KILLAINE
(steadily)
I've been a soldier too.  There is 
a difference.  A policeman, like a 
judge, has a right to disqualify 
himself on proper grounds.

BETTY
What proper grounds?
(pause, Killaine 
doesn't answer)
You can't be in love with me.  You 
hardly know me.  I'm not in love 
with you.

KILLAINE
I know that.

BETTY
But even if you were in love with 
me.

KILLAINE
(almost rudely)
There's an empty taxi across the 
street.  If you're so anxious, 
take it.  He'll know the way to 
the police headquarters.

BETTY
You do things the hard way, don't 
you?

KILLAINE
Sometimes.

BETTY
Not sometimes.  Always.  Just 
because it is the hard way.  You're 
that kind of man, Jeff.

KILLAINE
Goodbye, Betty.

Betty doesn't answer.  She shakes her head slightly, stands 
with a little smile on her face.  He turns, goes quickly 
out of scene.  The guard mount ceremony ends.  The crowd 
begins to break up.  Betty glances across the street, then 
starts out.

CLOSE SHOT -- AN EMPTY TAXICAB, THE FLAG UP

The driver is parked by the curb.  He has been watching 
the guard mount and is ow waiting for a fare.  He sees 
one, gets quickly out of the cab, opens the door as Betty 
COMES INTO SHOT.  She gets into the cab.

CAB DRIVER
Where to, Miss?

BETTY
Downtown somewhere--anywhere.

CAB DRIVER
Right you are, Miss.

Shuts a door, starts around his car, as we

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. VANCOUVER POLICE HEADQUARTERS - MCKECHNIE'S OFFICE -- 
DAY

McKechnie behind his desk.  Killaine standing across from 
him.  (We enter the middle of scene)

MCKECHNIE
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed 
nincompoop?

KILLAINE
A little of both, sir, and perhaps 
not quiet enough of either.

MCKECHNIE
It won't look pretty good on your 
record, Killaine.  Where's the 
girl now?

KILLAINE
I don't know, sir.

MCKECHNIE
Well, find out.  Who's covering 
her?

KILLAINE
Nobody's covering her, I detached 
the officer assigned to that duty.

McKechnie comes slowly to his feet.  His voice is very 
quiet, and very dangerous.

MCKECHNIE
This girl is a murderess, Killaine.

KILLAINE
I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in 
charge of the case I have the right 
to form that opinion, the right to 
act on it.

MCKECHNIE
Ye have, have ye?

KILLAINE
We lifted seven fairly good prints 
from Miss Mayfield's toilet 
articles.  Washington ought to 
teletype us within a few hours.

MCKECHNIE
(in the same deadly 
quiet voice)
And in the meantime this girl goes 
where she pleases, does what she 
pleases?

KILLAINE
Yes, sir.

McKechnie's eyes go down to his desk.  His hand goes over 
slowly to a yellow telegraph form, face down.  He turns it 
over, then lifts it and reads in a quiet, measured voice:

MCKECHNIE
(reading our loud)
"Superintendent J. Mckechnie, 
Vancouver Police Department.  
Vancouver B.c. Replaying To Your 
E.P. teletype classification No.  
2684 incomplete.  We advise 
identification possible.  Elizabeth 
Kinsolving, arrested Greenwater, 
North Carolina, January 8, 1948, 
on a charge of murder.  Signed, 
FBI., Washington, D.C. H. Cleary, 
Inspector in charge."
(McKechnie looks up 
and meets Killaine's 
eyes)
Have ye any comment, Killaine?

KILLAINE
Identification on possible, Sir.  
Not conclusive.

MCKECHNIE
(reading out loud)
"Superintendent J. McKechnie, 
Vancouver Police Department.  
Replying your inquiry Elizabeth 
Kinsolving.  Subject was indicted, 
first degree murder her husband, 
Lee Kinsolving, January this year.  
Guilty verdict set aside by 
presiding judge.  Prisoner 
discharged, Whereabouts now unknown.  
Fingerprint classification"--
(he holds up the 
other telegram and 
looks at Killaine)
And exact correspondence, Killaine.

Killaine stands white and silent.

MCKECHNIE
(dropping the F.B.I 
telegram and 
continuing to read 
the other)
"Physical description: Age 26, 
Height 5  1 3/4 inches: Weight,

(slowly McKechnie 
drops this wire on 
top of the other -- 
to Killaine)
She bleached her hair, or course.
(pause)
Would your sensibilities be 
offended, if I sent out a general 
alarm to pick up this girl?

KILLAINE
I think you'd be entirely justified, 
sir.

MCKECHNIE
(with a sudden roar)
But you still think she's innocent.

KILLAINE
I do.

he reaches into his pocket, takes out his badge, places it 
on the desk, on top of the two telegrams

KILLAINE
I think you'd like to have this.

McKechnie looks down at it without expression, speaks very 
slowly,

MCKECHNIE
I believe you won decorations during 
the war.

KILLAINE
Two.

McKechnie picks up the badge and holds it on the flat of 
his hand, looking down at it.

MCKECHNIE
There are people in this world who 
don't think a police badge is a 
badge of honor.  I'm not one of 
them.

KILLAINE
Nor I. This is why I gave it to 
you.

MCKECHNIE
(same tone)
You're a young man.  You're 
romantic.  You think a pretty face 
and a clean conscience go together.  
You think a soft voice means a 
soft heart.  You'll grow out of 
that.

KILLAINE
Not too far, I hope.

MCKECHNIE
(suddenly very 
Scotch, the harsh 
and eloquent 
Covenanter)
This badge is not an old newspaper 
you can cast down on the desk.  It 
is not a thing you can give up as 
of no value.  It may be taken from 
you--and you may die defending it.  
But you'll not use it to make cheap 
dramatic gesures with.
(pause; Killaine is 
rocked back on his 
heels)
It's a naked steel of the sword of 
Justice.  Put it back in your pocket 
and hold tight to it--and someday 
you might grow into a worthiness 
ye lack now.

Killaine reaches out and takes the badge.  He looks down 
at it, his face bitter and ashamed.

MCKECHNIE
Get out of here!

KILLAINE
What are my orders, sir?

MCKECHNIE
You think I'm wrong about this bit 
of a girl.  Go out and prove it 
against me!

Killaine steps back, salutes, wheels about and exits scene.  
McKechnie looks after him, expressionlessly.  The door 
CLOSES off.  He presses a button.  A uniformed OFFICER 
enters, McKechnie holds the two telegrams toward him.

MCKECHNIE
Condense these for an immediate 
all-stations pick-up order.

INT. VANCOUVER POLICE HEADQUARTERS -  KILLAINE'S OFFICE -- 
DAY

As he enters.  Crosses to his desk, takes a small, steel 
mirror out of drawer and examines his chin.

CAMERA MOVES TO AN OVER-THE-SHOULDER SHOT

He moves the mirror back until his face is seen in it.  
There is a bitter smile on his mouth.

KILLAINE
Kid Galahad.  The Knight of the 
White Plume.  Jess Holmes, the 
fool killer.  Boy, you look 
wonderful in a tank--with the turret 
closed.

During the speech, a door is OPENED off.  Killaine looks 
up.  Driscoll is standing inside the room.

We are now

PULLED BACK INTO A WIDER SHOT

DRISCOLL
Got a moment, Inspector?

KILLAINE
I've got a year.  Or a second.  
I'm not sure which.

DRISCOLL
You told me when we'd identified 
this fellow--

Killaine nods.

DRISCOLL
We've done that.  He's a San 
Francisco private eye.  Name Martin 
J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E.  Had initials 
in his hat and for once he lived 
where he bought it.  Goble and 
Greer is the firm name.

KILLAINE
(still a bit nasty)
Swimming with his hat on?  That's 
original.

DRISCOLL
If you'd seen the blood on his 
head--and some body had to carry 
him out to sea--

KILLAINE
I understand.  Pity to mess up a 
nice clean boat.

DRISCOLL
(registering 
controlled anger 
at Killaine's manner)
I got through to Greer, his partner 
in the detective business.  Greer 
won't give out.

KILLAINE
(leaning back in 
his chair, half-
closing his eyes)
I'd suggest a telegram.  Something 
like this: Chief of Police, San 
Francisco.  A licensed private 
detective named named Martin J. 
Goble, address so-and-so, has been 
found murdered within our 
jurisdiction.  His partner, name 
something-something Greer, refuses 
to give us any information.  
Correction.  Refuses information 
necessary to our investigation.  
Can you assist?  Signed Detective 
Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, 
British Columbia, Police.
(Killaine opens his 
eyes, looks at 
Driscoll)

DRISCOLL
Send that?

KILLAINE
(indifferently)
Would you?

DRISCOLL
(after a pause)
If you're asking my opinion, no.  
I'd read it to Greer over the phone.  
Ask him if he had any objections.

Killaine stands up, glances at his wristwatch.

KILLAINE
Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if 
it's important.

DRISCOLL
How important would it have to be?  
It's only murder, Inspector.

Killaine goes close to him, suddenly smiles. 

KILLAINE
The Super's just given me the 
sweetest dressing down I've ever 
had.  I'm still reeling from it.  
And believe me, I had it coming.  
I apologize.  What you think is 
important--I think is important.

DRISCOLL
(answering his smile)
Thanks, Inspector.  What are your 
orders about this wire to San 
Francisco?

KILLAINE
Men like you don't need orders.

He turns, exits scene.  Driscoll is now smiling broadly.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - BRANDON'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY

The door opens, Brandon comes in, crosses in the direction 
of the bedroom.

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - BRANDON'S BEDROOM -- DAY

Brandon comes in from the living room, crosses to wall 
safe.  His expression is tight, business-like, his movements 
quick, as if he had a lot to do and didn't intend to waste 
any time.  Opens wall safe, takes a wad of currency from 
it, stuffs currency into breast pocket, re-locks safe.  A 
door buzzer SOUNDS to the door of his apartment.  Brandon 
reacts, starts to exit.

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - BRANDON'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY

Brandon enters from bedroom.  Door buzzer SOUNDS again.  
He picks up his hat and coat, goes to door, opens it.  
Killaine come past Brandon into room, closing the door.

KILLAINE
Time for a little chat?

BRANDON
If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?

KILLAINE
Thanks.  I don't mind.

Brandon throws hat and coat on couch, crosses to liquor 
cabinet, begins to mix a couple of drinks; his back is now 
turned to Killaine, who saunters across room to French 
doors, exits terrace.  Brandon turns with the glasses in 
his hands, then starts after Killaine.

EXT. ROYAL HOTEL - PENTHOUSE TERRACE -- DAY

Killaine is standing against the wall corner, looking down 
at the point where the terrace overlooks Betty's balcony.  
Brandon enters from living room carrying glasses, reacts 
again, controls himself, crosses to Killaine.

BRANDON
Here you are.

Killaine turns, takes a glass.

KILLAINE
Thanks.  Lovely view you have, 
haven't you?

BRANDON
I never notice the view after the 
first week.

KILLAINE
I would.  Fancy waking up every 
morning with that in your lap.
(he gestures towards 
the view)
Wonderful thing, money is.  Remember 
what Somerset Maugham said about 
it ?

BRANDON
I wouldn't know.

KILLAINE
"Money is a sort of sixth sense 
that gives meaning to all the 
others." Very appealing, especially 
to a poor man.

BRANDON
Could we discuss that some other 
time?

KILLAINE
Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.
(pause)
How long since you saw her?

BRANDON
A couple of hours.

KILLAINE
I have a warrant for her arrest.

BRANDON
That must hurt.

KILLAINE
I've always thought you were a 
pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd 
like to go on thinking so.  If you 
tried to help her get away--

BRANDON
Would that make me a heel?

KILLAINE
You'd be breaking the law.

BRANDON
Doesn't answer the question.

KILLAINE
The only answer I have for you.

BRANDON
You passed up a dozen chances to 
arrest her.  What toughened you 
up?

KILLAINE
Information.

BRANDON
Don't kid me.  You don't think she 
murdered Mitchell.

KILLAINE
It could have been an accident.

BRANDON
That COULD BE TOLD.

KILLAINE
Not if she knew she wouldn't be 
believed.

BRANDON
Your concentrating too hard, 
Killaine.  What about Margo West?  
She had a motive.  I guess you 
know by this time whose gun it 
was?

Killaine nods.

BRANDON
And old man Clarendon?  He had a 
motive, too.  Margo and her money.

KILLAINE
Mitchell was killed down here.
(he points)
How could Clarendon get in to do 
it?
(pause)
Or Margo for that matter.

BRANDON
How could Mitchell?  After that 
act he put on up here, is it likely 
she'd let him in?

KILLAINE
She didn't have to.  He could have 
climbed down from here.

Brandon looks down over the wall.  He turns, deadpan.

BRANDON
Mitchell was too drunk.

KILLAINE
Or just drunk enough.  He was with 
her when she registered.  He knew 
where her room was.  You were out 
most of the evening.  There was a 
lot of mess to clean up . Waiters 
coming and going, the door standing 
open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to 
grab a drink for himself, then 
wandered out on this balcony, then 
realized betty's balcony was just 
below yours.

BRANDON
Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, 
Killaine.

KILLAINE
You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I 
still want Betty Mayfield.  Where 
is she?

BRANDON
No idea.

Phone rings off, in the living room.

BRANDON
Excuse me.  My phone.

He turns, exits scene.  Killaine stands a moment, looking 
down from the edge of the terrace, then follows Brandon.

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - BRANDON'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY

Brandon is just lifting the receiver.

BRANDON
Hello.

His expression tightens, he glances quickly towards the 
French doors as Killaine appears in them and strolls into 
the living room.  Brandon turns his back to Killaine.

BRANDON
(into phone)
Sorry.  It's not very convenient 
just now.

INT. HUDSON BAY COMPANY'S DEPARTMENT STORE - WAITING ROOM -- 
DAY

SHOPPERS, MEN, WOMEN and CHILDREN, etc., sitting around.  
In the background a line of phone booths.  CAMERA PICKS 
OUT  a deadpan, nondescript-looking MAN who might be a 
dick as he stands up from a chair, crosses towards phone 
booths, CAMERA WITH HIM.  Phone booths are all full.  He 
stops before a booth, through the glass door of which Betty 
can be seen on the phone.  She catches his eye, turns away 
quickly.  The Man nonchalantly lights a cigarette, leans 
against the booth.

CLOSE SHOT

BETTY
(into phone in booth)
I had no right to call you anyway.  
I've made you enough trouble.  I--
I think I know what to do--if 
they'll let me.

Her eyes turn to look at the man outside the booth.  He is 
not looking at her.

CUT TO:

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - BRANDON'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY

BRANDON ON PHONE

Killaine, behind him in a chair; has picked up a magazine.

BRANDON
(casual voice)
It sounds like a fair location.  
Could you be a little more exact?

CUT TO:

INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - PHONE BOOTH -- DAY

BETTY ON PHONE

BETTY
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's 
store.  That man last night--the 
one that followed me--

CUT TO:

INT. BRANDON'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY

BRANDON
I don't think that's on the market 
anymore.  I'd like something much 
closer to the water.

Killaine is listening, but he does not look up.

BRANDON
Cant be too close for me.  Right 
across the street from it suits 
me.  Anything else listed?

INT. PHONE BOOTH -- DAY

BETTY ON PHONE

BETTY
(into phone, low 
penetrating voice, 
her mouth very 
close to the 
mouthpiece)
There's another man--right outside 
the booth here.  I never saw him 
Before.

CUT TO: 

INT. BRANDON'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY

BRANDON
You're probably mistaken about 
that.  Let's get together sand 
talk it over.  There's always a 
solution to these problems.  But 
it must be near the water.  Quite 
near--
(pause)
Yes, if you don't mind waiting.

CUT TO:

INT. PHONE BOOTH -- DAY

BETTY ON PHONE 

Showing the Man is still standing outside the booth.  He 
glances in casually.  Betty turns her head into phone.

BETTY
Close to the water.  Like last 
night.  I'll try.  Goodbye.

She hangs up, stands a moment as if mustering her courage, 
then turns.

INT. WAITING ROOM NEAR BETTY'S PHONE BOOTH -- DAY

The Man is standing there, smoking.  Betty opens the door, 
comes out past him, not looking at him, then turns with a 
quick decision and faces him.

BETTY
(to man)
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

He has his hand on the knob of the booth door, holding it. 
He smiles quickly

MAN
Don't give it a thought, Miss.  
Matter of fact, waiting is my trade.

A BIG WOMAN pushes past them, starts to leave herself into 
the booth he is about to enter.  The man reacts smoothly.

MAN
(to big woman)
Pardon me, Madam.  Is that your 
handkerchief?

He points to a spot on the floor behind her.  She steps 
back and turns.  He glides into the booth, draws the door 
shut, winks at Betty through the glass.  Betty hides her 
face as she turns away.  The Big Woman is  furious.

CUT TO:

INT. BRANDON'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY

He has just left the phone and crossed to make another 
drink, Killaine tosses the magazine aside and stands up.

KILLAINE
No more for me, thanks.  Remember 
what I said.  I can't interfere 
with the law.

BRANDON
Where would she go, anyway.  Don't 
tell me you haven't got her covered.

Killaine just looks at him, then nods, turns away.

BRANDON
Mitchell was a heel.  We both know 
that.  Why take it for granted 
that somebody in the hotel knocked 
him off?

Killaine doesn't answer.

BRANDON
You forgetting the gag line, 
Killaine.  The police don't take 
anything for granted.

KILLAINE
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often.  
So long.

BRANDON
Wait a minute.  I'll go with you.

Crosses, picks up hat and coat, reaches Killaine at the 
door, they start out.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - ELEVATOR -- DAY

BRANDON AND KILLAINE

KILLAINE
(casually)
You do a lot of real estate trading, 
Brandon?

BRANDON
Now and then.  Mostly just for the 
fun of it.

KILLAINE
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.

BRANDON
(with a faint smile)
I buy my shirts by the dozen.  
Fortunately.

KILLAINE
(glancing at the 
elevator operator)
Where did it all come from?  Or is 
that a permissible question?

Elevator stops.  OTHER PEOPLE get in.  Elevator starts 
down again.

WIPE TO:

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - BY ELEVATOR -- DAY

Elevator reaches lobby floor, doors open, people come out.  
Killaine and Brandon separately.  Brandon first.  He waits 
for Killaine.

BRANDON
I had a father who knew how to 
steal.

KILLAINE
(puzzled)
What?

BRANDON
You asked me where it all came 
from.

KILLAINE
(smiles)
Oh.  That was just one of those 
idle questions.  One doesn't expect 
an answer.

Brandon nods, turns towards the desk, Killaine following.  
Campbell the manager, is behind the desk, and a clerk.  
The clerk, seeing Brandon, reaches mail out of the box, 
hands it to Brandon, who stands looking over.

KILLAINE
(to Campbell)
I think I'd like to take another 
look at Mr. Mitchell's room.

Brandon glances at him quickly, then back to his mail.

KILLAINE
I don't know why.  As a matter of 
fact, I don't know anything.

CAMPBELL
(polite but rather 
cold)
It's about time you did--know 
something.

KILLAINE
I agree with you perfectly.  But 
when did time ever help a fool?

Brandon gives another quick glance, then strolls off along 
the lobby towards the main Hotel entrance, still looking 
at his mail as he walks.  Killaine looks after him.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Killaine goes over to where Handley is sitting, drops into 
a chair beside him, takes out his crested cigarette case, 
takes a cigarette, then with an after-thought, offers case 
to Handley, which brings then close together, as Handley 
takes cigarette.

HANDLEY
Nothing.  She hasn't shown.

KILLAINE
Check the boat?

HANDLEY
Gore's out doing it now.

Killaine gives him a light.  They both puff.  Killaine 
pits cigarette case away.

KILLAINE
(pretending to stifle 
a yawn)
Must be almost tea-time
(moves to get up)
I'll be in Mitchell's room.

Handley nods slightly.  Killaine gets up, starts to move 
back to the desk.  Campbell stands there waiting for him.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. STREET - WATERFRONT -- DAY

BETTY WALKING CAMERA FOLLOWING

Her hands are deep in the pockets of her coat, head bent 
forward.  She comes under a street sign, looks up.  The 
sign says: FRONT STREET

SOUND of a car coming up behind her.  SOUND indicates it 
is breaking to stop.  Betty becomes rigid, then very slowly 
turns her head, as though she expected to find a police 
car had come up behind her.

BRANDON (O.S.)
Hop in.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Showing Brandon's convertible, Brandon leaning out.  Betty 
crosses the sidewalk, gets into the car.  HOLD ON THE CAR 
as it starts up, SHOOTING FROM A NATURAL ANGLE.

BETTY
I hated to go to that place.  I 
almost went to the police station 
instead.

BRANDON
No percentage in that.

BETTY
They're going to arrest me.

BRANDON
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.

BETTY
(as the car turns 
into Ford Street)
I have my own warrant.  Stop a 
minute, please.

Brandon looks at her, puzzled, brings the car to a stop; 
sits staring at her.  Background of harbor ships, Betty 
draws something out of her pocket--a paper--and hands it 
to him.  He takes it, opens it, reads it aloud, in a low 
voice.

BRANDON
(reading aloud)
"Dear Inspector Killaine: This is 
goodbye.  You were right, I had a 
secret.  You were right, I changed 
my name.  I tried to hide from the 
past and I walked into almost the 
same situation that I had run away 
from.  I didn't kill Larry Mitchell, 
but I can't prove it.  I couldn't 
prove it the other time, either.  
Where I am going, nothing has to 
be proved.  There's a lot of water 
between Vancouver and the U.S.A. 
In  that, and in you.  Vancouver 
has been kind to me.  I think you 
will understand.  Betty Mayfield.

Brandon stops reading, his face is tight, and grim.  Slowly 
he refolds the note and turns to look at Betty.

BRANDON
If you meant it, you wouldn't show 
it to me, Betty.
(pause)
Or am I supposed to deliver it to 
dear Inspector Killaine?

BETTY
(in a half-wild 
tone)
Wrote it in the waiting room of 
the Hudson Bay Store.  With 
somebody's Pekingese trying to 
climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're 
right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it.  
All I know is that I'm licked.

BRANDON
(very slowly)
There's a lot of water between 
Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note 
is a suicide note.  After you're 
gone where would they look for 
you?
(long pause)
Why would they look for you?  
Darkness, and open water, and a 
fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a 
pocket full of money.  And if I 
helped you, I'd be committing a 
crime, or so they tell me.

BETTY
That wasn't why I called you.  Why 
did I hope--when I hadn't any right 
to hope?

BRANDON
How bad is it?  Bad enough for--
(he taps pointing 
to the note)

BETTY
Yes.  I've never been very far 
from it, for a long time.  Will 
you do something for me?

Brandon nods.

BETTY
Take me where I haven't the courage 
to take myself.

BRANDON
How bad is the other thing?  The 
secret?

BETTY
I was tried for murdering my 
husband.  Guilty.  The judge set 
the verdict aside.  There was one 
man on the jury--
(she pauses, shakes 
her head)
--but he was afraid.  They were 
all afraid--of my father-in-law.  
That man followed me last night--
he came from him of course.  My 
father-in-law will never give up.  
Never.  He promised me that.
(she laughs a little)
So I came to Vancouver, B.C. As 
far away as I can get from North 
Carolina.  And it happens all over 
again.  Almost the same thing.  
Almost the same way.  Do you wonder 
about this--

She reaches to take the note from his hand.  He pulls it 
away from her.

BRANDON
This is the ace, Betty.  But not 
of spades.  They'll find out about 
the other.  They might know already.  
And when they get this--
(he holds up the 
note again)
What would they look for?  Where?  
Out there somewhere?
(he points towards 
the open water 
beyond the ships)

BETTY
They'll look for you.

BRANDON
I run over to Victoria.  Play some 
golf with some people I know.  Do 
it all the time.  That's why I 
have a cabin cruiser.  Custom-
built.Forty knots.  Mr Clark Brandon 
an almost gentleman of almost 
complete leisure.  Member of six 
golf clubs.  Broke 70 once on the 
Shaughnessy Heights Course.  You 
have to be good to do that, And if 
you look out of a front window of 
the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in 
a few hours you can look right 
down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the 
Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He 
always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's 
a rather lonely man.

BETTY
(staring at him, 
fascinated)
And Betty Mayfield--

BRANDON
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and 
nowhere.  Of course she might have 
run away--if she knew how.  And 
where to go.  She might have dyed 
her hair.  Bleached it before 
probably.
(Betty nods)
And changed her name again.  But 
look at this note.
(he holds it up)
And look at her room in the hotel.  
Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a 
rag except what she stood up in.  
You don't run away like that.  Not 
if you are young and beautiful.  
No chance.

BETTY
(catching a little 
enthusiasm from 
him)
But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't 
they think of that?

BRANDON
If they had any reason to.  Why 
make it tough for themselves?  Why 
go to all that trouble?  Here's an 
open book.  Close it.  No reason 
to keep it open.  She was a nice 
girl, anyway.  And perhaps she 
didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps 
she didn't kill the other one.  
You never know.  Give her the 
benefit of the doubt.  Leave her 
stay where she is.  Close the book.  
Finis.

BETTY
Killaine...

BRANDON
The best interference runner we've 
got.  He thinks he's in love with 
you--and he's a gentleman.  Come 
here, baby.

He pulls her towards him, holds her in his arms, and kisses 
her.

BRANDON
I'm not.  Or I wouldn't be doing 
this right now.
(softly)
Even if I didn't like you, I'd 
have to do it.  Like the guy that 
was dealt thirteen spades in a 
bridge hand.  Or filled an ace-
high flush.  You couldn't get him 
out of that game to give him the 
Pulitzer Prize.

They pull apart.  Brandon starts the car again.  As it 
gets into motion, he looks forward through the windshield, 
brakes suddenly, with a grim expression.

WHAT HE SEES

SHOOTING FORWARD THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD OF THE CAR

Along the block, at the end of which is Charlie's Place.  
The sign can be made out vaguely.  A police car stands in 
front of the door.

BACK TO BRANDON AND BETTY

BRANDON
(with forced 
carelessness)
Must be raid day at Magruder's.  
They always raid him before he 
opens, so he won't lose any 
business.

WIDER SHOT - EXTERIOR OF THE CAR

As Brandon turns it in a fast U-Turn, CAMERA PANS IT OUT F 
SIGHT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION, THEN PANS BACK TO PICK UP 
THE POLICE CAR IN FRONT OF MAGRUDER'S.

CLOSE SHOT of the Police car - uniformed CHAUFFEUR at the 
wheel.  One of the car doors is standing open.

EXT. CHARLIE'S PLACE -- DAY

PAN TO THE ENTRANCE OF CHARLIE'S

Another uniformed COP is standing at the door.  He pushes 
the door open, looks inside, up the staircase.

CAMERA PANS TO SHOOT UP THE DARK, EMPTY STAIRS

WIPE TO:

INT. CHARLIE'S PLACE -- DAY

As seen before, except that the place is now tidied up, 
the tables are in order, arranged for the night.  A door 
at the back opens and a PLAIN CLOTHES DICK, one we have 
not yet seen, comes through, starts walking rapidly in the 
direction of the street stairs.  Through the open door we 
HEAR Driscoll's voice.

DRISCOLL (O.S.)
(not too loud)
I want a man from the I-Bureau 
down here as soon as possible.  
There's some stuff in the waste 
basket I'm afraid to handle.

CUT TO:

INT. CHARLIE'S PLACE - MAGRUDER'S OFFICE -- DAY

As Driscoll replaces phone, turns to face Magruder, who is 
handcuffed, with a Man standing beside him.  Magruder is 
scowling.  Driscoll brings up his left hand, showing on a 
spread handkerchief the sawed-off belly gun that Magruder 
took away from Goble and put in his desk drawer.

DRISCOLL
What always throws me about people 
like you is that you're so stupid.  
Don't you know these things have 
numbers on them?  And that they 
have to be registered if they're 
owned legally?  And that if we 
find a man dead with his pocket's 
empty--and identify him and find 
out he's a private detective from 
San Francisco--

MAGRUDER
(tough)
It needs music.

DRISCOLL
(ignoring him and 
continuing right 
on)
All we have to do is call the San 
Francisco Police and get numbers 
for his guns.  For the love of the 
Saints, Magruder, if you're going 
into the murder business, why don't 
you learn a few rules?  You must 
have been pretty desperate to move 
him out of here in broad daylight.

Magruder reacts.  This one catches him right square on the 
point of the chin.

DRISCOLL
(softly)
Don't you know we have people down 
in the district working for us?  
They might look like tramps to 
you, and some of them are.  But 
they have eyes.

MAGDRUDER
(hoarsely)
The guy pulled a gun on me.  I 
thought it was a stick-up.  I hit 
him with a sap.  Why wouldn't I?  
Maybe I hit him too hard, and it 
scared me.  I wanted to get him 
away from here.  A guy like me 
don't always get believed by guys 
like you.

DRISCOLL
You had over sixteen hundred dollars 
in your pocket, a thousand of them 
in twenty-dollar bills.  With a 
kind of new look about them at 
that.  Would you be interested in 
what I think about this, Magruder?

Magruder doesn't answer.  He is beginning to look very 
groggy.

DRISCOLL
(sharply to the 
other dick)
Hold him.  He's trying to sag on 
us.

The other dick straightens Magruder up, pushes him against 
the wall.  Magruder's eyes are rolling in his head.

DRISCOLL
(mercilessly)
This man Goble rented the car, 
gave a false name.  He had no 
licence, no identification.  But 
he put up a sufficient deposit.  
He was a suspicious man.  He was 
on a dubious errand.  He had a gun 
in his pocket and I'm thinking one 
of these manila envelopes--
(he points to the 
waste basket)
Contained those sheets of blank 
paper which he was going to sell 
for money.  And get out before 
anybody looked at what he'd sold.  
You had the money, Magruder.  But 
you didn't give it to him.  You 
killed him instead.

Magruder starts to sag again.

DRISCOLL
(more gently)
Perhaps you didn't mean to kill 
him.  But here he was dead, and 
his car was outside in the street.  
So you brought it around to the 
alley and you carried the man down 
to it, and you drove him away.  
And what happened to him after 
that, nobody knows until he was 
picked out of the water of the 
Sound, dead.  But not long dead.  
Where did you leave the car, 
Magruder?  Who helped you?  What 
boat did you have?
(pauses. His voice 
changes to a dry 
business-like tone 
addressing the 
other dick)
All right.  Take him in.  Set him 
down.  Give him what he wants to 
make him comfortable.  And get a 
stenographer.  And warn him.  And 
don't rough him.  He's a nice little 
man.  All he wants is to collect 
his thoughts.  And then he'll tell 
us the whole story in his own words.
(his voice becomes 
positively corny)
Won't you, Magruder, darling?

Magruder pitches forward to the floor in a dead faint.  
The two detectives stand looking at him.

DRISCOLL
(somberly)
He'll be giving the priest a bad 
time, this one.  Maybe You'd better 
call an ambulance.  He might have 
a wonky ticker.

EXT. VANCOUVER YACHT CLUB BUILDING PARKING SPACE IN FRONT -- 
DAY

CAMERA PICKS OUT BRANDON'S SEDAN which has just parked.  
Brandon and Betty are getting out.

CLOSER SHOT - ON BRANDON AND BETTY

BRANDON
Over this way.

They start towards the corner of the building away from 
the entrance.

EXT. NARROW WOODEN WALK ALONG THE SIDE OF THE YACHT CLUB 
BUILDING -- DAY

Brandon stops at the padlocked door, unlocks it, opens it.  
They start through.

INT. VANCOUVER YACHT CLUB - BOATHOUSE -- DAY

The seaward end is open, a big cabin cruiser is moored in 
the slip, a wooden ladder going down to it.  Brandon goes 
down the ladder to deck of cruiser, steadies it by pulling 
on the line, helps Betty down, then down into the cockpit.

INT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE - COCKPIT -- DAY

SHOOTING DOWN THE SHORT COMPANIONWAY

Brandon loads Betty down the companionway to the cabin of 
the cruiser.  It is paneled, with curtained windows, 
luxurious.

BRANDON
You'll be safe here.  I won't be 
long.
(puts a bunch of 
keys on the table)
Help yourself to anything you want.  
The galley's through there.
(he points to a 
door up forward)
You can make coffee if you like.

BETTY
(looking around 
here)
This must have cost a fortune.

BRANDON
It did, but it never paid off--
until now.
(he looks at his 
watch)
I ought to be back within an hour.  
We can't leave until near dark 
anyway.

BETTY
Do you have to leave the note?

BRANDON
It's the frame on the picture.  
But not if you say so.

He takes the note out of his pocket and holds it out.  
Betty doesn't touch it.

BRANDON
I'd still go through--even if I 
ended up in jail.

BETTY
You wouldn't like it.  I've been 
there.

BRANDON
(quietly)
My father died in jail, and he was 
twice the man I am.

Betty just stares at him.

BRANDON
(holding up the 
letter)
Well?

BETTY
(in a choked voice)
You leave it.

She turns away quickly, Brandon stands a moment, looking 
at her, then turns back and EXITS SCENE.

WIPE TO:

INT. POLICE CAR IN MOTION -- DAY

SHOOTING FORWARD THROUGH POLICE CAR WINDSHIELD

Police radio is on.  From it we HEAR:

VOICE (FROM RADIO)
C.V.P.L. Vancouver Police 
Department.  Repeating.  All points 
Bulletin No.  611.  General alarm.

Carolina.  Height five feet one 
and a half inches.  Weight 118 
pounds.  Hair blonde, may be dyed

Vancouver City Police, Vancouver, 
B.C., for F.P. Classification.

CUT TO:

INT. VANCOUVER ROYAL HOTEL - MITCHELL'S ROOM -- DAY

A handsome table radio, Gore standing beside it.  The 
continuation of broadcast in previous scene, without break, 
but with a difference in tone, due to the different 
instrument.

VOICE (FROM RADIO)
Outlying cities and towns please 
rebroadcast.  Coast Guard stations 
please rebroadcast.  Suspect may 
attempt to cross border.  C.V.P.L. 
Vancouver City Police, Vancouver, 
B.C. I will repeat this bulletin.

Gore reaches across, shuts the radio off, turns, CAMERA 
PULLS BACK TO A WIDER SHOT OF MITCHELL'S ROOM which is not 
typical, not very expensive hotel room, but with some 
personal furniture such as table lamps, a shelf of books, 
a few indications that this has become the home of someone.

Gore moves towards the bed, Killaine is going through the 
contents of a suitcase.  He has underwear, shirts, socks, 
etc., spread out all around the bed cover.

GORE
She didn't seem the type to lam 
out--even if she got the chance.  
That stuff was all gone through 
last night.  Anything special you're 
looking for, Inspector?

KILLAINE
I'll know when I find it.

GORE
I guess I'm just ballast around 
here.

Killaine doesn't answer.  He straightens up with a very 
fancy thin gold cigarette case in his hand.  He opens it.

GORE
You get those from rich women--if 
you are the kind of guy Mitchell 
was.

Killaine dumps the cigarettes out of the case and holds 
the inside against the light.  His gaze becomes fixed.

KILLAINE
(reading)
"G.G. Market one-eight-four-two."

GORE
Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of 
those fancy ladies.  Must have 
been very fancy, if he scratched 
her phone number in gold.

KILLAINE
(ignoring him, 
speaking to himself)
Market... It seems to me that's a 
San Francisco exchange.

INT. BEER TAVERN - BASEMENT -- DAY

Brandon is seated at a small table, with a bottle and glass 
of beer in front of him.  He takes Betty's suicide note 
out his pocket, reads it.

CAMERA MOVES IN ENOUGH TO SHOW WHAT HE IS READING

He refolds it, holds it a moment, lost in thought, then 
puts it away in his pocket, glances at his wrist watch, 
stands up, starts out of scene, leaving beer almost 
untasted.

INT. THE ROYAL VANCOUVER HOTEL - BETTY'S ROOM -- DAY

As Killaine comes in He moves noiselessly around the room, 
glancing at this and that, goes closet, comes back with an 
over-night case, which he puts on the bed.  It is locked.  
He gets out a bunch of keys, tried two or three, opens it.  
He searches inside the over-night bag and comes up with a 
packet of travelers checks.

CLOSE ON THE PACKET OF TRAVELERS CHECKS TO SHOW THE 
DENOMINATIONS OF $500 EACH AND THAT THE PACKET IS QUITE A 
THICK WAD

Killaine replaces them in the over-night bag, re-locks it, 
puts it back  in the closet, starts out towards balcony.

INT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE -- DAY

Betty is stretched out on a bunk, smoking, NOISE is HEARD 
off, CREAKING WOOD STEPS.  She jumps to her feet, starts 
towards the companionway.

EXT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE - COCKPIT -- DAY

As Brandon comes down off ladder and Betty comes up 
companionway.

BRANDON
(tightly)
Killaine's wise.  We can't wait 
any longer.  Here, put this on.
(he opens locker, 
picks out an oilskin 
coat, hand sit to 
her)
But stay out of sight until we 
clear the harbor.  I'll tell you 
when.
(gets another oilskin 
out of the locker, 
puts it on himself)

BETTY
Killaine's wise to what?

Without answering, Brandon slips past her, down 
companionway.

INT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE -- DAY

As Brandon enters, peeling off his overcoat and jacket, 
tosses overcoat and hat aside, opens locker with push-back 
door, hangs jacket up inside, takes out a heavy sweater 
which he slips on, then a seamen's pea-jacket which he 
also puts on.  He reaches far in and comes out holding a 
.38 automatic, slips it into the inside pocket of the pea 
jacket, pulls locker door closed, starts out.

EXT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE - COCKPIT -- DAY

Betty has put on her oilskin coat as Brandon comes up 
companionway, slips behind the wheel and starts the motors.  
He yells something at her, but the roar of the motors drowns 
it out.  He points. She nods, goes back down companionway.  
Brandon casts off, cruiser starts to back out of the slip.

EXT. YACHT ANCHORAGE -- DAY

Cruiser backs in towards CAMERA, swings around, starts in 
a wide curve towards the harbor entrance, moving very fast.  
Brandon alone is seen.  The cruiser picks up still more 
speed and head off into the distance.

WIPE TO:

INT. ROYAL HOTEL - OUTSIDE BRANDON'S PENTHOUSE -- DAY

Elevator comes up, opens, Campbell and Gore come out.  
Campbell crosses to penthouse door, presses bell, then 
turns to Gore.

CAMPBELL
I'm getting a little tired of this, 
Sergeant.  Mr. Brandon's a valued 
guest in this hotel.  We've known 
him for a long time.  I don't like 
this prowling into people's rooms.

He presses the bell again.

GORE
How many people in your hotel know 
a man was murdered here, 
Mr.Campbell?  Apart from you and 
the people questioned?

CAMPBELL
(shortly)
None, as far as I know.

GORE
And you don't like our methods, 
huh?

Campbell gives him a look, takes out the passkey, and 
unlocks door, starts in.  Gore moves past him, turns and 
blocks him.

GORE
That's all.  Thanks, Mr. Campbell.

CAMPBELL
I insist--

GORE
That's all.  Thanks, Mr. Campbell.

He pushes the door shut, pushing Campbell out with it.  He 
puts on the night latch, grins and starts across living 
room to French doors to terrace.

CUT TO:

EXT. THE VANCOUVER ROYAL HOTEL - BETTY'S ROOM - BALCONY -- 
DAY

Killaine standing, looking up at end wall towards the wall 
of the penthouse terrace.  He looks down at the chaise on 
which Mitchell's body was found.  He goes to it, wheels it 
over so it is close to the end wall.  His eyes measure the 
distance from the chaise up to the top of the parapet wall 
of the penthouse terrace.  Gore appears IN THE SHOT ABOVE.  
He looks down.

KILLAINE
(calling up to him)
I'm coming up.

He goes down to the corner of the balcony wall, steps up 
on it, steadying himself with a hand against the steep end 
wall.  He turns his body so that he is standing sideways, 
rather unsteadily, and reaches up.  His hands are about 
two feet short of being able to reach the top of the wall 
at which Gore stands.  Killaine gathers himself for a jump, 
springs, catches the top of the wall with one hand, swings 
outwards, glances down.

WHAT HE SEES

Sheer drop of 100 feet to the stone terrace outside the 
hotel lobby.

ANGLE UP SHOWING KILLAINE DANGLING BY ONE HAND FROM TERRACE 
ABOVE

Gore reaching down for him.  Killaine's body swings in 
again.  With a jerk he gets the other hand up, laboriously 
pulls himself up, and walks up the wall, CAMERA FOLLOWS 
HIM.  Gore reaches to help him.

KILLAINE
(tightly, straining 
with effort)
I'm all right.

He gets a leg over the penthouse wall, breathing hard.

EXT. PENTHOUSE BALCONY -- DAY

REVERSE SHOT ANGLE DOWN LOOKING DOWN FROM THE TERRACE TO 
THE VIEW BELOW

Gore is standing by the wall, Killaine astride of it.  He 
gets over to the balcony floor, stands up, wipes his hands 
off.

GORE
(shaken)
That's pretty risky business, 
Inspector.

KILLAINE
Somebody did it twice last night--
in the dark.

He points down.  Gore looks over the wall, downwards.

WHAT HE SEES.

Portion of Betty's balcony and the chaise almost directly 
below him.

KILLAINE (O.S.)
Once to put that in the position 
where it is now.  And the second 
time to move it where we found it.

TWO SHOT - KILLAINE AND GORE

On the balcony.

KILLAINE
Not too hard, is it?

GORE
(staring at him)
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--

KILLAINE
(quietly)
There wasn't any motive...let's 
try out the act.

Gore steps back.  Killaine puts his hand in his pocket and 
brings out a gun, which looks very like the death gun.

KILLAINE
I have a gun.  It's not loaded.  
Pretend it is.  I'm drunk.  I took 
the gun away from Margo West.  Now 
I've said something to you that 
you don't like.  I don't like the 
look in your eyes, either.  I've 
pulled the gun.  Take it away from 
me.  And while you're taking it 
away from me, it goes off.  Ready?

Gore nods.

KILLAINE
Let's go.

Gore suddenly swarms him.  There is a brief sharp struggle.  
Gore gets his hand over the gun.  It goes down as they 
fight for it.  Gore turns it in toward Killaine's body.  
There is a sharp click.  Gore steps back with the gun in 
his hand.

KILLAINE
Was that about the right angle?

GORE
I think so.

KILLAINE
Where's the shell?

GORE
Should be over there.

Points to the angle of the wall.

KILLAINE
Pick it up.  Put it in your pocket.

Gore pretends to do so.

KILLAINE
The same with the gun.

Gore puts the gun in his pocket.

KILLAINE
You've got a dead man on your hands.  
You killed jim--even if it wasn't 
murder.  What are you going to do 
about it?

GORE
If I've got any sense I'm going to 
call headquarters.

KILLAINE
They'll probably believe you.  But 
they'll want to know what you were 
fighting about.  Why Mitchell had 
a gun.  You'll tell them a simple 
story.  They'll pretend it sounds 
all right to them.  Now you're 
headquarters.  How does it sound 
to you?

GORE
Before I took the story and closed 
the case, I'd want to know a lot 
more about these people.  I'd want 
to know just about everything about 
them.

KILLAINE
(nodding)
Exactly.  Now I'm the killer.  And 
there's something I don't want you 
to know.  Something that would 
destroy my comfortable life, rob 
me of my friends, my position.

GORE
Such as?

KILLAINE
Assume there is something to hid.  
I go to a lot of trouble.  What do 
I do?  What would you do?

GORE
Do I know who lives down there?

KILLAINE
You can find out.

GORE
Do I know that she's out of the 
room?  Likely to be out of it for 
some time?

KILLAINE
You can find out the first part.  
The second part you have to take a 
chance on.

GORE
Pretty big chance, huh?

KILLAINE
You've got a dead man on your hands.  
Like this.

He allows himself to collapse down on the floor, against 
the wall.

GORE
Right--

He bends down over Killaine, gets a fireman's lift on him--
get's him up, drapes him over the wall, half on one side 
and half on the other, his head and shoulders on the inside.  
He straightens up, takes a firm grip on Killaine's wrists, 
and eases him down over the wall.  Gore's head and shoulders 
follow until he is lying across the wall on his stomach.

ANGLE UP - UPWARD REVERSE SHOT FROM BETTY'S BALCONY

Showing Killaine's body dangling directly over the chair.  
Gore comes as far down as he can.  Killaine has only a few 
feet to fall.  Killaine looks down, then up at Gore.

KILLAINE
Let go.

Gore releases his wrists.  Killaine sprawls down on the 
chaise, almost rolls over it, saves himself, lies down on 
his side.  Gore climbs over the wall, lowers himself, hangs 
by his hands, looks down, lets go with one hand, drops, 
lands rather heavily on the balcony near the chaise, goes 
down on his hands and knees.  He stands up, dusts himself 
off, lifts the chaise with Killaine on it, and wheels it 
about six feet away to the position where it was found 
with Mitchell's body.  Killaine stands up off the chaise.

KILLAINE
Next?

Gore reaches into his pocket, takes out the gun and a match.

GORE
(holding the match 
up)
This is the shell.
(tossing it over in 
the corner)
What about the gun?

KILLAINE
Well.  What about it?

GORE
I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed 
it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide.  
If I take it out and lose it, no 
suicide.  If I leave it here....no 
suicide.

KILLAINE
So?

GORE
I've got to find a way to handle 
it, openly.  Like Brandon.

Killaine nods.

GORE
(doubtful again)
How did he know he'd get the chance?  
He couldn't have arranged it.

KILLAINE
He could have tried.  If he was up 
there in the dark, listening, he'd 
know when she came home, know when 
she found Mitchell dead, know what 
she did about it.  If she 
telephoned, he'd probably hear 
that.

GORE
And she did give him the chance, 
the way it worked out.

KILLAINE
If she didn't--if luck was against 
him--he wipes the gun off, reaches 
the wall up there--drops it on the 
chaise.

GORE
No suicide.

KILLAINE
Did we ever really think it was 
suicide?

GORE
You win, Inspector.  You win all 
along the line.  Why didn't we 
think of Brandon before--or did we--
some of us.
(pause, then 
answering himself)
Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a 
suspect thinks he's safe, you go 
on letting him think he's safe.  
Wait for a mistake.

KILLAINE
And a motive--which we haven't 
got.  So this could all be a dream.

Gore nods silently.  Killaine reaches in his pocket, takes 
out Mitchell's thin gold case, opens it, looks down.

KILLAINE
Market one-eight-four-two.

He looks up at Gore.

GORE
Greer and Goble in the Call 
Building, San Francisco.  Just 
like you thought...Two murders in 
two days.  Different places, 
different methods, different people.  
Nothing connects them, but a 
telephone number.

KILLAINE
(softly)
A think wire---but very, very 
strong.  Let's get out of here.

As they start out.

WIPE TO:

INT. THE SEA - OPEN WATER -- NIGHT

LONG SHOT

Cabin cruiser coming into SHOT at high speed.

CLOSER SHOT - CABIN CRUISER

Brandon is behind the wheel, Betty beside him.  She is 
looking back over her shoulder.

BRANDON
See anything?

BETTY
I can still see the shoreline.  
The moon is rising.

BRANDON
There would be a moon tonight.

Betty shivers a little.

BRANDON
Cold?

BETTY
Frozen.

BRANDON
Go down into the cabin and get 
yourself a drink.  Careful how you 
go, we're hitting the swell now.

Betty starts to move from the seat towards the companionway.

INT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE -- NIGHT

As Betty comes in.  The cruiser has begun to pitch and 
roll.  She makes her way along the cabin.  The cruiser 
gives a lurch, Betty is thrown off balance.  She grabs a 
door handle.  Door is pulled open.  Clothes are seen hanging 
inside.  The cruiser gives another lurch and Betty is thrown 
the other way, almost into the closet.  Her hand plunges 
in among  the clothes.  Her expression shows she has touched 
something that startles her.

SHOT REVEALING INSIDE THE CLOSET

Betty separates clothes and we SEE an empty gun holster 
hanging on a hook against the back wall of the closet.  
She stands motionless, staring at it, then notices Brandon's 
jacket hanging untidily on a hook with the inside pocket 
exposed and a corner of her own suicide note showing.

CLOSE ON THE INSIDE OF THE JACKET POCKET AND THE EXPOSED 
CORNER OF THE ENVELOPE.  BETTY'S HAND ENTERS THE SHOT 

and she draws the envelope from the pocket.

INT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE -- NIGHT

As Betty closes the closet door, crosses to bunk.  The 
cruiser is pitching.  She stands holding the suicide note 
envelope finally turns it over, draws out the note, replaces 
it.  Then with a quick movement, she starts towards 
companionway.

EXT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE - COCKPIT -- NIGHT

ANGLE ON BACK TOWARDS THE BOILING WAKE

Brandon is staring straight ahead of him, tight-lipped.  
There is a DISTANT SOUND OF A PLANE.  Brandon looks up, 
searching the sky without changing expression.  Betty comes 
back up the companionway, sits down in a corner of the 
seat.

BETTY
I decided I didn't want a 
drink...I'm beginning to wonder.

BRANDON
Wonder what?

BETTY
If you're doing all this just for 
me.

BRANDON
That, and the fun of it.

BETTY
I thought you had to be back to 
the hotel.  To leave my--my note.

BRANDON
That's right.

Silently, Betty takes out the note and holds it towards 
him.  Brandon glances at it.  He cocks his ear towards the 
PLANE NOISE.

BRANDON
See anything up there?

As betty looks up, he lets go of the wheel, and makes a 
sudden grab for the wrist of the hand holding the note.  
There is a short, sharp struggle.  Brandon has the note.  
The wheel swings wildly and the cabin cruiser keels over 
into a hard turn.  Brandon thrusts the note into his pocket, 
grabs the wheel, wrenches it around, gets the cruiser going 
on course again.  Betty leans in a corner of a seat, away 
from him.

BETTY
Funny, I never thought of you that 
way.  You were so close too.  We 
were all pretty stupid about you.

BRANDON
(tightly)
Including Killaine.

BETTY
(softly)
Including Killaine...I still can't 
think of you that way.

BRANDON
(staring straight 
ahead)
I told you my father died in jail.  
He stole a fortune.  Most of it 
pretty dirty money.  I don't care 
to have that known.

BETTY
(same tone)
Larry Mitchell found out.  So you 
killed him.



BRANDON
In a way.

BETTY
If it was an accident, you could 
have told the truth.

BRANDON
So could you.  But our records 
were a little against us.

BETTY
What your father did doesn't condemn 
you.

BRANDON
Nobody believed I wasn't in on it.  
I was just a dumb-smart collage 
boy, and he was my father.  I 
thought it was a legitimate 
business.  He was a politician, 
with fingers in a lot of pies.  I 
never saw the pies.  They had names.  
For the record.  Innocent names.
(he shrugs)
You know where that kind of money 
comes from, don't you?

BETTY
The money that makes you Mr. Clark 
Brandon.  Let's you live in a 
penthouse, on top of the Vancouver 
Royal.  Lets you own a cruiser.  
Lets you do as you please, go where 
you please.  You big, open-handed, 
generous guy.  That's the kind of 
money it takes, isn't it?

The PLANE NOISE is a little LOUDER.  Brandon looks up at 
it without much interest, then looks at Betty.

BRANDON
It buys things, just like any other 
kind.

BETTY
That man that was following us 
last night--he didn't come back 
this morning.  I'm beginning to 
wonder about him, too.  Was he 
really following me--or you?

BRANDON
No.  I paid him off.

BETTY
He'll come back...They always come 
back when you give them money.

BRANDON
Not this one.  And not Mitchell.

BETTY
(recoiling)
You-killed-him?

BRANDON
(with a twisted 
smile)
Magruder obliged me.  No use my 
saying it wasn't planned that way.  
I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb-
smart college boy anymore.
(he takes a deep 
breath)
Nobody in the world would believe 
I didn't plan the whole thing.

BETTY
I guess I'm a little screwy.  Maybe 
I could believe it.  Should I try?

BRANDON
Don't go soft on me, baby.  I've 
got your note in my pocket.  You 
wrote it, all by your own self.  
And I have to use it.  It has to 
be found in exactly the right place.

BETTY
So that I will never be found.

Brandon turns his head and stares full at her.  He swallows.  
He can't speak.

WIPE TO:

INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - I-BUREAU - PROJECTION ROOM -- 
NIGHT

The room is dark except for a strong white light over a 
desk.

In the background there is a projection screen and a 
comparison projector.  The police technician is bending 
over the desk looking at something through a magnifying 
glass, as Killaine enters.

KILLAINE
Got anything on the Goble case 
yet?

The Technician puts down a magnifying glass.

TECHNICIAN
Yes, I think so.  Here are two 
glazed manila envelopes.
(he holds them up)
One is the bag type.  The other 
one had the money in it.  Don't 
ask me how I know.  I know.

KILLAINE
I'm interested in who handled it.

TECHNICIAN
Four different people, Inspector.  
Three men and a women.  I've made 
slides for two.  They handled both 
envelopes.

He fits two slides into the projector and switches on the 
light.  Focuses a couple of separate images on the screen.  
One is a complete fingerprint, the other a portion such as 
would be made by a tip of a finger.

TECHNICIAN
Goble.  Second finger on left hand.  
On the left, the morgue print.  On 
the right, print lifted from the 
envelope.

He turns another knob and the two fingers draw together, 
overlap, and coincide, so that the incomplete image 
disappears altogether.

TECHNICIAN
No doubt about that one.

KILLAINE
How about Magruder?

TECHNICIAN
He checks too.

KILLAINE
That leaves two strangers.

TECHNICIAN
So far.

KILLAINE
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell 
case.

TECHNICIAN
(surprised)
Mayfield?  She fit into this?

KILLAINE
(deadpan)
She might.

Technician opens a file drawer and takes out a fingerprint 
card.  Lays it on the desk and picks up the magnifying 
glass.

TECHNICIAN
You'll have to take my word for 
it.  We don't make slides until we 
have perfect prints for comparison.

KILLAINE
I'll take your word.

The Technician places another card beside the one he took 
from the drawer, bends over, examines them through the 
magnifying glass, straightens up and shakes his head.

TECHNICIAN
Not a chance.  Whorl and plain 
arch. Different as salt and sand.

Killaine puts his hand in his pocket and takes out another 
fingerprint card.

KILLAINE
Try this one for the second 
stranger.

Technician takes the card, looks at it, pushes the other 
cards to one side.

TECHNICIAN
Gun permit, huh?
(he lines up two 
cards, studies 
them)
Another Whorl--man size.

He studies the prints a moment longer, then faces Killaine.

TECHNICIAN
This gun permit was issued to Clark 
Brandon?

KILLAINE
The card says so, doesn't it?

TECHNICIAN
Brandon handled the money envelope.

Killaine turns instantly, and starts out, CAMERA FOLLOWING 
As he opens the door, he meets Driscoll coming in.  Driscoll 
backs away, Killaine exits.

EXT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - I-BUREAU - CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

KILLAINE
What's the face for, Driscoll?

DRISCOLL
Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline 
injections, oxygen tent.  He may 
come out of it and he may not.  As 
a source of quick information, we 
can't forget him.

KILLAINE
We don't need him.

He opens door of I-Bureau.

KILLAINE
Go on in.  See what they've got.  
All I need now is a warrant and a 
pair of wings.

He goes out of SHOT quickly.  Driscoll looks after him, 
then starts into I-Bureau.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. COAST GUARD STATION - STEVENSTON, B.C. -- NIGHT

There is an armed guard at the entrance and a Canadian 
Coast Guard flag flies over the building.  A Vancouver 
police car drives up at high speed and squeals to a stop 
beside the sentry.  Killaine leans out of the window, shows 
the sentry his badge.

KILLAINE
Inspector Killaine.  Vancouver 
City Police.  Commander Goodwin's 
expecting me.

SENTY
Very good, sir.

He steps back.  The police car speeds on.

WIPE TO:

INT. COAST GUARD CONTROL ROOM -- NIGHT

Radio operator at set.

RADIO OPERATOR
(into mike)
C.G.L. at all cutters and patrol 
planes on station.  Vancouver Police 
Department bulletin.  Wanted for 
murder.  Clarke Brandon.  A 
naturalized Canadian citizen.  Age 
34-35.  Height six feet, one inch.  
Weight 190 pounds.  Muscular build.  
Dark hair.  American accent.  Now 
probably at sea in cabin cruiser 
Valkyrie.  Will probably attempt 
to cross International line under 
cover of darkness.

WIPE TO:

EXT. COAST GUARD CUTTER LYNX - AT BERTH -- NIGHT

Engines idling.  A rating stands by to cast off.  Killaine 
and a Coast Guard officer come rapidly down ramp, jump on 
board.  Rating casts off.  Lynx, a converted P.T. boat, 
without torpedo tubes, moves off from berth, picking up 
speed rapidly.

EXT. OPEN WATER - VALKYRIE -- NIGHT

Traveling at high speed in open water.

PLANE NOISE high overhead.

EXT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE - COCKPIT -- NIGHT

Brandon at wheel.  Betty pressed into corner of a seat 
watching him.  Spray drifts over them.

MED.  SHOT -- COAST GUARD PLANE IN FLIGHT

A converted Hudson bomber.

CLOSER ON THE PLANE

The pilot and co-pilot can be seen through the Plexiglas.  
They are searching the water below with their eyes.

INT. HUDSON BOMBER - COCKPIT -- NIGHT

SHOOTING PAST PILOT AND CO-PILOT

Pilot pushes the wheel forward and the plane goes into a 
steep dive.

REVERSE SHOT FROM PILOT'S ANGLE

WHAT HE SEES

The cabin cruiser is seen far below, moving fast through 
the water.  Or rather its wake is seen.  The cruiser itself, 
at this height, is almost invisible.

INT. HUDSON BOMBER - COCKPIT -- NIGHT

Betty is looking up at the plane.  Brandon reaches inside 
his coat.  His hand comes out with a heavy automatic, which 
we have seen before.

BRANDON
(tightly)
Get down in the cabin, Betty.

Her eyes go down.  She sees the gun, reacts.  A bitter 
smile moves her lips.

BETTY
Why?  To love ten minutes longer?  
And in the meantime, protect you?
(her voice becomes 
taunting)
Why don't you shoot me now and get 
it over with--

she looks up towards the PLANE NOISE.

BETTY
If you think you have the time.

REVERSE SHOT BEHIND BRANDON

A fog bank about a mile ahead.

BRANDON
(as if to himself)
Always some fog out here.

He looks up in the direction of the PLANE NOISE which is 
increasing.

BRANDON
There better be.

INT. HUDSON BOMBER - COCKPIT -- NIGHT

SHOT THROUGH THE PLEXIGLAS HEAD AND SHOULDERS OF THE PILOT 
AND Co-PILOT.

The cruiser down on the water is getting rapidly larger, 
but still cannot be seen who is in the cockpit, or even 
how may persons.  The co-pilot puts a pair of binoculars 
to his eyes.

EXT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE - COCKPIT -- NIGHT

Brandon with one hand on the wheel, the other holding the 
gun.  He is staring up towards the plane.  Betty is not in 
the cockpit.  Brandon turns towards where she was, reacts 
sharply, seeing she has disappeared.  An expression of 
frustration and despair shows on his face for a moment.  
The NOISE OF THE PLANE in the power dive becomes furiously 
LOUD.  Brandon's head goes around again.

REVERSE ANGLE -- THE PLANE DIVING DIRECTLY ON THE VALKYRIE

Brandon sees it.  It dives down almost into the CAMERA.

MED.  LONG SHOT -- FROM WATER LEVEL

The Valkyrie and the plane.  At the last moment, the plane 
pulls out of the dive, only thirty or forty feet above the 
Valkyrie, and goes into a climbing bank.

MED.  LONG SHOT - VALKYRIE - SHOOTING FROM BEHIND

The fog bank is dead ahead.  The coast Guard plane is 
climbing off to the left.  The Valkyrie reaches the fog 
bank, plunges into it, and becomes invisible.

INT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE - COCKPIT IN FOG -- NIGHT

Brandon is steering straight ahead.  He reaches to cut off 
the engines.  The Valkyrie slows down.  Betty's head emerges 
from the companionway.  Her eyes meet Brandon's.  Brandon 
is silent.

BETTY
You hoped I'd jumped overboard, 
didn't you?

Brandon does not answer, just stares at her.

BETTY
But I wouldn't make it that easy 
for you.

LONG SHOT - COAST GUARD CUTTER LYNX TRAVELING AT HIGH SPEED

CLOSE SHOT - BRIDGE OF LYNX

Coast Guard Lt. in command.  Killaine beside him, a talker 
with a head-set standing nearby.  He is receiving a message.

TALKER
(into his mouthpiece)
Bearing one-three-five.
(to Coast Guard 
officer)
Bearing one-three-five, sir.

Coast Guard officer nods.

COAST GUARD OFFICER
(to helmsman)
Get it?

HELMSMAN
One-three-five, sir.

He turns his wheel a little.  The Lynx changes course, 
heeling over.  Coast Guard officer puts binoculars to his 
eyes, wings them in a slow arc.  They come to a stop, fixed.

COAST GUARD OFFICER
(pointing)
There!

Killaine follows his pointing finger.

WHAT THEY SEE - LONG SHOT ACROSS OPEN EMPTY WATER - A FLARE 
HANGING IN THE SKY AND FALLING

As it falls, it is swallowed in a bank of fog.

EXT. BRIDGE OF CUTTER LYNX -- NIGHT

KILLAINE
(tensely)
Fog!

COAST GUARD OFFICER
We got a lot of it out here.

KILLAINE
Brandon will have counted on that.

COAST GUARD OFFICER
No doubt.  We have something he 
may not have counted on.

CUT TO:

EXT. CLOSE SHOT -- CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE IN FOG -- NIGHT

NOISE OF THE PLANE overhead, loud but diminishing.  Brandon 
sits listening, his hand on the wheel.

BETTY
(contempt in her 
voice now)
You'll never make it.  You've out-
smarted yourself.

BRANDON
(QUIETLY)
I'm still on course to Victoria.  
Nobody saw you get on board, nobody 
seen you since.

The Valkyrie has now stopped on the swell.  It rocks a 
little.  There are confused NOISES in the distance.  PLANE 
NOISE, possibly some other kind of ENGINE NOISE.  In the 
fog you can't tell what it is.

BETTY
You didn't leave the note.

Brandon puts the gun down close to his body, and pats his 
pocket.

BRANDON
It wasn't the time or place.  Don't 
worry about the note, baby.  I'm 
playing for my neck now.

BETTY
And I'm begging for my life--and 
yours.

BRANDON
(startled)
Mine?

BETTY
Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered 
anybody.  You killed Mitchell.  
Wasn't that an accident?  It must 
have been.  If you kill a 
blackmailer, you kill him dead--so 
that he can't talk anymore.

BRANDON
Mitchell was dead enough.

BETTY
And that nasty man that followed 
us last night.  You didn't kill 
him.

BRANDON
Who'd believe it but you?  I took 
him out to sea and threw him in 
the water.  Even if they find him, 
what connects him with me?

BETTY
Magruder does.

BRANDON
You think Magruder wants to hang 
beside me?

BETTY
But the next one is murder.  First 
the little step, then the longer 
step , and then the step you can 
never take back.  You could tell 
about Mitchell.  You could tell 
about Magruder--and the detective.  
It would hurt, but you could do 
it.  You could never tell about 
me.

BRANDON
Would I want to?

BETTY
Every day of your life you'll want 
me.  You'll never get over it.  
Every time you see your face in 
the mirror--

BRANDON
(with a sudden burst 
of fury)
Shut up!  Cut it out!  Even if I 
have to kill both of us--

He breaks off with a disgusted gesture.  A faint smile 
shows on Betty's lips.

CUT TO:

EXT. BRIDGE OF CUTTER LYNX -- NIGHT

Killaine and the Coast Guard officer are peering ahead 
into the thick fog.  The Lynx is just drifting.  The 
helmsman is standing on hand on the wheel.  The Coast Guard 
officer turns to the Talker.

COAST GUARD OFFICER
Nothing yet?

The Talker shakes his head, then:

TALKER
(SUDDENLY)
Just a minute, sir.  I believe--

RADAR SCREEN BELOW THE BRIDGE

A blob of light takes the form in one corner of it.  CAMERA 
PULLS BACK TO INCLUDE THE RADAR OPERATOR.  He reaches for 
a mike.

OPERATOR
(into mike)
Change course about five degrees 
south

After a moment the blob of light on the radar screen moves 
towards the center of the screen.

OPERATOR
(into mike)
Your dead on now.  Hold it there.

EXT. BRIDGE OF CUTTER LYNX -- NIGHT

The four MEN on it are now tensely staring straight ahead.

EXT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE - COCKPIT -- NIGHT

Brandon is listening again.  Far away there is a faint 
SOUND OF DIESEL ENGINES, but growing rapidly louder.  He 
stands up and twists his body, still holding the gun, looks 
back, then slips quickly behind the wheel again.

BRANDON
Radar.

He guns the motor and the cabin cruiser shoots forward 
into high speed.  Betty has to hang on.  He swings the 
cruiser around on another course and guns for it for all 
its worth for a moment or two, then abruptly cuts the motors 
again.  Cruiser slows down, once more drifts.  The ENGINE 
SOUND has now stopped.  Brandon turns to face Betty, who 
is now standing up.

BRANDON
This is it, Betty.  They'll find 
us again, fog or no fog.

BETTY
(speaking slowly, 
with difficulty)
If it has to be--do you mind if I 
do it myself?
(pause, then quickly)
Oh, I don't mean with the gun.  
This is no trick.  When I wrote 
that note you have in your pocket--
that was no trick either.  It's 
not so hard for me as you think.  
I'm not crying about it, I've been 
skating close to it for quite some 
time.  The water is cold down there--
(she gives a little 
shrug)
But so is everything else.  And 
there's you.

BRANDON
(startled)
Me?

BETTY
Yes.  You.  You're not really a 
murderer yet.

QUICK SHOT OF RADAR SCREEN

A Blob of light slides into it from another corner.

CUT TO:

EXT. BRIDGE OF CUTTER LYNX -- NIGHT

TALKER
(into his mouthpiece)
Bearing one-eight-one.
(to Coast Guard 
officer)
One-eight-one, sir.  Changed course 
due South.

OFFICER
(to helmsman)
One-eight-one..

HELMSMAN
One-eight-one, sir.

Helmsman swings the wheel around.  The Lynx veers, heeling 
over, comes level again.

OVERHEAD SHOT - DOWN ON LYNX (FROM HELICOPTER)

Following at an equal speed, then the Lynx gradually pulls 
away into the fog and disappears.  The NOISE OF ITS ENGINES 
is still heard for a few moments.

EXT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE - COCKPIT -- NIGHT

Still motionless on the water idling.  There is a SOUND OF 
THE CUTTER'S MOTORS, far off, but increasing.  Brandon is 
paying no attention.  He is staring at Betty.

BRANDON
(thickly)
I'm not a murderer yet, you said.  
Come here.  Come closer.  Let me 
look at you.

Betty holds off, then slowly comes towards him along the 
seat, until their faces close.  He searches her eyes.

BRANDON
(quietly)
I think you mean that.

BETTY
Do you think I was faking?

BRANDON
(thickly)
If I did-I don't-now.

He puts his arms around her, pulls her close.  There is 
kind of wonder in his eyes.  Hers stare back at him, calm 
and level.  He kisses her hard on the mouth, let's her go.  
She pulls away from him, along the seat.  She doesn't know 
what to think of him.  She is terrified, resigned, and at 
the same time, he still has an attraction for her.

BRANDON
The kiss of death.
(laughs)
With a new twist.

He lifts the gun in his hand, looks at it, tosses it 
overboard.  He reaches inside his coat, takes out the 
suicide note.

BRANDON
(reading)
"Dear Inspector Killaine.  This is 
goodbye.  You were right.  I had a 
secret."

The DIESEL ENGINE SOUND has grown louder.  Brandon looks 
up from the note.

BRANDON
A secret, Betty---as who hasn't

He crumples the note and envelope in his hand, drops them 
over the side of the boat.  Opens the engine full throttle 
and the power of the cruiser almost tears it out from under 
them.  Betty is thrown violently against the seat.  He 
reaches out and straightens her up.  There is a mad light 
in his eyes.  His face is no longer hard.

SERIES OF HELICOPTER SHOTS

Of the chase, alternating with the Cabin Cruiser and the 
Lynx, as the Lynx gradually closes in.  During these shots 
Cabin Cruiser and the Lynx both come out of the fog bank 
into moonlit water, but there is another fog bank half a 
mile or so ahead.

EXT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE - COCKPIT -- NIGHT

SHOT FROM BACK OF CRUISER

The Lynx is moving up fast, and the Coast Guard officer 
can be seen on the bridge, with binoculars to his eyes.  A 
rating, hanging on tight, is stripping the canvas off a 
twin machine gun mount.

BRANDON
(above the roar of 
the motors)
Stand up!  Let them take a good 
look at you.  Be sure they see 
you.  That fellow back there has 
night glasses.  Then jump---well 
out to the side.  Just as far as 
you can.

Betty does what he tells her.  She waves.  There is an 
answering wave from the bridge of the Lynx.  We can't see 
who's waving.  Betty sets herself to jump.  She tries to 
speak to Brandon, but nothing comes out.  There is a great 
deal of NOISE from motors.  Gravely, Brandon lifts his 
hand and salutes her.  She jumps.

FOLLOWING SHOT AS BETTY HITS THE WATER AND THE CRUISER 
PULLS AWAY RAPIDLY

Towards another fog bank beyond the clear space.

CUT TO:

EXT. BRIDGE OF CUTTER LYNX -- NIGHT

COAST GUARD OFFICER
Full speed astern.

TALKER
Full speed astern.

The cutter heaves on reversed engines, nearly stands on 
its tail in the water, drifts past Betty, comes to a stop, 
then moves forward slowly, swinging around to get close to 
her.

EXT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE - COCKPIT -- NIGHT

HIGH SHOT of Cabin Cruiser as it reaches the fog and plunges 
into it.  HELICOPTER WITH CAMERA plunges into fog at the 
same time.

EXT. COAST GUARD CUTTER LYNX -- NIGHT

CLOSE SHOT

Stopped on the swell.  Betty in the water, fighting her 
way towards it.  A life belt and rope are dropped neatly 
beside her.  She grabs it and is drawn towards the side of 
the lynx.  Coast Guard officer, Killaine, and a rating put 
rope ladder over the side.  Killaine starts down the rope 
ladder.

REVERSE SHOT -- DOWN FROM THE DECK OF THE LYNX

Past Killaine on the rope ladder to water, as Betty is 
pulled to foot of ladder.  Killaine reaches down, gets her 
hand.  She grasps rope ladder, Killaine helps her up onto 
it.  Business of getting her on board cutter.

EXT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE - COCKPIT -- NIGHT

Brandon staring straight ahead of him, gripping the wheel 
hard, giving the cruiser everything it has, driving as if 
he had a clear, open course.  HEARS A FOGHORN, somewhere 
of the fog.  Cocks his head, tries to gauge the direction.  
Turns the wheel a little.

EXT. COAST GUARD CUTTER LYNX - DECK -- NIGHT

As Betty comes over the side, Killaine holding her up, 
Betty is shivering with cold.  The rating hauls up the 
rope ladder and the life belt.  Coast Guard signals the 
bridge ad the Lynx starts moving ahead again.

COAST GUARD OFFICER
(to Betty)
Better get those wet clothes off 
in a hurry, Miss.  My cabin's at 
your disposal.

BETTY
Thank you.  Thank you very much.

He salutes, turns away, after giving a quick look at 
Killaine.

BETTY
(to Killaine)
He could have killed me a dozen 
times.  You'd never have known.

KILLAINE
We know everything.

BETTY
(almost passionately)
No, Jeff.  You don't.  He's not a 
murderer, I tell you.  He;s not a 
murderer.

KILLAINE
(same tone)
I hope he can prove it.  Come on.  
You don't want to get pneumonia.

He takes her arm, starts to push her along.  She is still 
shivering, but still determined to  defend Brandon.

BETTY
But I tell you---if you'd only 
understand.

KILLAINE
(gently)
I understand, Betty.  I understand 
perfectly.

He puts his arm around her.  Their eyes meet in a long 
look.

EXT. CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE - COCKPIT -- NIGHT

The cruiser is moving at high speed in the fog.  The FOG 
HORN SOUND is louder, but seems to come from all directions.  
Brandon is leaning forward, tensely, trying to see ahead.  
He turns the wheel first one way, and then another.  There 
is a sudden blast of the FOGHORN, very LOUD.

Brandon turns the wheel violently and the cruiser keels 
over.  But he is now quick enough.  Suddenly above looms 
the enormous bow of the Puget Sound Ferry, as big as an 
ocean liner.  It is ablaze with light.  CAMERA PANS UP to 
show it crashing down into the lens as it were.


THE CABIN CRUISER VALKYRIE

Thrown out of the water almost, it is up-ended on its stern.  
The ferry tears on through, filling the screen.

CUT TO:

EXT. A CORNER OF THE PASSENGER DECK ON THE FERRY -- NIGHT

A couple of PASSENGERS in overcoats leaning against the 
rail looking out into the fog.  One of them is lighting a 
cigarette, cupping his hands around the lighter.

FIRST PASSENGER
You always have this kind of weather 
up here?

SECOND PASSENGER
Certain times of the year.  Always 
a lot of fog.  But they never hit 
anything, somehow.

CUT TO:

EXT. BRIDGE ON THE FERRY -- NIGHT

At the end of the bridge an OFFICER is leaning down, staring 
towards the water.  He shakes his head, straightens up, 
turns away.

OFFICER
(speaking off)
An old packing case, I guess.

A BIG SEARCHLIGHT

Its beam is turned down on the water.  The beam moves a 
little, back towards the stern.  CAMERA FOLLOWS THE BEAM 
DOWN THROUGH THE FOG.  Empty water only is SEEN.  The 
searchlight is switched off.

WIPE TO:

DARK FOGGY SHOT CLOSE TO SURFACE OF WATER

A broken piece of the cabin cruiser's bow floats by, closer 
and closer to THE CAMERA, until on it the name VALKYRIE 
stands out, then it whirls past.  There is nothing left 
but the foggy surface of the Sound.

FADE OUT:

EXT. DESERT - DAWN

FULL SHOT. The sun, spinning up from behind the dark rim of 
eastern hills, is bleaching the cloudless, morning sky. This 
is volcanic country, barren, desolate, forbidding. There is 
no sign of life, no sound. Then on a distant hill, a man 
appears, to be followed by two others. They walk steadily 
forward.

DISSOLVE

EXT. NARROW CANYON - DAWN

MED. SHOT. A dry watercourse threads its way through the cut 
in the treeless hills. The sun is not high enough as yet to 
drive night from the canyon. A man appears around a bend; 
another and still another. They are McCall, Peters and Lednov, 
clad in prison clothes, hatless, their heads closely cropped. 
As Lednov's face comes into a closeup,

DISSOLVE

EXT. HILL - DAWN

LONG SHOT - DOWN ANGLE. A narrow valley lies below. Through 
it runs a cottonwood-bordered stream. Smoke curls up out of 
the trees. Horses graze in a small meadow near the creek. 
From O.O. comes the SOUND of heavy boots crunching across 
the dry, eroded earth. The three men file past camera to 
stop in the immediate F.g. and look down into the valley. 
They exchange glances and start down.

DISSOLVE

EXT. FORSTER CAMP - DAWN

MED. SHOT - ANGLED THROUGH willows. A bearded man, Cal 
Forster, and two young fellows in their late teens squat 
beside a campfire eating breakfast. O.s. there is the SOUND 
of movement. Lednov moves cautiously into the scene. He has 
a revolver in his hand.

Forster turns toward camera and fear comes into his 
expression. Lednov fires. Forster crumples near the fire. 
The two boys jump to their feet and reach for rifles. Lednov 
fires again and again. McCall and Peters come into the scene, 
both firing revolvers.

DISSOLVE

EXT. FORSTER CAMP - DAWN

MED SHOT - ANGLED ACROSS campfire. On the fire smoulders the 
prison clothes the convicts had worn. Smoke spirals up. In 
the B.B. Lednov, Peters and McCall, now wearing the clothes 
of the three Forsters, saddle the horses. CAMERA PANS AROUND 
and ANGLES DOWN. The bodies of Forster and his sons, now 
clad in underwear are sprawled by the fire. Forster's arm 
lies close to the smouldering clothing.

DISSOLVE

EXT. CREEK - DAWN

MED. LONG SHOT. Smoke climbs above the trees. Into the 
clearing ride the three convicts, to cross it and move 
westward. They disappear over the hill. A dust cloud marks 
their passage. CAMERA HOLDS ON the scene and over the shot 
comes the MAIN TITLE CARD:

ROUGHSHOD

EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

LONG SHOT. A buckboard drawn by two horses comes along the 
road. Graham, a middle-aged rancher, is driving. As the horses 
trot forward and dust rises above the road, the NEXT TITLE 
CARD is shown.

DISSOLVE

EXT. CREEK - DAY

LONG SHOT - DOWN ANGLE. Graham's buckboard moves down the 
road toward the clearing, as the TITLE CARDS follow and 
change. When the buckboard reaches the creek, the LAST TITLE 
CARD is ended.

EXT. MEADOW - DAY

MED. SHOT. Graham drives the horses through the creek and 
into the meadow. Through the trees the Forster camp can be 
seen. Graham glances over, then suddenly pulls on the reins. 
As the horses stop, he twists the reins around the whip stock, 
grabs his rifle from under the seat, leaps out and hurries 
forward toward the camp.

EXT. FORSTER CAMP - DAY

MED. SHOT. Graham hurries through the trees to stop in horror 
near the dead men. Then very slowly he moves forward to the 
smouldering fire. Stooping he lifts Forster's arm away from 
the fire, then picks up one of the prison coats and looks at 
it.

DISSOLVE

EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

MED. LONG SHOT. The surrounding hills are covered with scrub 
pinon pine and mesquite. Graham's buckboard, moving slowly 
up a hill, passes camera, which PANS WITH it. In the bed, 
covered by a tarp, are the three bodies. The narrow, one-way 
road climbs easily up the gentle hill. Beyond, a dust cloud 
rises. As Graham's buckboard nears the crest, a surrey appears 
and starts down. Graham pulls his team into the bank, trying 
to make room for the surrey.

MED. SHOT

There are four women in the two-seated surrey, which is 
heavily loaded with trunks, hatboxes, etc. Mary Wells, the 
loveliest of the four, is driving. She is more poised, more 
self-assured than the others. Her clothes, though a trifle 
showy, are attractive. She wears a large spectacular hat. 
Helen Carter, showier, harder and more cynical, sits beside 
her. In the seat behind are Marcia Paine, placid, younger 
looking than her years, and Elaine Ross, a striking blonde 
with a pale haunted face. Elaine is obviously ill. Mary is 
riding the brake and holding the team back.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SHOOTING PAST Graham.

GRAHAM
(annoyed)
What in thunderation --
(calling)
Wait a minute -- stop --

He jerks on the reins and tries to make room for the surrey. 
A steep bank is on camera left. On camera right, the road 
drops off into a gulley. As the surrey comes up Mary reins 
the team in. The women all look frightened. Graham, trying 
to force his team to pull the vehicle up the bank, is too 
occupied to recognize the women at once. Having made just 
enough room for the surrey, he turns and looks at the women.

GRAHAM
All right --
(then surprised)
What are you girls doin' way out 
here?

Mary looks ahead at the narrow road and the canyon to her 
left.

MARY
Until you came along we were going 
to Sonora.

GRAHAM
What do you know about that. Did you 
sell your place?

MARY
(dryly)
Not exactly. They decided gambling 
and dancing were bad for people.
(pointing)
Can I make it?

GRAHAM
Depends on how good you drive.

HELEN
She's a little out of practice.

Graham jumps over the wheel.

MED. CLOSE ON SURREY

Graham reaches the surrey.

GRAHAM
(cheerfully)
Slide over.

HELEN
(getting up)
I'm slidin' all the way over.

She climbs out. Marcia looks at the narrow space ahead.

MARCIA
(rising)
So am I. Come on Elaine.

Elaine leans back against the cushions and shakes her head.

ELAINE
(flat)
What's the difference if we fall in 
the canyon.

MARCIA
Don't talk like that.

Helen is out on the road now. Mary has moved over and Graham 
picks up the reins. Marcia gives up and jumps out.

GRAHAM
Nothin' to it --

He releases the brake.

GRAHAM
-- once you know how. Trouble is, 
never was a woman knew how to handle 
a team. Shouldn't let 'em loose on 
the roads. No disrespect meant, Miss 
Wells.

Mary isn't listening. She is looking at the road. Elaine 
closes her eyes. Helen and Marcia scurry back out of the 
way.

GRAHAM
Get up.

Adroitly he drives the surrey past.

ANOTHER ANGLE

featuring buckboard. Helen and Marcia start along the road 
past the buckboard. Helen stops and looks at its cargo in 
horror. She grabs Marcia's arm. The girls look at each other 
and hurry after the surrey which has stopped below the 
buckboard.

MED. SHOT

on surrey. Graham jumps out.

GRAHAM
There you are. Now take it easy and 
you'll be all right.

MARY
Thank you, Mr. Graham.

Helen and Marcia hurry up. Marcia motions back.

MARCIA
(aghast)
There's -- dead men -- in your wagon!

GRAHAM
That's right. You had me so busy I 
forgot --
(worried)
Come to think of it you better turn 
around and drive right back to Aspen.

The women exchange glances. Elaine is sitting up, her eyes 
open.

GRAHAM
They were murdered. I found the bodies 
on Alder Crick, northeast of here. 
Like I said if I was you, I'd go 
back, because the men who killed 
them might be on this road.

ELAINE
(bitterly)
Back to what?

GRAHAM
Why, back to Aspen, where you came 
from.

As Mary speaks, Helen pushes Marcia into the surrey and climbs 
up beside Mary.

MARY
Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. 
They threw us out.

GRAHAM
(distressed)
They shouldn't have done that.

MARY
We tried to point that out. But there 
were some pretty nosey citizens who 
wouldn't listen to reason. They said 
Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right 
to play poker in your own home but 
not in a saloon.

GRAHAM
(sadly)
I knew something would happen when 
they started puttin' up fences and 
passin' laws.

Mary unwraps the reins from the whipstock.

MARY
Goodbye and thanks.

GRAHAM
I don't like to see you go.

Mary releases the brake and the surrey starts rolling forward.

GRAHAM
But that's the way it is. The live 
ones go out and the dead ones come 
in.

The surrey starts down the hill. Graham looks after it, then 
turns to go back to the buckboard, CAMERA PANNING WITH him.

DISSOLVE

EXT. ASPEN - DAY - (MATTE SHOT)

The town lies in a lush green valley. It is surrounded by 
meadowland and shaded by cottonwoods, alders and aspen. In 
the F.g. Graham's buckboard moves fast down hill.

DISSOLVE OUT

EXT. ASPEN STREET - DAY DISSOLVE IN

FULL SHOT. In the F.g. a smallish crowd, mostly men and 
children idle in the street in front of Mary Wells' Gambling 
and Dance Hall. The wooden sidewalk is cluttered with those 
articles belonging to the women that were too bulky to get 
into the surrey. Several women stand on the porch supervising 
the locking up of the place and the removal of the sign of 
Mary Wells' name on it. Graham's buckboard rounds a corner 
at a fast trot. He slows the team to let the people get out 
of the way.

MED. SHOT ON BUCKBOARD

The team has slowed to a walk. The people give their attention 
to the buckboard. A boy clambers up over the tailboard, sees 
the cargo and jumps off with a frightened yell. The crowd 
turns from the dance hall and follows the buckboard leaving 
the women and their pious male assistants on the porch.

EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

MED. FULL SHOT - ANGLED to include blacksmith shop across 
the street. Far down the street comes Graham's buckboard 
followed by the small crowd. The sheriff's office is a one-
story wooden structure. Next to it is the general store. In 
front of the blacksmith shop stands a wagon with one wheel 
off. In the corral alongside are eleven blooded mares. Clay 
Phillips, his brother Steve and the blacksmith are inside 
the shop. Clay's saddle horse is tethered to the hitching 
rail beside two harnessed work horses.

INT. BLACKSMITH SHOP - DAY

ANGLED to include sheriff's office. The blacksmith, Sam Ellis, 
an elderly bent man in a leather apron stands at the forge 
in which he is heating the rim from the big wheel which lies 
on the table nearby. Clay, a long-legged wrangler in clean 
but faded work clothes stands near the forge pumping the 
bellows and watching his brother, a freckled kid of sixteen 
trying to roll a cigarette. Steve has progressed to the most 
difficult step, that of licking and sealing the paper. Clay 
reaches over and takes it from him. He puts the skinny 
cylinder in his mouth and Steve lights it for him. The first 
third of the cigarette burns with one quick flare.

STEVE
How does she draw?

CLAY
A little hot.

Sam lifts the rim to the wheel.

SAM
You want to get out of here before 
noon, maybe you should lend me a 
hand.

Clay, the cigarette dangling from his lips, moves over to 
the table, picks up a hammer and helps Sam hammer the rim on 
the wheel. Steve stands watching.

CLAY
Rate you're goin', we'll be here 
until winter.

Together they lift the wheel and plunge it into the tub of 
water. Steam rises to fill the blackened shed.

SAM
(amiably grumbling)
Account of you, I miss out on the 
only excitement Aspen's had for 
months.

CLAY
You're too old to watch such goin's 
on.

STEVE
And I'm too young.

Clay and Sam spin the wheel in the tub.

CLAY
That's right.

STEVE
I don't see no sense to makin' people 
leave town if they don't want to 
leave.

SAM
I don't either -- when people are 
that good-lookin'. Maybe that's why -- 
they were too good-lookin'.
(philosophically)
But there'll be others along to take 
their place after a while when this 
quiets down. And everything will be 
fine until some busybody starts 
stirring up trouble.

CLAY
(mildly)
Don't you ever run down?

SAM
(to Steve)
Some people just have to run other 
people's lives. Now take Clay. You 
want to amble up the street and see 
the fun and what does he say?

CLAY
(good-natured)
You stick to your blacksmithin' and 
let me take care of Steve.

From O.s. comes the SOUND of the approaching buckboard and 
crowd. Steve hears the noise and moves to the front of the 
shed.

EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

MED. FULL SHOT - Steve's angle. Graham pulls his buckboard 
up, jumps out and hurries into the sheriff's office. Some 
kids run up to stand on the porch chattering excitedly. 
Members of the crowd straggle up.

INT. BLACKSMITH SHOP - DAY

ANGLED PAST Steve. Clay comes up to stand beside Steve. Sam 
joins them. Steve looks up at Clay hopefully.

CLAY
We'll both take a look. Anything's 
better than listenin' to Sam.
(to Sam)
Don't forget to shoe the mule.

Clay and Steve exit. Sam looks after them, shrugs disgustedly 
and goes back to the wheel.

EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

MED. SHOT - featuring buckboard. The crowd around the wagon 
stands in shocked silence looking at the bodies under the 
tarp. Clay and steve come up, glance in the buckboard and 
then at each other. Clay speaks to a man near him.

CLAY
Who are they?

MAN
Don't know. Graham brought 'em in.

The sheriff calls from O.s.

GARDNER'S VOICE
Clay, come up here a minute.

ANOTHER ANGLE FEATURING PORCH

Sheriff Gardner, who has seen Clay through the window, comes 
out of his office on to the porch followed by Jeb Graham and 
a young deputy. In his hand Gardner holds the burned prison 
jacket. Clay goes up the steps to the porch. Steve follows 
to the foot of the steps to stand watching. The crowd around 
the wagon gives its attention to the men on the porch.

MED. SHOT

Gardner is neatly dressed with his star hidden under his 
coat. His deputy wears jeans, shirt, and leather jacket.

CLAY
Hello Graham -- Joe -- Mr. Gardner.

GARDNER
Graham's got something to tell you 
might interest you.

GRAHAM
(motioning toward 
wagon)
Cal Forster and his sons. Somebody 
killed 'em.

He pauses to let that sink in.

GRAHAM
You know that cottonwood grove on 
Alder Crick? They must have been 
eatin' breakfast the way it looked, 
sittin' by the fire eatin' breakfast 
and when I got there nothin' but 
them lyin' dead in their underdrawers. 
No horses or guns or grub.

CLAY
(shocked)
Forster never did anyone any harm.
(puzzled)
But what's that got to do with me? I 
came into town from the south.

Gardner holds out the burned jacket.

GARDNER
This was smoulderin' on the fire.

Clay moves over to glance down at the jacket.

CLAY
I still don't see.

From his pocket, Gardner takes several communications, thumbs 
through them and passes one over. It is a telegram, of the 
period.

GARDNER
I got it day before yesterday.

Clay reads it.

INSERT TELEGRAM OF THE PERIOD:

SHERIFF GARDNER: ASPEN, NEV. 
BE ADVISED OF ESCAPE OF LEDNOV, PETERS AND McCALL CONVICTED 
MURDERERS SERVING LIFE TERMS. 
BELIEVED HEADED FOR CALIFORNIA.

L.B. GROVE, WARDEN STATE PENITENTIARY NORTON, NEV.

BACK TO SCENE. Clay hands the telegram back.

GARDNER
Now are you interested?

Clay nods.

GARDNER
You should be. Maybe Lednov heard 
about that Sonora ranch of yours.

CLAY
Maybe he did.

GARDNER
We're going to look for him. Want to 
come along?

CLAY
I've got eleven horses to get over 
the mountains before snow catches me 
and covers the feed.

GARDNER
(dryly)
And that's more important than finding 
Lednov?

CLAY
Like you said, maybe he knows where 
my ranch is. If he does, he'll be 
waiting on the porch.

He turns toward the steps.

GARDNER
(with irony)
I'll drop the sheriff in Sonora a 
line to sort of look around for him.

Clay speaks over his shoulder as he goes down.

CLAY
Thanks.

ANOTHER ANGLE

As Clay starts away, Steve follows him. Clay doesn't cross 
to the blacksmith shop. He goes along the sidewalk toward 
the general store. Steve hurries to catch up with him.

EXT. STREET - DAY

MOVING SHOT. Clay, deep in thought, seems unaware of his 
brother at his side.

STEVE
Who's Lednov?

CLAY
A man I used to know.

They walk in silence to the General store and Clay goes up 
the steps and across the porch. Steve follows close behind.

FULL SHOT

The store is a typical general store of the period, selling 
everything from buggies to baby clothes. In one corner is 
the postoffice. The storekeeper, Hayes, is unpacking a case 
of canned goods, stacking the cans on the shelf. Clay, 
followed by Steve, enters. Hayes glances over.

MED. SHOT

Clay crosses to the shelf where the rifle and shotgun shells 
are kept and takes down a half dozen boxes of 30 30 
cartridges.

HAYES
Forget somethin', Clay?

CLAY
Shells. How much for six boxes?

HAYES
Six times six bits. But wait until I 
finish this.

Besides Clay, Steve is inspecting a rack of guns.

STEVE
You might tell a fellow things, 
'specially if the fellow's your 
brother, seems to me.

CLAY
Like what?

Steve picks up a rifle, puts it to his shoulder and squints 
along the barrel.

STEVE
Like why you're buyin' a whole slew 
of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.

CLAY
I don't want to run short.

STEVE
You never said this Lednov's name 
before, that I can remember.

CLAY
No call to. That jail looked pretty 
solid to me.
(pointing to rifle)
How's she feel?

STEVE
Nice.

He pulls the hammer back and snaps the trigger. Hayes comes 
across and takes the gun from him.

HAYES
You know bettern' to do that, Steve. 
Unless you're figurin' on buyin' it.

CLAY
One he's got, more his size.

STEVE
But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's 
no good for real huntin'. You shoot 
a man with a 22 and where are you?

CLAY
The thing to do is stick to rabbits.

He hands Hayes some money for the shells. Hayes crosses to 
another part of the store to get change. Clay and Steve, who 
has picked up the rifle again, move over to the counter.

ANOTHER ANGLE

STEVE
What was he in jail for?

CLAY
You sure worry that bone. He killed 
a fellow.

STEVE
In a fight?

CLAY
The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.

STEVE
This is an awful nice gun.
(sighting it)
Certainly come in handy when there's 
men around who shoot people that 
aren't lookin'.

Clay grins. Hayes comes up with the change. Clay takes out 
some bills and gives them to the storekeeper.

CLAY
(points to rifle)
I may as well buy it for him. 
Otherwise he'll be crying all the 
way over the hill.

Steve's expression shows his gratitude and delight. He covers 
up with banter.

STEVE
You must be plenty worried about 
Lednov sneakin' up on us.
(hopefully)
Think he will?

CLAY
Yes.

STEVE
At the ranch maybe?

CLAY
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner 
than that.

STEVE
(annoyed)
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? 
I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' 
with you. Remember?

CLAY
(smiling)
All right. I'll tell you.

He puts one of the boxes of shells on the end of the counter.

MED. CLOSE - DOWN ANGLE

CLAY
Let's say this is the penitentiary.

He reaches down into one of the barrels in front of the 
counter. The barrels are filled with beans, nails, dried 
apples, hardtack, etc. Clay takes a handful of beans and 
makes a trail ending in a little pile.

CLAY
Here's Alder Crick.

He puts another box of shells on the other side of the 
counter.

CLAY
And here we are in Aspen.

He runs a trail of beans away from "Aspen" toward the end of 
the counter. He runs another trail from "Alder Crick" to 
cross the Aspen trail. He puts another box of shells on the 
far end of the counter.

CLAY
That's Sonora.

He reaches down without looking and brings up a hardtack.

CLAY
motioning) Lednov gets out of jail 
and comes along here to Alder Crick. 
Then goes along here toward the Sonora 
road.

Clay drops the hardtack back from where the bean trails cross.

CLAY
That's Lednov!
(tracing)
We come along here.

STEVE
(pointing)
And meet him there.

CLAY
Unless the sheriff gets too close 
and he holes up.

He holds out his hand and Hayes hands him his change.

CLAY
So let's go.

Steve tucks his gun under his arm. As he passes the counter, 
he picks up the hardtack and starts eating it.

EXT. GENERAL STORE

MED. SHOT - ANGLED TOWARD Sheriff's office. Up the street 
men are gathering around the sheriff's office. Some are 
mounted. Some are tightening their cinches. Clay and Steve 
come out of the store to look up the street. Steve munches 
the hardtack.

STEVE
(motioning)
Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.

CLAY
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' 
for one man. Me.

STEVE
Why?

CLAY
He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?

STEVE
Lednov.

He glances at the remaining piece of hardtack and then pitches 
it away.

STEVE
I don't like him.

Clay laughs. As they start up the street, the sheriff mounts 
his horse and, followed by his men, rides forward.

DISSOLVE

EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

CLOSE SHOT. A woman's hat lies on the rocky earth. It is a 
big, elaborate affair. O.s. there is the SOUND of hoofbeats, 
the SQUEAL of a wagon brake and the JANGLE of harness. CAMERA 
PULLS BACK and ANGLE WIDENS to reveal Clay's wagon coming 
down a very steep hill. Steve is driving, holding tightly to 
the reins and riding the brake. Seeing the hat, he yells to 
Clay.

STEVE
Another one, Clay.

Clay rides over and, swinging down, picks it up.

MED. SHOT

ANGLED DOWN hill. The road twists tortuously down. Near the 
bottom it swings sharply at right angles into a dry wash. 
The banks shut out further view of the road. Near where the 
road turns a trunk lies at the side. It has broken open and 
some of the contents are spilled out in the dust. Clay rides 
to it, reins in his horse and looks down. Steve, with 
difficulty, pulls the mules to a stop alongside.

ANOTHER ANGLE

featuring trunk and wagon. Clay swings out of his saddle, 
starts tossing the clothes back in the trunk. Steve jumps 
down.

STEVE
They sure must have been travelin'. 
This keeps up we can start a store.

CLAY
Things get tough next winter, you'll 
have somethin' to wear.

Steve holds up a petticoat close to his body and grins.

STEVE
I'd look good doin' the ploughin' in 
this.

Clay takes it from him, puts it in the trunk and shuts the 
lid. Steve helps him hoist the trunk into the wagon bed. 
Steve gets back in the seat. Just as Clay is about to mount, 
he stops and picks up a small folding daguerrotype case 
delicately ornamented. He lifts his eyebrow, tucks the case 
into his pocket, then mounts and starts ahead around the 
bend.

MED. LONG SHOT

Clay's ANGLE. Ahead, off the road in the wash is the surrey 
that passed Graham's buckboard at the fork. Clay spurs his 
horse forward.

MED. SHOT

on surrey. The back wheel is broken and the bed of the surrey 
rests on the ground. The horses have been taken from the 
traces and stand dejectedly in the hot sun. A blanket is 
spread in the scant shade thrown by the surrey. On it lies 
Elaine and, sitting beside her, is Marcia. A damp cloth is 
spread across Elaine's forehead. A water bag hangs from the 
surrey. Elaine's head is pillowed on a dainty satin cushion. 
Helen and Mary have risen at Clay's approach and now stand 
by the road.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Clay gallops forward to pull up near the surrey. In the b.g. 
Steve drives the wagon around the bend. Clay dismounts.

MED. GROUP SHOT

Clay drops his reins and hurries up.

CLAY
Anybody hurt?

MARY
No. We came down the hill a little 
fast and...
(rueful)
...the wheel broke.
(hopefully)
Can you fix it for us?

Clay bends over Elaine.

CLAY
What's the matter with her?

MARY
(dryly)
Too much excitement. How about the 
surrey. Can you fix it?

Clay turns from Elaine and gives his attention to the surrey.

ANOTHER ANGLE

on rear of surrey. In the B.g. Steve pulls the wagon to a 
stop, jumps off, and comes running over.

STEVE
Jimininy. You sure were lucky, just 
bustin' a wheel.

Helen moves toward Clay. She miles without humor.

HELEN
(rubbing thigh)
You think that'sall we busted -- You 
should see...

Clay stops her with a look, goes around, and kicks the 
unbroken back wheel. The spokes rattle.

CLAY
This must have been in the family a 
long time.

MARY
(dryly)
It was a gift from the citizens of 
Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.

She looks at him to see if the name registers.

MARY
And this is Helen Carter.

CLAY
I'm Clay Phillips.
(motioning)
My brother Steve.

Steve tugs at his battered hat.

STEVE
(shy)
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
(brightly)
We found your trunk. Were you doin' 
the driven'?

MARY
I was at first. Then I was hanging 
on.
(to Clay)
Are you going far?

CLAY
Yes, ma'am.

MARY
As far as -- Sonora?

CLAY
Just about.

Mary and Helen exchange glances.

MARY
We're going to Sonora, too, so that 
solves everything.

Clay takes the makings from his pocket, starts to roll a 
cigarette.

MARY
We can ride in your wagon.

Steve looks at Clay hopefully. He likes the prospect of having 
these lovely women along.

MARY
We wouldn't think of asking you to 
take us for nothing.

Clay finishes the cigarette, starts to put the makings back. 
Mary holds out her hand. Clay gives her the makings. Mary 
speaks as she casually rolls a cigarette.

MARY
There's only four of us.

Clay motions to the remuda that grazes in the b.g.

CLAY
I've got eleven horses.

STEVE
(proudly)
Morgan blood. The beat in Nevada. 
Clay and me have a place on the 
Toulomne River. We're going to raise 
horses like these.

Mary has finished rolling her cigarette. She passes the bag 
to Helen, who starts rolling one.

MARY
They won't be riding in the wagon.

CLAY
(dryly)
Did you ever try taking a bunch of 
horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite 
a job.

MARY
You can't leave us here.

CLAY
Course I can't. I'll give you a lift 
to the first ranch.

Helen has finished her cigarette. She passes the makings to 
Steve. He hesitates, looks at his brother and, when he sees 
Clay is occupied with Mary, starts rolling one.

MARY
What good is it going to do us to go 
to some ranch?

CLAY
(amiably)
You can stay here if you like.

MARY
We have to get to Sonora. There are 
jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay 
you for your trouble.

CLAY
I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, 
and I can't take a chance on losing 
the horses.

Steve finishes his cigarette. Again he hesitates, then not 
wanting to seem young in front of these women he takes a 
bold step and lights it. Clay reaches over and takes it from 
him. Mary watches the byplay.

CLAY
When you're old enough to smoke, 
I'll tell you.
(kind)
Get the horses started on ahead, 
will you, Steve?

Steve, embarrassed and hurt, turns quickly away. Helen looks 
after the boy.

HELEN
Afraid it will stop him growin'?

CLAY
(turning)
Let's get your stuff in the wagon. 
Like I said, I'll take you to the 
first ranch. I wish I could carry 
you all the way, but I can't. It's a 
tough trip and women would be in the 
way.

MARY
(dryly)
Our kind of women?

CLAY
(ignores that)
You'll have to drive -- except down 
hill.

He lifts some things out of the surrey and carries them toward 
the wagon.

HELEN
Maybe you're going about this all 
wrong. Why not try telling him we'll 
do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' 
for him. That usually works.
(then shocked at the 
thought)
Yeah, but suppose he took us up on 
it. Where would we be?

MARY
Maybe in Sonora.

She starts around the surrey. Helen follows.

Clay bends over Elaine.

CLAY
What's the matter with her?

MARY
(dryly)
Too much excitement. Or maybe it's 
just the heat. How about the surrey. 
Can you fix it?

As Clay turns from Elaine, Marcia joins the other two, their 
attention on Clay and the surrey. Left alone, Elaine is 
suddenly alert and no longer sick. She glances around, then 
unobserved slides out from under the shade of the surrey.

ANOTHER ANGLE

on rear of surrey. In the B.g. Steve pulls the wagon to a 
stop, jumps off, and comes running over. Elaine stands for a 
moment, searching the ground with her eyes.

STEVE
Jiminy. You sure were lucky, just 
bustin' a wheel.

Helen moves toward Clay. She smiles without humor. With this 
new diversion, Elaine, still unnoticed, starts away -- back 
toward where they dropped the trunk.

HELEN
(rubbing thigh)
You think that's all we busted -- 
You should see...

MARY
(sees Elaine)
Now where's she goin'? --

ELAINE
(half-turns without 
stopping)
I -- lost something.

CLAY
It wouldn't happen to be this...

Elaine stops now and turns as Clay takes the folding 
daguerrotype case from his pocket. Elaine, her eyes wide and 
frightened, starts back as Mary takes the case from Clay and 
opens it.

MARY
Who's the old folks?

ELAINE
(frantic)
Give it to me!

She jerks the case from Mary's hands, snaps it shut, and 
stands staring at Mary with a strange mixture of fright, 
anger and hysteria. Mary glances around as if to say what-
did-I-do? To cover the embarrassed silence, Clay kicks the 
unbroken back wheel. The spokes rattle.

CLAY
This must have been in the family a 
long time.

Elaine glances at him as though he had insulted her, turns 
and starts toward the blanket again.

MARY
(dryly)
It was a gift from the citizens of 
Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.

She looks at him to see if the name registers. At the surrey 
side, Elaine is abruptly weak again. She leans against it 
for support. Mareia moves to her as she slides back down on 
the blanket, clutching the case.

MARY
And this is Helen Carter.

CLAY
I'm Clay Phillips.
(motioning)
My brother Steve.

Steve tugs at his battered hat.

STEVE
(shy)
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
(brightly)
We found your trunk. Were you doin' 
the drivin'?

ANOTHER ANGLE

Mary and Helen come around the end of the surrey to where 
Elaine lies. Mary bends beside the sick girl and lifts the 
cloth from the girl's forehead.

MARY
Come on, Honeybunch. We're changing 
trains.

The sick girl sits up. She looks around her dully.

MARY
A nice, kind wrangler is letting us 
ride in his wagon...

Assisted by Mary, Elaine gets to her feet. Mary puts her arm 
around her.

MARY
...as far as the first ranch. From 
then on --

Elaine stops. She looks fearfully up at Helen.

ELAINE
What ranch?

MARY
What's the difference?

She tries to lead the girl toward the wagon.

ELAINE
(fierce)
Ask him what ranch --

MARY
There's plenty of time for that.
(sharp)
Come on, now. You've got to lie down 
out of this sun. Stop worrying. I'll 
find out what ranch after a while.

She pulls the girl with her toward the wagon.

MED. SHOT

on wagon. Clay, in the wagon bed, is stowing his gear in the 
back. Mary, supporting Elaine, reaches the wagon. Seeing the 
girls, Clay reaches down and gently lifts Elaine up. Mary 
climbs in beside him.

MED. CLOSE

wagon bed. Clay has unrolled a bedroll under the seat where 
there is a little shade.

CLAY
(kind)
Stretch out under the seat, Miss.

ELAINE
(desperate)
Which ranch?

CLAY
How's that?

MARY
She's worried about where you're 
taking us.

As she speaks, Mary helps the girl down under the seat, then 
rises to face Clay.

MARY
(dryly)
So am I.

CLAY
It's a nice place owned by an old 
couple named Wyatt.

CLOSE SHOT

Elaine as she hears the name. She is shocked.

CLAY'S VOICE
They'll take you in until you can 
make other arrangements.

TWO SHOT

Clay and Mary. Clay vaults out of the wagon, CAMERA ANGLE 
WIDENS, he looks up.

CLAY
So both of you stop worrying.

He turns away and hurries back to the surrey.

DISSOLVE

EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

FULL SHOT. Dust rises over the road as the cavalcade moves 
forward. Clay, rifle across his lap, rides in front. The 
wagon, with Mary driving and Helen beside her on the seat, 
follows. The two horses that pulled the surrey are tied to 
the tail gate. Then comes the remuda with Steve bringing up 
the rear.

CLOSE SHOT

Marcia and Elaine. PROCESS. Marcia sits in the bed of the 
wagon looking back. Elaine lies under the seat.

CLOSE SHOT

Steve. Steve proudly carries his new rifle across his lap. 
He whistles happily as he scans the desert country hopefully 
for the enemy.

EXT. CAMP SITE - LATE AFTERNOON

FULL SHOT. Long shadows of the hills lie on the grassy meadow 
along the stream that is bordered by cottonwoods and willows. 
A knoll overlooks the camp site. The caravan can be seen as 
it halts in the lush grass a few yards from the stream. The 
girls sit lifelessly on the wagon; they seem too tired to 
dismount. Then, finally, Marcia helps Elaine to climb stiffly 
down. With the exception of Mary they all let themselves 
down in the grass. Mary walks to the head of the team and 
starts fumbling with the harness. Steve comes into the scene, 
dismounts quickly and pulls the saddle off his horse. The 
remuda has fanned out, the horses moving toward the water. 
Steve crosses to Mary and takes over the job of unbuckling 
the harness. Mary smiles gratefully and rubs her hand across 
her face.

CLAY'S VOICE
Steve, see the horses don't drink 
too much --

Steve straightens, looks towards the horses and moves off. 
He speaks to Mary over his shoulder.

STEVE
Leave that unharnessing for me, Ma'am.

Mary smiles after him, then moves across the grass, CAMERA 
DOLLYING AHEAD of her. She sinks to her knees in the patch 
of sand by the stream and leans down and puts her face under 
the water. Then, sitting up, she wipes the water and dust 
from her face with a handkerchief. Clay rides up from behind, 
dismounts, scoops up some water from the river in the brim 
of his hat and drinks it. For a second he watches Mary.

CLAY
There's a place down a ways, where 
you and the girls can wash some of 
that dust off.

Mary's manner is business-like. She and the girls are along 
for the ride. She wants no favors -- wants to do her part.

MARY
Thanks. And isn't there something we 
can do about supper -- or making the 
beds?

CLAY
(half-smile)
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a 
pillow and roll up in a tarp.

MARY
(curt)
But you eat, don't you?

CLAY
Mostly, we open a can of beans and 
boil some coffee.

MARY
Where do you keep the can opener?

CLAY
In the grub box.
(softening)
Toward morning the dew gets kind of 
heavy so maybe you better fix up a 
bed under the wagon. Spread some 
bunch grass under the tarp and the 
ground won't be so hard.

He turns and leads his horse back to the wagon, stands there 
unsaddling it. Mary rises.

MARY
Marcia -- all of you. Come on.

She starts downstream.

MED. SHOT

ANGLED PAST wagon. Clay tosses the saddle into the wagon 
bed, slaps his mare on the rump. She trots off. Climbing up 
on the wheel, he gets the grub box under the seat and lifts 
it down. Steve comes from out of scene and starts unharnessing 
the team.

STEVE
(trying to be casual)
Where'd they go?

CLAY
Swimming.

Clay comes past him, carrying the grub box. He puts it down 
near where some stones make a crude firebox.

STEVE
It's sort of nice having company 
along. Not so lonesome.

Clay squats by the stones and starts building a fire.

CLAY
When you get the team watered, rustle 
up some wood.

He fans the small flame with his hat. Steve leads the mules 
down toward the stream.

MED. SHOT

ANGLED PAST Clay. In the B.g. Steve stands by the stream, 
letting the team drink. O.s. the women can be heard laughing 
and splashing. Steve gives all his attention to what is going 
on downstream. Clay puts wood on the fire, opens the grub 
box. He sees Steve, takes the coffee pot out of the box and 
heads for the stream.

MED. LONG SHOT

ANGLED PAST Steve downstream. Behind the willows the girls 
are bathing. However they are too far away to be seen clearly 
and the willows make a fairly effective screen. Clay walks 
upstream and fills the coffee pot, then comes back to stand 
for a moment beside Steve. Steve, who hadn't seen Clay until 
now, suddenly gets very busy giving all his attention to the 
mules.

STEVE
(to mules)
You boys have had enough.

He jerks them from the water and leads them away. Clay frowns 
after him, then goes back to the wagon.

MED. SHOT

on wagon and fire. As Clay passes the wagon, he reaches into 
the bed and gets a couple of strips of scrap iron. These he 
carries to the fire. He puts the iron strips across the blaze, 
sets the coffee pot on, feeds the fire with some more wood, 
then going back to the wagon, he takes his rifle out, throws 
a shell into the chamber and starts off up the knoll.

DISSOLVE

EXT. KNOLL - NIGHT

MED. SHOT. It is a moonlight night. Clay squats on his heels, 
smoking. The rifle lies across his knees. Below can be seen 
the campfire, and the shadowy forms of the girls as with 
Steve's help they make up a bed under the wagon and cook the 
evening meal. Clay suddenly reacts as O.s. a horse whinnies. 
Standing he looks off into the darkness.

LONG SHOT

ANGLED PAST Clay. In the moonlight the trail stretches back 
over rolling hills. Faintly can be heard the SOUND of 
hoofbeats. Below, where the remuda grazes, a horse whinnies 
again. Clay moves down toward the camp.

MED. SHOT

the camp. As Clay approaches. Steve squats by the fire. He 
has spread out a tarp in the circle of firelight and Mary is 
setting the tin plates, cups, etc., out. Elaine, a blanket 
around her, sits near the fire. She looks tired and ill. 
Marcia and Helen are struggling with bed-making under the 
wagon.

HELEN'S VOICE
And I'm the girl who used to complain 
to my mother about helping with the 
wash.

Steve and Mary look up as Clay strides up. Clay starts kicking 
dirt over the fire.

CLAY
Get your rifle.

Steve jumps up and hurries to the wagon. Clay continues 
kicking dirt over the fire.

EXT. CAMP - NIGHT - (MOONLIGHT)

LONG SHOT - ANGLES PAST horseman. The horseman, who has been 
approaching from the east, tops a rise and looks off at the 
camp. He is a shadowy figure in the palo dark. For a moment, 
as the fire still blazes, figures are visible in the camp. 
Then the fire goes out. The horseman dismounts, pulling his 
rifle from his scabbard. Moving to his horse's head he puts 
a hand on the animal's nostrils. He looks toward the camp 
for a moment then starts cautiously along the road.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT - (MOONLIGHT)

MED. SHOT - ANGLED THROUGH willows PAST Clay and Steve. The 
brothers have taken up a post overlooking the road. The 
horseman walks cautiously toward them. He stops, listening. 
Then he drops his reins and comes forward stealthily. The 
horse stands.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

Clay and Steve. Steve, finger on trigger gives Clay a 
questioning glance. Clay shakes his head.

CLAY
(calling)
Hold it.

ANOTHER ANGLE

on road. The man, now seen clearly for the first time, stops. 
He is Jim Clayton, a man in his twenties, chunky, round-faced, 
stolid and not too imaginative. He wears the well-worn jeans 
and blue shirt of the farmer. Clay and Steve come out of the 
willows toward him. Both have their rifles ready.

CLAY
Drop your gun.

Clayton hesitates, then lets his rifle butt drop to the road.

CLAYTON
(mildly)
Drop yours. I'm gunshy.

CLAY
Then don't come sneakin' around a 
man's camp.

CLAYTON
A fellow sees a fire go out all of a 
sudden, he don't take chances. My 
name's Clayton and I'm looking for 
someone.

Clay and Steve lower their rifles.

CLAYTON
I found their surrey --

CLAY
So did I. They were in it.

CLAYTON
She's a friend -- took off this 
morning sort of sudden while I wasn't 
around.

Clay moves closer and extends his hand. They shake.

CLAY
(very cordial)
I'm glad you came along.
(introducing)
My brother, Steve. I'm Phillips.

Steve shakes Jim's hand.

CLAY
I gave the girls a lift. Didn't know 
what else to do with them. Get your 
horse and come on.

Clayton turns back toward his horse. Clay and Steve wait for 
him.

EXT. CAMP - NIGHT - (MOONLIGHT)

MED. SHOT - ANGLED BACK ALONG the trail. Mary and Helen, 
tense and worried, stand at the edge of the camp, looking 
off. Marcia is with Elaine under the wagon. From o.s. comes 
the SOUND of men's voices. Clay, Steve and Clayton, leading 
his horse, come into view.

CLOSE SHOT ON WAGON

Marcia kneeling on the tarp by Elaine, is staring ahead. 
Suddenly her face lights up. She springs to her feet.

MARCIA'S ANGLE

Clay, Steve and Jim are now close to Mary.

CLAY
(genial)
Here's a man says he's looking for 
you girls.

CLAYTON
Hello, Miss Wells.

Hearing his voice, Marcia runs toward them.

GROUP SHOT

Marcia throws herself into Jim's arms.

MARCIA
Jim.

MED. CLOSE

Clayton kisses her.

CLAYTON
I was roundin' up some stock. That's 
why I didn't come sooner.

Marcia hugs him. In the B.g. Clay goes over to the fire, 
kicks the dirt off the embers and piles on wood. The fire 
flares up.

CLAYTON
What do you mean running off without 
a word.

TWO SHOT

Mary and Helen.

MARCIA'S VOICE
I didn't know who to tell, it all 
happened so sudden, those people 
comin' and throwin' us out on the 
street.

JIM'S VOICE
Don't you think about it, darlin'. 
Don't you think about anythin' but 
us.

HELEN
(quietly)
Looks like we lose a good piano 
player.

CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS as Marcia and Jim come forward. The fire 
now burns briskly. Clay rejoins the group.

MARCIA
(happily)
Jim came after me, Mary.

MARY
(dryly)
I see he did.

HELEN
With a milk pail in one hand and a 
marriage license in the other.

MARY
(sharp)
Why didn't you say you wanted to get 
married back in Aspen. I told the 
man in Sonora there were four of us. 
If only three show up, he might call 
the whole deal off. We've got to 
stick together. Like we've always 
done.

MARCIA
I've got a chance to get married.

MARY
(quickly)
That's what I'm gettin' at. It never 
works. Don't forget we were thrown 
out of Aspen.

MARCIA
Jim doesn't care, do you, Jim?

Mary speaks before Jim can answer.

MARY
But Jim isn't the only one you're 
marrying. He has folks and friends. 
What are they going to say? And how're 
they going to feel? I tell you, it 
won't work.

The joy goes out of Marcia's expression. She looks up at 
Jim, her eyes begging him to tell her it will work. Jim, a 
naturally shy man, loses his tongue momentarily. Clay jumps 
into the breach.

CLAY
Of course it'll work. You can get 
another girl to fill out the act.

MARY
(ignoring him)
And look at it this way. How about 
Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough 
spot.

JIM
I know what I'm doing. My folks got 
nothin' to do with it --

MARY
You've talked this over with them?

JIM
They know about Marcia.

MARY
(quickly)
And they don't like the idea!

CLAY
Suppose they don't. This is his 
problem. He's over twenty-one. He 
wants to marry Marcia and Marcia 
wants to marry him so let 'em alone.

Mary turns on Clay.

TWO SHOT

Clay and Mary. The others in the b.g.

MARY
If you were in his shoes would you 
take one of us home?

CLAY
I'm not in his shoes, so leave me 
out of it.

CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS as he turns back to the fire, embarrassed 
by the spot he's in, and throws wood on it, Mary watching 
him. Steve comes over to Mary.

STEVE
(friendly)
I would!

Clay swings around and comes back.

CLAY
(hurriedly; smiles)
Steve maybe you better get some wood 
for the fire.

MARY
Would you, Mr. Phillips?

CLAY
(to Steve)
Go on, there's a good boy.

Clay gives Steve a gentle push. Steve exits.

MARY
(bitter)
Don't you want him to hear your 
answer? Well, I know what it is. For 
the other fellow it's all right -- 
but not you. All you want is to get 
rid of one of us.

JIM
Wait a minute.

Jim, his arm around Marcia, moves closer. Helen is in the 
B.g., watching.

JIM
No need of you two arguin' about 
this. We know what we want to do, 
and nothin' either of you says makes 
any difference. We want to go home -- 
tonight.
(to Clay)
Will you sell me one of your horses?

CLAY
I'm sorry. I can't do that. I went a 
long way to get those horses.

JIM
All right, we'll ride double. Come 
on, Marcia.

Taking her arm he leads her to where the horse stands at the 
edge of the camp.

ANOTHER ANGLE

featuring Marcia and Jim. In the B.g. Mary comes after them.

MARY
No need to do that, Marcia.

Jim and Marcia turn.

MARY
We've got two horses and they're 
four of us. So half of one of 'em is 
yours.
(smiling)
The other half's a wedding present.

Marcia comes over to hug Mary. As Marcia and Jim leave, Mary 
moves to Clay.

MARY
Big-hearted fella. Can't see young 
love thwarted -- especially if it 
makes one less girl to worry about. 
That's all you really want, isn't 
it.

DISSOLVE

EXT. CAMP SITE - NIGHT

MED. SHOT. Mary stands in the moonlight by the wagon, looking 
out across the meadow. Below, near the creek, the horses 
graze. There is the soft jangle of a bell as the bell mare 
moves her head. Clay comes walking up from the creek, rifle 
in hand. He passes without noticing Mary. Mary turns.

REVERSE SHOT

Mary in close F.g. The campfire burns low. Steve lies on his 
stomach close to it. Clay stops beside him to glance down, 
then moves on to sit on a rock above the fire. Mary starts 
toward the fire.

MED. CLOSE

Steve. Open in front of him is a copy of Leslie's Weekly, a 
woman's journal: pictures of baby basinettes, whale-bone 
corsets, fancy oil lamps, etc. Mary comes into scene to stand 
above him, looking down. Steve glances up and smiles.

MARY
Is that your kind of reading, Steve?

STEVE
I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at 
the pictures.

MED. SHOT

ANGLED DOWN PAST Clay.

MARY
You can't read?

She glances up where Clay sits.

MARY
Your brother's always looked after 
you, hasn't he?

STEVE
Since I can remember, Ma'am.

MARY
But he just never troubled to have 
you get any schooling?

CLOSE SHOT

Clay. He listens, perturbed.

MED. SHOT

Mary and Steve.

STEVE
It wasn't Clay's fault. We've been 
moving around most all the time -- 
mebbe when we get the ranch and stay 
in one place I can learn my letters 
then --

MARY
Don't you even know your letters?

CLOSE SHOT

Clay. He winces at!

STEVE'S VOICE
No, Ma'am.

MED. SHOT

Mary, Steve and Clay. Behind them, Clay rises and comes down 
nearer the fire.

MARY
Would you like to learn them?

STEVE
I sure would.

MARY
Maybe I could start you out.

STEVE
That'd be swell.
(shyly)
You know, you're an awful lot 
different than I thought you'd be.

She gives him a quick look of inquiry.

STEVE
You're so nice.

MARY
Did someone say I wasn't nice?

STEVE
Oh no. Nobody said nothing to me. 
Only I got the idea that -- well 
Clay and me used to be walking through 
town and there was your place and 
through the window I could see you 
dancing, but Clay always took me 
over to the other side of the street.

CLAY
(interrupting)
Time to go to bed, Steve.

Steve looks up, then rises reluctantly.

STEVE
Good night, Miss Wells.

MARY
Good night, Steve.

Steve exits. Mary looks after him, then up at Clay.

MARY
(soft)
There's a nice boy.

CLAY
Yeah.

MARY
(sharp)
That why you always took him on the 
other side of the street?

Clay kicks loose embers into the fire.

MARY
(sharper)
Maybe I don't make the grade in some 
ways, but I know enough to teach a 
kid his letters.

Clay turns from the fire to stand above her.

CLAY
(quiet)
He doesn't know his letters, no -- 
but he knows the names of animals... 
he knows what roots to eat when you're 
clear out of food... He knows the 
difference between a possum and a 
coon just by lookin' at the tracks... 
more than most trappers know... and 
he can tell whether she'll rain or 
shine tomorrow by smelling the air 
tonight. There's a lot of things he 
doesn't know, I hope he'll never 
learn.

He pauses, looking down.

MARY
Like what?

CLAY
(turning away)
Like sticking his nose into other 
people's business.

Clay moves out of the circle of firelight to stop and pick 
up his rifle, tarp and blanket, then climbs the knoll. Mary 
stares into the fire, then rising she starts toward the wagon.

EXT. KNOLL - NIGHT - MOONLIGHT

MED. SHOT. Clay reaches the top of the knoll and stands 
looking off. Below him the campfire burns low. Mary reaches 
the wagon.

EXT. WAGON - MOONLIGHT - NIGHT

MED. SHOT ANGLED PAST Mary TOWARD Clay. Mary stops, looking 
up. A match flares as Clay lights a cigarette. O.s. there is 
the SOUND of the bell mare's bell, the SOUND of horses moving 
restlessly. Mary turns, looks under the wagon.

MED. CLOSE DOWN ANGLE

Elaine is gone. Helen is asleep. Mary drops to her knees on 
the tarp and shakes Helen in wakefulness.

MARY
Where's Elaine?

Helen sits up and looks over at Elaine's side of the bed.

HELEN
She was here a while ago.

Mary straightens, moves down past the wagon, CAMERA PANNING 
WITH her. She calls softly.

MARY
(softly)
Elaine!

MED. CLOSE

Clay. He looks down toward the wagon as Mary calls Elaine's 
name again, this time louder.

MARY'S VOICE
Elaine.
(then)
Clay -- Elaine's gone.

Clay frowns, pitches his cigarette away and starts down toward 
the wagon.

MED. CLOSE

Steve. He is sitting up, pulling on his boots. From under 
the bedclothes he takes his rifle and starts toward the wagon.

MED. SHOT

wagon. Clay stands with Mary at the wagon as Steve comes up. 
Helen is sitting up in bed, a comforter pulled around her.

HELEN
She can't have gone far. I wasn't 
asleep long.

CLAY
What would she run off for?

MARY
(excited)
Because she's sick.

She starts away into the darkness.

CLAY
(sharp)
Stay here. One woman wanderin' off's 
enough.

Mary turns back.

STEVE
Don't you worry, Miss Wells. We'll 
find her.

Clay picks up his saddle and bridle.

CLAY
(to Mary)
Build the fire up and stick close to 
it. Come on, Steve.

He starts down toward the meadow. Steve follows. Helen 
scrambles out from under the wagon.

EXT. CREEK - NIGHT - MOONLIGHT

Clay stops by the creek. Behind him the fire smoulders near 
the wagon. Mary's shadowy figure can be seen climbing the 
knoll where Clay's bedroll is. Helen is near the fire.

CLAY
(annoyed)
Look around. She can't have gone 
far.

Steve nods and splashes across the creek to follow the road 
leading west. Clay starts toward the meadow where the horses 
graze.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT - (MOONLIGHT)

MED. SHOT. Steve moves slowly along the road away from camp. 
He is scanning the dust for Elaine's footprints.

EXT. KNOLL - NIGHT - (MOONLIGHT)

LONG SHOT - ANGLED PAST Mary. Mary stands on the knoll looking 
off. Far below, in the meadow, Clay saddles his horse.

MARY
(calling)
Elaine -- Elaine -- Elaine.

EXT. MEADOW - NIGHT - MOONLIGHT

MED. SHOT. Clay swings into the saddle, and rides east. O.s. 
Mary calls:

MARY'S VOICE
Elaine -- Elaine.

As the call echoes across the hills.

DISSOLVE

EXT. DESERT - NIGHT - (MOONLIGHT)

MED. SHOT. This is rough country, the rocky hills covered 
sparsely with scrub pinon pine and brush. Steve stands on a 
rise. He looks around for a moment, then turning starts back 
down the slope. Suddenly he stops and listens, as from O.s. 
comes the SOUND of distant sobbing.

CLOSE SHOT

Steve. He listens, trying to locate the sound then he hurries 
down into a dry wash.

EXT. WASH

Steve crashes through the brush into the wash, to stop beside 
Elaine who sits with her head buried in her arms, sobbing.

MED. CLOSE

Steve and Elaine. Steve drops on his knees beside her. Elaine 
doesn't look up. Steve shakes her.

STEVE
Ma'am -- you shouldn't have run off 
like that. Why I was just about to 
give up lookin'. Come on, now.

Elaine doesn't move.

STEVE
You can't stay here. There's snakes 
and it's cold and you'll just get 
sicker.

ELAINE
I don't care.

STEVE
Suppose that Lednov was to have found 
you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't 
have had a chance.

ELAINE
(sharp)
I said I didn't care.

STEVE
What's botherin' you, anyway?

He pulls her up.

STEVE
Runnin' off and worryin' people. 
Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is 
already.

ELAINE
(hysterical)
Don't ask me because I won't tell 
you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!

STEVE
Don't act so -- crazy.

ELAINE
(dully)
I'm sorry. Let's go.

STEVE
(relieved)
That's a good girl.

CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS as he tucks her arm in the crook of his 
own and starts up the other side of the wash.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Steve, holding Elaine's arm, scrambles up the bank and through 
the brush.

STEVE
That's it. Watch out where you're 
steppin' --

He stops and looks off. Faintly O.s. is heard the SOUND of 
hoofbeats.

STEVE
That oughta be --
(then sharp)
Down.

He shoves the girl down.

LONG SHOT

their ANGLE. Over a hill comes a horseman to be followed by 
another and then a third.

CLOSE SHOT

Steve and Elaine.

STEVE
Lednov --

Excitedly he swings the rifle to his shoulder and fires.

EXT. DESERT - NIGHT - MOONLIGHT

FULL SHOT - Clay reins his horse in and turns to look off in 
the direction from which the shot came. Faintly o.s. another 
shot echoes across the hills, then another and another. Clay 
spurs his horse and gallops off.

EXT. HILLTOP - NIGHT - MOONLIGHT

Clay gallops up the hill to rein his horse in suddenly.

MED. LONG SHOT

his ANGLE. Riding toward him are several horsemen. The horses 
move at a walk. One carries a double burden. Steve walks 
along behind. Clay spurs his horse and rides down toward 
them.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Clay, in the B.g., comes down the hill. The horsemen, seven 
of them, with Sheriff Gardner in the lead, followed by a 
deputy, carrying Elaine in front of him, file past camera. 
Steve, hands in his pockets, walks dejectedly in the dust 
cloud kicked up by the horses.

MED. SHOT

featuring Clay and Gardner. Clay reins in his horse beside 
Gardner, who also stops. The others rein in. Steve stops a 
short distance away.

GARDNER
Want to take her off our hands?

Clay rides closer. The deputy rides forward and lifts Elaine 
into his arms. Clay settles her in front of him.

CLAY
Who shot who?

GARDNER
Nobody. The light was bad.

There are two rifles in his saddle holster. He pulls Steve's 
out, hands it over.

GARDNER
Steve's!

Clay shoves it in his saddle holster.

GARDNER
What's she doin' runnin' around the 
country at night.

CLAY
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?

GARDNER
All I can get out of her is she don't 
care about livin'.

CLAY
Look of things, she doesn't.

GARDNER
Yeah. Keep a closer eye on her --
(motioning to Steve)
And him. Shootin' going on, we'll 
never find Lednov.

He wheels his horse and rides off, followed by the others 
Clay watches him go. Reluctantly Steve moves slowly up to 
stand near Clay.

STEVE
There was only three of them at first. 
I guess I lost my head.

CLAY
(dryly)
How'd you happen to miss?

STEVE
They were quite a ways off and the 
wind was blowin'. I didn't have them 
to aim.

CLAY
Good thing you didn't.

He reins his horse around.

STEVE
Clay --

Clay looks back.

STEVE
A man can't help gettin' excited 
once in a while.

CLAY
That's right, Steve.

STEVE
Can I have my gun back?

CLAY
Sure. You'll find it under the wagon 
seat. Like I said before, a twenty-
two's more your size.

FADE OUT

EXT. TRAIL - DAY FADE IN

EXTREME LONG SHOT. West are the Sierras and clouds are piled 
in untidy heaps on the range. The dusty trail runs through 
rolling country. Pinon pine and brush clothe the slopes. The 
wagon and horses are the moving center of a white cloud of 
dust.

FULL SHOT

Clay's party. Clay rides in the lead. The wagon follows and 
Steve is riding beside the wagon. Behind is the remuda, and 
the horses are straying off the road in search of grass.

MED. SHOT

wagon - (MOVING). Featuring Steve and Mary. Elaine lies under 
the seat and Helen sits beside her. Steve is reciting the 
alphabet to a simple melody usually sung by children of six 
or seven.

STEVE
(stumbles embarrassedly)
Gee, I can't.

MARY
Why not? You went farther than that 
last time.

STEVE
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... 
That's for little kids.

MARY
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old 
to learn.

STEVE
(resolutely)
Okay. A-B-C -- D-E-F -- G-H-I --

CLOSE SHOT

Clay. He turns in his saddle where he rides ahead of the 
team. He notices Steve riding at Mary's side and reins in 
his horse.

CLAY
(mildly)
Oh, Steve!

MED. SHOT

Steve and Mary. Steve stops his letters. looks off. The wagon 
moves up to Clay and stops.

CLAY
Get back to the horses. They're 
straggling.

MARY
He's learning his letters.

CLAY
Yeah. While the horses wander all 
over the country.

Steve hesitates hoping he'll change his mind.

CLAY
(sternly)
Do like I said.

Steve wheels his horse and rides back. Mary looks over at 
Clay.

MARY
(dryly)
Learnin' to read has nothing to do 
with the right or the wrong side of 
the street.

CLAY
(motioning)
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't 
they?

MARY
(after a backward 
glance)
They're stragglin'.

CLAY
His letters will keep.

He wheels his horse and rides after Steve.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Steve is driving the horses back into the road. Clay rides 
up to help him. The horses fall in behind the wagon. Steve 
takes up his position in the rear. Clay rides over beside 
him.

MED. SHOT

CLAY AND STEVE. (MOVING)

CLAY
Steve -- I want you to learn to read. 
I meant to teach you but I never 
seemed to find time. I figured when 
we got settled on the ranch we'd get 
around to it.

They ride in silence for a moment.

CLAY
It's all right with me if she teaches 
you, but I don't want you forgettin' 
your job.

STEVE
(flat)
I won't again.

ANOTHER ANGLE

One of the horses strays out of line and Clay rides out and 
gets the animal back in the road. Then he returns to Steve.

TWO SHOT - (MOVING)

CLAY
This isn't like other trips we've 
taken. For one thing, we've got a 
wagonload of women. For another 
there's a guy wanderin' around hopin' 
to put a bullet in my back.

Steve looks over at his brother and finds a wry grin.

STEVE
Okeh, I was wrong. But you can't 
expect a fellow who never saw Lednov 
and never heard his name until a 
while ago to do too much worryin'. 
You've been sorta close mouthed about 
him.

CLAY
I guess I have. You were pretty little 
when they locked him up. I don't 
suppose you even remember that time 
I was gone two months.

STEVE
Sure I remember. You went to Mexico 
lookin' for cattle.

CLAY
(nods; then, after a 
moment)
You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used 
to go fishing and hunting with him 
when you were so high.

STEVE
(offended)
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico 
or something...

CLAY
That's what I told you then. Only he 
didn't. Lednov killed him.

STEVE
Oh... that's the time you went away.

CLAY
(nods)
I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. 
He didn't like the idea of comin' 
back across the border but he came. 
I turned him over to the sheriff and -- 
that's the story.

STEVE
(looking off)
Maybe you shoulda killed him.

CLAY
Maybe I should. But I was never much 
on killin'. Anyway, he moved too 
quick and I just got him through the 
shoulder.
(glances off)
Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.

STEVE
Yeah, it does.

CLAY
But you never can tell. Why don't 
you get that new rifle out of the 
wagon?

Steve smiles warmly at him.

CLAY
And while you're there you might as 
well find out what comes after K.

DISSOLVE

EXTREME LONG SHOT

Cavalcade. It moves through dry barren hills. Far off, the 
Sierras rise against the sky Thunder heads are piled in untidy 
heaps on the range.

DISSOLVE OUT

EFFECT SHOT DISSOLVE IN

sky. Dark rain clouds blown by a high wind. SOUND of thunder.

FULL SHOT

rain -- the caravan. Clay leads it through a rain that has 
filled the ruts in the trail, soaked the horses to glistening 
black -- and obscures all view of the country through which 
they are passing. SOUND of rain falling is loud. Clay and 
Steve both wear slickers, gleaming from their shoulders to 
the rumps of their horses. Mary, a tarp around her shoulders, 
drives. Elaine and Helen huddle under a tarpaulin in the 
wagon bed.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

rain -- DOWN ANGLE -- wagon moving. Elaine sits up and, in 
her delirium, throws off the tarp. Helen tries to pull her 
down.

HELEN
(crying out)
Elaine -- stop it --

CLOSE SHOT

rain -- Clay. He wheels his horse at the SOUND of Helen's 
voice and rides back through the rain toward the wagon.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

rain -- wagon. Mary pulls on the reins and the mules stop. 
Twisting them around the whip-stock, she swings back into 
the wagon bed. She looks up at Clay.

MARY
She should be in bed where it's dry.

In her anxiety, her tone is accusing. Clay drops the reins, 
climbs into the wagon and bends down beside Elaine. He puts 
his hand on her forehead.

MED. CLOSE

rain - DOWN ANGLE - featuring Clay and Mary.

CLAY
(dryly)
Yes, Ma'am, she should...

He starts fixing the tarp so it gives more protection to the 
sick girl.

CLAY
But the nearest shelter's the Wyatt 
ranch and that's maybe five hours 
away.

MARY
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?

CLAY
(straightening)
No, Ma'am, we can't. We can get a 
roof and a fire and maybe Mrs. Wyatt 
knows something about taking care of 
sick people.

ANOTHER ANGLE

rain. Clay vaults out of the wagon and mounts his horse. 
Mary rises and climbs back into the seat. She lashes the 
mules with the reins. The wagon jolts forward.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

rain - ANGLED ACROSS seat - (MOVING). Clay rides alongside. 
Then, without a word, he strips off his slicker, tosses it 
on the seat and rides off. Mary looks after him, then at the 
slicker. She hesitates, not wanting to take favors from him. 
Then she pulls the slicker around her. Taking the whip, she 
hits the mules. CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS and CAMERA HOLDS. The 
team breaks into a trot. The cavalcade moves away from camera 
through drenching rain.

DISSOLVE

EXT. WYATT RANCH - DAY

LONG SHOT - ANGLED THROUGH gate in barbed wire fence. The 
ranch is nestled in a valley at the base of the Sierras. 
Green meadowland surrounds the farm buildings which consist 
of a cabin, barn and sheds, all in good repair and white-
washed, as are the corral fences and the picket fence around 
the house, which stands in a clump of trees. The wind has 
pushed the clouds back over the hills, but far off there is 
still thunder. The gate in front f.g. is of barbed wire. It 
is closed. On the fence post a board is tacked. Neatly 
lettered on the board is the name:

ED WYATT

From o.s. comes the SOUND of horses moving restlessly and 
the creaking of saddle leather, as a man swings out of the 
saddle. Footsteps approach. A man's head and shoulders, back 
to camera, comes into scene. He unloops the strand of bailing 
wire and lets the gate fall open, then turns and we see his 
face. He is Lednov. His cheek and jowls have a dark growth 
of beard. He wears a black leather jacket and a wrangler's 
grey hat. The clothes Forster was wearing. As he moves back 
to his horse, CAMERA PULLS BACK and PANS AROUND.

His companions, McCall and Peters, also wear black leather 
jackets, sombre, dusty pants and hats. They are mounted on 
matched roans. The horses are winded, lathered and dirty. It 
is obvious they have ridden hard. Lednov strides forward and 
as he reaches for the reins the horse shies away. Brutally 
he jerks on the reins. The horse rears. He snatches his hat 
from his head and whacks the horse across the nose. McCall 
rides over and grabs the reins. Lednov scrambles into the 
saddle.

MED. SHOT

ANGLED TOWARD gate. Lednov rides forward through the gate. 
His horse is limping badly. The others follow. They do not 
stop to put the gate back up.

DISSOLVE

EXT. TRAIL - DAY

LONG SHOT. Clay's cavalcade moves forward along the trail. 
There are cloud patches overhead and faintly in the back 
country thunder rumbles. The mules pull the jolting wagons 
forward in a slow trot. Clay rides ahead. Steve and the remuda 
follow.

DISSOLVE

EXT. WYATT RANCH - DAY

FULL SHOT. Lednov, McCall and Peters ride into the yard and 
up to the horses' trough. The horses plunge their muzzles 
deep into the trough. As the men dismount, Wyatt, a sinewy 
little man, hurries from the direction of the barn.

MED. SHOT

at horse trough. Wyatt, smiling his pleasure, comes up as 
the three men dismount.

WYATT
(happily)
My name's Wyatt. Certainly glad you 
boys dropped in.

He extends his hand to Lednov. Lednov ignores it. The three 
men are looking around them. Two work horses, fat and elderly, 
amble across the corral to nuzzle the roans through the fence.

LEDNOV
Those the only horses you got?

Wyatt is a little taken aback by Lednov's manner.

WYATT
Why, yes. They're all I need...

LEDNOV
Mine's gone lame. Take a look at 
him.

Wyatt frowns up at Lednov, angered by the order.

LEDNOV
Go on, we haven't got all day.

McCall and Peters move closer to Wyatt, who glances around 
worriedly. Realizing he better do as he's told, he goes to 
the roan and rubs his ears.

WYATT
Whoa, boy. Let's have a look.

Bending, he lifts the horse's hoof. Lednov, McCall and Peters 
watch him. He drops the hoof, straightens.

WYATT
He dropped a shoe. You shouldn't be 
ridin' him.

LEDNOV
Put on another one.

WYATT
That won't help the stone bruise. 
You ain't been around horses much, 
looks like.

LEDNOV
Will you quit gabbin' and do what 
you're told.

Wyatt hesitates. Lednov steps toward him.

WYATT
(frightened, bewildered)
All right, but it won't do much good.

He picks up the roan's reins and starts leading him into the 
corral. Lednov, with a jerk of his thumb, indicates that 
McCall is to go with him. McCall follows. Lednov and Peters 
turn toward the house.

ANOTHER ANGLE

As Lednov and Peters start for the house, Mrs. Wyatt, a woman 
of about fifty, small, plump, browned from the sun and hard 
from work, comes out on the porch. She has taken off her 
apron and holds it in her hand. She smiles at the two men.

MED. SHOT

ANGLED PAST Mrs. Wyatt. She starts down the steps as Lednov 
and Peters come up.

MRS. WYATT
I was up to my elbows in flour when 
you boys rode up, that's why I din't 
come out sooner. I hope Ed asked you 
to stay the night?

LEDNOV
All we want's supper.

At his tone, the welcoming smile leaves her face. She looks 
from one to the other. Lednov pushes past her up the steps 
and into the house. Mrs. Wyatt follows him with her glance. 
McCall motions.

MCCALL
We're in a hurry.

DISSOLVE

EXT. TRAIL

LONG SHOT. In the f.g. the cavalcade moves along the trail. 
Now the Sierras back of the Wyatt ranch are much closer. The 
sun has set but it is still light.

DISSOLVE

EXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY

MED. SHOT. Peters sprawls on the ground, smoking. He looks 
up as Wyatt and McCall cross from the direction of the barn.

PETERS
Take care of that horse?

WYATT
(gruffly)
Yeah. The best I could.

Wyatt goes on past and hurries up the steps.

INT. RANCH HOUSE

ANGLED PAST Wyatt. This is the main room of the house -- a 
living room and kitchen combined: wood-stove against one 
wall, a sink with a pump against another, a fireplace, some 
simple furniture and, hanging from one of the rough walls, a 
concertina. Through an open doorway can be seen the Wyatt's 
bedroom. Another door, closed, leads into the second bedroom. 
The house has a warm, well-scrubbed look. Wyatt enters.

Mrs. Wyatt, stoking the stove, turns. She glances nervously 
in the direction of the bedroom. Wyatt shifts his glance to 
the fireplace -- there is no gun hanging from the hooks above 
the mantel. Lednov appears in the doorway of the bedroom.

WYATT
What are you doin' --

LEDNOV
Lookin' around.

He crosses to the fireplace. He is carrying Wyatt's rifle, 
gun belt and six gun.

LEDNOV
These all the shells you got?

Wyatt has had as much of this as he can stand. He starts 
angrily across the room.

WYATT
Put my guns down and get out of here --

MRS. WYATT
Ed -- no, Ed.

She crosses to him and stands in his way. Wyatt pushes past 
her and grabs for the guns. Lednov gives him a swipe with 
the back of his hand, knocking him away easily.

LEDNOV
Your old woman's got sense -- you 
listen to her.

Mrs. Wyatt helps Ed to his feet. She puts an arm around him.

LEDNOV
I asked you -- these all the shells 
you got?

MRS. WYATT
(quickly)
They's a box in the cupboard over 
the sink.

Lednov crosses to the cupboard and opens it. Finding the box 
of shells, he slips it in his pocket.

LEDNOV
(to Ed)
Get on about your chores.
(to Mrs. Wyatt)
And hurry that grub up.

Wyatt and his wife look at each other. Then meekly they obey.

Clay's ANGLE. A light can be seen ahead in the valley.

REVERSE ANGLE

Clay turns and rides back toward the wagon. The mules have

He glances down into the wagon bed where Helen is sitting by 
Elaine.

CLAY
How's she makin' out?

HELEN
(dryly)
If she feels worse than I do, she's 
dyin'.

Clay rides back toward the rear.

CLAY
(calling)
Steve --

STEVE'S VOICE
Yo --

MED. FULL SHOT

The wagon reaches the crest of the hill. Mary hits the mules 
with the reins. The mules break into a trot. Behind, the 
remuda comes into view. Clay sits his horse by the side of 
the trail and watches.

EXT. FARM HOUSE - NIGHT

MED. SHOT. Mrs. Wyatt stands by the stove, watching the three 
men at the table. Wyatt sits in a chair by the stove.

MCCALL
I'll have some more of that coffee.

Lednov pushes his chair back and rises.

LEDNOV
We got to get movin'.

MCCALL
What for?

LEDNOV
Because there's a man I want to see.

MCCALL
He can wait. Let's stay here until 
morning.

Wyatt and his wife exchange frightened glances. That's the 
last thing they want.

LEDNOV
(rising)
I said let's go.

MCCALL
(protesting)
One night more won't matter. Your 
friend'll be there. Anyway I don't 
think so much of the idea of prowling 
around his ranch. He knows you're 
out so he ain't going to sit still 
for it.

LEDNOV
(fierce)
I said I had a guy to see and I'm 
going to see him.

With the fingers of his right hand he automatically rubs his 
shoulder just above the heart.

LEDNOV
He gave me something once so I 
wouldn't forget.

PETERS
(rising)
He says go, we go.

Grudgingly, McCall gives in. They exit. Wyatt stares after 
them raging at his impotence.

WYATT
If they'd only left me a gun, I'd 
fix 'em.

MRS. WYATT
Hush, Ed. Hush. They might come back.

EXT. CORRAL - NIGHT

MED. FULL SHOT. The three men mount their horse, dig their 
spurs in and ride away. As they ride toward the gate, Wyatt 
comes out on the steps.

EXT. TRAIL - NIGHT

LONG SHOT. Here the trail passes through a narrow draw, then 
climbs a small rise which overlooks the gate. Clay's caravan 
jogs along the trail.

EXT. HILLTOP - NIGHT

LONG SHOT - DOWN ANGLE. The caravan climbs toward camera. 
CAMERA PANS AROUND to SHOOT DOWN TOWARD the Wyatt ranch. 
Through the gate ride Lednov, McCall and Peters. They stop 
for a moment then turn right and trot along the fence line. 
As they disappear, the SOUND of the caravan's approach is 
heard o.s.

DISSOLVE

EXT. WYATT RANCH - NIGHT - (MOONLIGHT)

MED. FULL SHOT. Clay gallops into the yard and swings out of 
the saddle. The farmhouse is dark.

INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

ANGLED THROUGH window, PAST Wyatt. Clay opens the gate and 
hurries up the steps and across the porch.

EXT. PORCH - NIGHT

MED. SHOT. Clay raps on the door.

CLAY
Mr. Wyatt.

WYATT'S VOICE
Who is it?

CLAY
Clay Phillips.

The door opens. Wyatt comes out. He pumps Clay's hand.

WYATT
(calling)
You can light the lamp.
(to Clay)
I'm sure glad it's you. We were afraid 
those killers might come back.

CLAY
Three men on matched roans?

In the kitchen a match flares as Mrs. Wyatt lights the lamp.

WYATT
Yeah, how did you know?

CLAY
The whole state's lookin' for 'em.
(dryly)
And they're lookin' for me.

Mrs. Wyatt comes out to stand in the doorway. She shakes 
Clay's hand.

MRS. WYATT
You don't know how good it is to see 
you.

CLAY
Maybe you won't feel that way after 
I tell you what I stopped in for.

He turns and motions off.

LONG SHOT

ANOTHER ANGLE. Clay, Wyatt and Mrs. Wyatt in f.g. The wagon 
is coming toward the yard followed by the remuda.

CLAY
I picked up some women on the road.

THREE SHOT

Clay, Mrs. Wyatt and Wyatt. O.s. the wagon and horses can he 
heard.

MRS. WYATT
Tell them to come on in.

CLAY
But I'm going to have to leave 'em 
here. They're --- well they're not 
the sort of people you're used to.

MRS. WYATT
(a reprimand)
It doesn't matter who they are.

CLAY
(lamely)
And one of 'em is sick.

MRS. WYATT
Why didn't you say so. Go right out 
and get her. Ed. build the fire up.

She turns back into the kitchen. Clay looks after her, then 
hurries down the steps. Wyatt follows his wife inside.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Wyatt goes to the stove and starts stoking the fire. Mrs. 
Wyatt takes the lamp from the wall bracket and goes into the 
bedroom.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

FULL SHOT. It is a pleasant room with a large, handmade, 
double bed, white flour sack curtains at wide windows. Mrs. 
Wyatt puts the lamp on the dresser. Going to the bed she 
pulls back the covers, feels the sheets.

MRS. WYATT
(calling)
Wrap a stove lid in dish towels and 
bring it in here. This bed's like 
ice.

MED. SHOT

Turning from the bed, she crosses to the dresser. Beside the 
dresser is a camel-back trunk. She starts to open a dresser 
drawer, pauses and looks down at the trunk. Moving to the 
trunk, she hesitates. Then making up her mind, she bends 
down and throws open the trunk.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

DOWN ANGLE. A girl's clothing is neatly packed in the trunk. 
A framed picture is face down on top of the clothing. Mrs. 
Wyatt kneels by the trunk, pushes the dresses aside and finds 
a nightgown. CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS as she rises and shakes it 
out. It is frilly, dainty, very feminino; obviously the 
nightdress of a young girl. She closes the trunk, turns and 
as she goes to the bed, Wyatt comes through the door carrying 
the towel-wrapped stove lid. She lays the nightgown on the 
bed, takes the stove lid and puts it between the sheets. 
Wyatt is staring down at the garment.

WYATT
(cold)
Put it back.

They face each other. Wyatt reaches out and takes the 
nightgown.

MRS. WYATT
Someone might as well get some good 
out of it. Wyatt crosses to the trunk.

MRS. WYATT
It isn't as if she was dead.

Wyatt opens the trunk, puts the nightgown in and closes the 
lid.

WYATT
(cold)
It stays there, understand!

The slamming of a door o.s. interrupts them. They turn and 
start for the door.

MRS. WYATT
(calling)
Right in here, Mr. Phillips.

She follows Wyatt to the doorway, CAMERA DOLLYING WITH her. 
She stops in the doorway.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

ANGLED PAST Mrs. Wyatt. Clay, carrying Elaine, bundled in 
blankets, comes forward. Wyatt has stopped just inside the 
kitchen. Mary and Helen follow Clay through the door.

MRS. WYATT
The bed's all ready and warm --

She stops, staring at the girl.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

The Wyatts in the doorway. They recognize the girl. Wyatt's 
expression hardens. Clay, carrying Elaine, pushes between 
them into the bedroom.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

MED. SHOT. Clay carries the girl to the bed and gently puts 
her down. Her eyes are closed. Slowly the Wyatts enter the 
room to stand close together staring at the girl on the bed. 
Clay suddenly realizes that something is wrong. He glances 
up. Elaine opens her eyes and looks up at her mother and 
father.

MRS. WYATT
(softly to Wyatt)
Go out and make some coffee.

Wyatt doesn't move.

MRS. WYATT
Go on. You too, Mr Phillips.

As Clay waits, Wyatt moves through the door unable to argue 
back.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

FULL SHOT. Mary and Helen stand close to the steve, looking 
anxiously toward the bedroom door as Clay and Wyatt come 
out. Clay closes the door. Wyatt, dazed by the shock of seeing 
his daughter again, stands momentarily staring at the closed 
door. Then very slowly he turns and looks at Helen and Mary.

MED. SHOT

his ANGLE. Mary and Helen, seeing the two men's expressions, 
look from one to the other, puzzled.

MARY
Is she very sick?

WYATT
(cold, flat)
Get 'em out of here. I won't have 
'em in this house.

He crosses to the kitchen door, exits, slamming the door 
behind him.

MARY
(softly)
So that was why she tried to run 
away.

CLAY
(sharp)
Didn't you know she had a father and 
mother out here?

MARY
(hurt and angry)
I didn't know anything about her 
except she wanted a job because some 
man had left her stranded. I couldn't 
leave her in the street. Let's go.

CLAY
Hold on.

MARY
We can't stay here!

CLAY
It's a long walk back to Aspen.

Turning from them, he exits. Mary and Helen look at each 
other. Then Helen grins wryly and goes over to the cupboard.

HELEN
I don't know about you. But I'm not 
being thrown out on an empty stomach.

EXT. CORRAL - NIGHT

MED. SHOT. Wyatt in the f.g. stands by the horse trough. His 
face is set, his expression hard, unyielding. Clay comes 
across the yard past the wagon. Wyatt doesn't look at him as 
Clay comes up.

TWO SHOT

Clay and Wyatt. Clay takes the makings from his pocket, rolls 
a cigarette, lights it.

CLAY
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I 
didn't know who she was.

WYATT
(quiet)
All right, you didn't know.

CLAY
I can't take her with me.

WYATT
Nobody asked you to.

O.s. Steve whistles the tune of the A B C song as he comes 
out of the barn.

WYATT
Just get those two out of here.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Steve approaches from the barn.

CLAY
You're not bein' quite fair.

WYATT
What's there to be fair about?

TWO SHOT

Clay and Wyatt. Clay takes the making from his pocket, rolls 
a cigarette, lights it.

CLAY
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I 
didn't know you had a daughter.

WYATT
(quiet)
All right, you didn't know.

CLAY
I can't take her with me.

WYATT
Nobody asked you to.

O.s. Steve whistles the tune of the A B C song as he comes 
out of the barn.

WYATT
Just get these two out of here.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Steve approaches from the barn.

CLAY
You're not bein' quite fair.

WYATT
What's there to be fair about?

Steve comes up.

STEVE
Hello, Mr. Wyatt.

He starts whistling again as he continues toward the wagon.

MED. SHOT

wagon. Steve picks up a couple of valises and some blankets 
and heads for the house, still whistling. In the b.g. can be 
heard the mutter of voices as Clay and Wyatt talk.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Helen is sitting at the table, eating a piece of bread and 
drinking coffee. Mary stands at the window. Steve is heard 
coming up the steps and across the porch. He pushes the door 
open and enters.

STEVE
(cheerfully)
Where do I put your things?

Mary turns from the window.

MARY
Back in the wagon.

Steve stands with his arms full, looking at Mary.

STEVE
Aren't we stayin'?

MARY
No. We're not stayin' --

She crosses to him and smiles wryly.

MARY
Everything's all mixed up, so don't 
ask questions.

Steve hesitates.

MARY
(soft)
Go on, Steve.

Steve exits.

EXT. PORCH - NIGHT

MED. CLOSE. Steve stops on the porch. He is puzzled, worried. 
He glances back then over toward the fence where Wyatt and 
Clay are talking. He shrugs and starts off toward the wagon.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

MED. SHOT. Mary crosses to the stove.

HELEN
Sit down and eat, why don't you?

Mary lifts the stove lid and puts a stick in the firebox.

HELEN
It isn't like this was the first 
place we were ever thrown out of.

MARY
That's not what's worryin' me. Why 
didn't she tell us? Maybe we could 
have done somethin' -- gone somewhere 
else -- puttin' a poor sick kid 
through this --

HELEN
Quit worryin' about Elaine.

She motions to the bedroom door.

HELEN
She's home, isn't she? So worry about 
us. We want to get to Sonora.

Footsteps across the porch. The two girls look toward the 
door.

ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT

SHOOTING PAST Mary. The door slowly opens. Wyatt enters. He 
crosses to the bedroom door, CAMERA PANNING WITH him. It is 
as though he doesn't see the two women. He stands in front 
of the door, staring at it. Then his hand moves to the knob. 
Slowly he turns the knob and opens the door. The two girls 
watch him as he hesitates on the threshold. Then he enters 
and closes the door softly. Helen looks over at Mary and 
smiles.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

MED. SHOT as Wyatt stops, looking at Elaine, resting back 
against the pillow, seeming very young in the nightgown. For 
a moment it is difficult to know what is in Wyatt's mind. 
Then he sees the twin tintypes. CAMERA MOVES TOWARD Wyatt's 
face as tears come to his eyes.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

MED. SHOT as footsteps cross the porch and the screen door 
creaks open. Clay enters the kitchen, carrying the girls' 
suitcases and some blankets. He nods to the girls, then goes 
to the door leading to the other bedroom. There he stops.

CLAY
This will be your room until Mr. 
Wyatt finds time to take you to the 
nearest stage station.

As he carries their belongings in:

DISSOLVE OUT

INT. MARY'S AND HELEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT DISSOLVE IN

The room is lighted only by the moonlight. Mary and Helen 
are in the big four poster bed, close to the window. Clay's 
footsteps are heard on the porch. The kitchen door closes 
softly. There is the rattle of a stove lid being lifted.

HELEN
(whispering)
That sounds like him.

Mary slides out of bed and slips into a robe.

HELEN
This time don't talk about cooking!

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Clay turns from the stove to the cupboard over the sink and 
takes down a coffee cup. The door into Elaine's bedroom is 
closed. The door into Mary's bedroom opens and Mary enters 
the kitchen. He turns back to the stove and fills his cup as 
Mary comes up.

CLAY
Coffee?

MARY
No, thanks.
(indicating Elaine's 
bedroom)
I hope we won't be a burden to them.

CLAY
I hope so, too.

He picks up his coffee and goes out on the porch. Mary 
hesitates, then follows.

EXT. PORCH - NIGHT

ANGLED PAST Clay. Mary comes out. Clay sits on the bench by 
the door, drinking his coffee.

CLAY
(quiet)
If you're figuring on asking me to 
take you, it's no use.

Mary crosses to stand above him.

MARY
A time like this people ought to be 
alone. Having us around is going to 
make it sort of hard on 'em.

Mary sighs, sits beside him. From the pocket of her robe she 
takes tobacco, rolls a cigarette and lights it. She passes 
the tobacco to Clay. He rolls one.

CLAY
(on the defensive)
I'm sorry, but that's how it's got 
to be.

MARY
I suppose it is.

CLAY
And it's not only because the trip's 
a tough one --

Mary strikes a match and holds the flame to his cigarette.

MARY
(softly)
You don't have to explain. Did I 
tell you how grateful I am for what 
you've done?

CLAY
I couldn't leave you sitting by the 
road.

MARY
You could have treated us like they 
did in Aspen. No. You wouldn't do a 
thing like that -- it isn't in you 
to be mean or cruel.

Mary rises to move to the edge of the porch.

MED. CLOSE

Mary in f.g.

MARY
(softly)
No man who brings up a kid like you've 
brought up Steve could ever be cruel 
to people.

Turning, she leans against the post that supports the porch.

MARY
I hope you get everything you want 
out of life --

CLAY
(wary)
Thanks.

MARY
You've earned it -- the horse ranch 
on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the 
spotted gingham.

CLAY
The who?

MARY
You should know. She's in your dream.

Clay puts his cup down, looks up. She is very lovely standing 
in the moonlight, her body arched back, the robe open a 
little.

MARY
Ever since you've looked after Steve 
you've had the dream -- a ranch on 
the river -- good grass, good water, 
barn corral and house --- that part 
you've shared with Steve. The girl 
in gingham you plan sneakin' in when 
he isn't looking.
(she pauses)

CLAY
(enigmatic)
Go on. Tell me more about her.

MARY
She wears this gingham dress -- cooks 
popovers -- makes jam in season -- 
makes her own soap from pig fat and 
wood ashes and has cheeks the color 
of red apples.

CLAY
(dryly)
I'll make the soap myself.

MARY
But the rest is right.

CLAY
Will she be dark or fair?

MARY
Blonde as a new mop. And beautiful 
as the girl on a feed store calendar.

Straightening, she crosses the porch to pause momentarily 
close to Clay.

MARY
(softly)
I hope you find her -- because, like 
I said, you've earned your dream. 
Goodnight.

She enters the house. Clay looks after her, smiling faintly. 
He knows she is up to something but not what.

INT. SECOND BEDROOM - NIGHT

MED. SHOT. Save for the moonlight coming through the window, 
the room is dark. Mary enters softly, throws off her robe 
and slips into bed beside Helen.

MED. CLOSE

on bed. Moonlight falls across the bed. Mary pulls the covers 
up. Helen turns her head.

HELEN
Did you make it interesting?

Mary snuggles down on the pillow.

MARY
I tried my best, but these things 
take time.

HELEN
And we're running out of that.

MARY
There's still tomorrow morning.

DISSOLVE

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

MED. LONG SHOT - ANGLED THROUGH window PAST Mary. The early 
morning sun fills the yard. Steve is in the corral harnessing 
the mules. Clay and Wyatt are taking Mary's and Helen's trunks 
out of the wagon.

HELEN'S VOICE
Those trunks look like ours.

Mary, who was in profile, turns.

MARY
They are.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Helen is seated at the table. Mary stands with her back to 
the window near the sink.

HELEN
How long do you think we'll have to 
stay here?

MARY
Until Pa gets around to driving us 
to Minden.

HELEN
We don't want to go there.

MARY
No we don't. But that's where we're 
going. From Minden we take a stage 
to Reno, then another one over to 
Auburn and another one to Placerville. 
Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.

HELEN
Clay could save us an awful lot of 
time.

MARY
He certainly could. About a month.

HELEN
What are you waiting for? Do 
something.

Mary comes over to stand by the table. Her expression is 
thoughtful.

HELEN
(sharp)
You're not giving up?

MARY
How many ways can a man say no.

Helen rises. Her manner is determined.

HELEN
(crosses to door)
Maybe I better start working on him.

MARY
You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's 
sake, at least...

CLOSE SHOT

as she stops, apparently inspired by Mary's last remark. She 
looks out into the yard where Clay is working on the wagon.

ANOTHER ANGLE

SHOOTING TOWARD Elaine's bedroom door. Helen crosses to Mary.

HELEN
(sweetly)
If you can't bring him around, nobody 
can.

She puts her arm around Mary's shoulder.

HELEN
Go on. Have another try at him.

MARY
What's the use.

HELEN
(cajoling)
Please. Maybe he'll take a good look 
at you and stop thinking so much 
about his horses.

As she speaks she edges Mary to the door leading outside.

HELEN
A man has only so many no's in him.

Mary smiles at her, shrugs and exits. Helen looks after her. 
Mary's footsteps are heard going down the steps. Then Helen 
swings around and going to Elaine's door, opens it.

INT. ELAINE'S BEDROOM

MED. SHOT. Elaine is sitting up in bed. There is a small 
table by the bed and on it is a breakfast tray. Mrs. Wyatt 
sits by the bed. Elaine looks happy for the first time. Mrs. 
Wyatt is holding a cup to her lips. Helen enters and closes 
the door.

HELEN
Look at you, sitting up already.

Crossing to the bed she takes the cup from Mrs. Wyatt.

HELEN
Let me do this while you get some 
breakfast.

MRS. WYATT
But I like to do it.

HELEN
You're worn out.

As she pushes Mrs. Wyatt toward the door.

HELEN
Now don't argue. You've got two able-
bodied girls to help you so take 
advantage of it. And don't let me 
catch you touching the dishes.

She closes the door behind Mrs. Wyatt and comes back, sits 
on the edge of the bed and holds the cup to Elaine's lips.

HELEN
Well -- it's going to be good for 
all of us -- having a nice long rest 
here. After all -- Sonora will still 
be there next month. Maybe we can 
rehearse a new number -- try it out 
on your folks.

Elaine tries not to show her panic at this suggestion.

ELAINE
Helen -- why don't you and Mary go 
on with Clay?

HELEN
He won't take us.
(then, hurt)
Don't you want us around?

ELAINE
Of course I do -- but it'd be better 
for you -- and the house is kind of 
small --

HELEN
If you're worried about Mary and me 
talkin' too much, don't. No matter 
how many questions your old man asks. 
We know how to keep our mouths shut.

ELAINE
It isn't that --

HELEN
Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get 
you well quick as we can so we can 
all get out of here.

ELAINE
But I want to stay.

HELEN
Drink this and stop being silly. Why 
would anyone want to live in this 
place. You might as well be dead and 
buried. Nothing to do but look at 
mountains. In a week you'd be talking 
to yourself.
(then, brightly)
Maybe that's what got you started in 
the first place.

Elaine pushes the cup away, sits up straighter.

ELAINE
(distraught)
I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying 
here where I belong.

HELEN
Not if I know Mary. When she rides 
into Sonora, you'll be with her. And 
mighty glad to be there after this. 
I don't see how you stood it as long 
as you did.

ELAINE
(sobbing)
Stop it -- stop it.

HELEN
(contrite)
Darling -- now I've got you all upset.

Elaine buries her head in the pillow.

ELAINE
Go away -- please.

HELEN
That's right -- you go back to sleep. 
Tomorrow when you feel better things 
will look a whole lot different. 
Don't you worry about anything -- 
Mary's going to talk things over 
with your folks --

Elaine sits up and grabs Helen's arm.

ELAINE
(fiercely)
She mustn't -- don't you let her --

HELEN
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --

ELAINE
(wildly)
If she says anything to them I'll 
kill her.

The door opens and Mrs. Wyatt enters. She hurries over to 
the bed, pushes Helen aside, and takes the sobbing girl in 
her arms.

ELAINE
(sobbing)
I don't want to leave you, ever.

Mrs. Wyatt flares at Helen.

MRS. WYATT
What did you do to her?

HELEN
Nothing. The poor child's worried 
about Mary --

Turning, she goes to the door.

HELEN
I won't let her say anything --

She exits.

INT. KITCHEN

MED. SHOT. Leaving the door open, Helen enters the kitchen. 
She glances back at the bedroom, half smiling, then crosses 
to the window and looks out.

EXT. YARD

ANGLED past Helen THROUGH window. Clay is crossing the yard 
toward the house.

INT. KITCHEN

MED. SHOT. Helen turns from the window and walks hurriedly 
to the second bedroom door. Clay's footsteps cross the porch. 
Helen enters the bedroom and closes the door as Clay comes 
in. Clay looks around, then seeing the open bedroom door, 
crosses to it.

INT. ELAINE'S BEDROOM

ANGLED PAST Clay in doorway. Mrs. Wyatt is holding the sobbing 
girl in her arms. She looks over at Clay.

CLAY
Well, I'm off --

Then realizing that something is wrong he steps into the 
bedroom.

MED. SHOT

CLAY
(puzzled)
What's the matter?

Hearing his voice, Elaine lifts her head from her mother's 
shoulder.

ELAINE
Don't let them stay here, Mr. 
Phillips. They'll spoil everything.

Clay looks from one to the other, frowning. Elaine tries to 
get out of bed. Her mother holds her.

ELAINE
(wildly)
Take them with you -- Mary's going 
to talk to dad -- she's going to 
keep talking and talking to me until 
maybe I won't want to stay here --

MRS. WYATT
Please take them.

CLAY
I can't --

ELAINE
You've got to -- don't you understand -- 
they want me with them and they'll 
fix it so I have to go --

CLAY
(sharp)
No they won't.

Turning, he exits. Mrs. Wyatt holds Elaine close.

EXT. PORCH

MED. SHOT. Helen stands on the porch in the sunlight. She 
glances back. Clay, his expression hard and angry comes out. 
He doesn't look at Helen but stalks down the steps toward 
the wagon.

MED. SHOT ON WAGON

STEVE
What comes after Z?

MARY
That's the end of the line.

STEVE
(happily)
Then I know my alphabet.

MARY
From A to Z. All you have to do now 
is figure out what they mean put 
together in words.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Clay comes toward the wagon. Helen stands on the porch.

STEVE
And that's tough, isn't it?

MARY
Without someone to teach you, it's 
tough.

Clay appears behind her. Mary turns and smiles.

MARY
He knows his alphabet.

CLAY
That's fine.

STEVE
I'll bet I'd be reading in a week if --

He catches Clay's glance and his face falls.

MARY
Maybe Clay will take up where I left 
off.

Steve gets some courage. He comes over to his brother and 
faces him.

STEVE
I don't think it's fair --

He pauses; Clay waits.

STEVE
Leaving them here when we could just 
as well take them. We got plenty of 
room in the wagon. And -- and -- 
they cook and drive the mules. They 
don't bother anybody.

CLAY
Finished, son?

STEVE
(weakly)
There's only two of them now.

Clay moves past them toward the corral. Mary looks after 
him, then turning, motions to Helen. Helen starts toward the 
wagon.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Clay's horse stands saddled at the fence. He vaults into the 
saddle, turns the horse.

CLAY
I'll round up the horses. Throw that 
junk in the wagon.

He rides off. Steve, delighted, runs to start loading the 
girls' things. Helen hurries into the scene.

MED. CLOSE

Mary and Helen. Mary smiles at Helen.

MARY
(happily)
You were right -- a man has only so 
many no's in him. But he had me 
worried -- that last one sounded so 
final.

Helen nods, looking at Mary as though in admiration.

DISSOLVE

EXT. WYATT RANCH

LONG SHOT - the wagon, followed by the remuda and with Clay 
riding ahead moves slowly up the canyon back of the ranch.

FADE OUT

EXT. FOREST TRAIL - DAY FADE IN

LONG SHOT - ANGLED WEST. The forest is fairly open, yellow 
pine, lodgepole and fir. To the West can be seen the bald 
red granite domes of the higher range. O.s. there is the 
SOUND of the cavalcade approaching. CAMERA PANS AROUND and 
ANGLES PAST. Toward camera, comes the cavalcade, climbing 
slowly. Far in the distance and down can be seen the waste 
of desert and the barren hills of Nevada. Clay, a rifle across 
his legs, is riding on one side of the wagon. Steve rides 
beside Mary, who is driving. The remuda trails behind. Helen, 
lying in the wagon bed, cannot be seen.

MED. TRUCKING SHOT

ANGLED PAST Steve. Steve has a copy of Leslie's Weekly open 
on the pommel. Helen lies full length in the wagon bed, 
occupying herself by giving herself a manicure with an orange 
stick.

STEVE
It's a lot tougher than I figured. 
Knowin' my letters is one thing. But 
makin' sense out of words is harder'n 
trackin' weasel after rain.

Clay glances over at his brother. Mary sees him watching. 
Their eyes meet. She smiles. He doesn't return the smile.

STEVE
-- and even if I do learn to read, 
what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live 
on a ranch!

MARY
There's plenty of use for reading -- 
you'll see.

He sighs and scowls down at the page. He puts his finger on 
a word and starts to spell it out.

STEVE
U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's 
that?

MARY
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --

STEVE
What do they look like?

MARY
Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with 
a horn in the center of its forehead.

STEVE
Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 
'em in Nevada?

MARY
No.

STEVE
How about California?

MARY
Would they be good to eat?

MARY
(not too sure)
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're 
not liable to hunt them -- I don't 
think there's any alive now, anyways -- 
and I'm not sure but I don't think 
there ever were...

STEVE
Then if they wasn't alive, how can 
they be an animal?...

Mary starts to protest -- Steve goes on.

STEVE
An' if you can't hunt 'em and even 
if you could they'd be tough, what's 
the use of knowin' how to spell them?

MARY
You don't read to fill your stomach... 
Poetry, for instance. All the poems 
in the world wouldn't fill you half 
as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but 
they make you feel good.

STEVE
(stubbornly)
I feel good anyways.

REVERSE SHOT

ANGLED PAST Clay.

CLAY
Don't go arguing with your teacher.

STEVE
I'm not, but there's some of it I 
don't see any sense to.

CLAY
There's a lot of things I don't see 
any sense to. But make up your mind. 
Learn to read or --
(motioning)
-- go back and watch the horses.

He touches his horse with his spurs and rides on ahead.

MED. CLOSE

ANGLED PAST Mary. Steve in the b.g. Mary looks after Clay, 
puzzled, wondering. Then she looks over at Steve.

MARY
Well, Steve?

STEVE
(grinning)
Now I know what a unicorn is, what 
do we do next?

EXT. FOREST TRAIL

Here the forest has thinned out. The trail climbs a rise, 
then drops down. Clay jogs along the trail, his rifle across 
his knees. As he reaches the edge of the forest at the crest 
of the rise, he suddenly pulls his horse to a stop, swings 
around and rides back into the trees. Throwing the reins 
over the horse's head, he swings out of the saddle and moves 
cautiously to the crest of the hill.

LONG SHOT

Clay's ANGLE. The trail leads down through open country to a 
big meadow ringed with lodgepole pine, and across the meadow 
to start climbing toward another, higher range of hills. 
Three horsemen on roans, Lednov, Peters and McCall, are 
crossing the meadow slowly.

MED. SHOT

DOWN ANGLE. Lednov, Peters and McCall as they ride across 
the meadow.

CLOSE SHOT

Clay, as he peers down. He cocks his rifle. The voices of 
Mary and Steve and the SOUND of the approaching wagon can be 
heard o.s. Clay turns his head.

FULL SHOT

the cavalcade. Mary and Helen are in the seat of the wagon. 
Steve rides alongside.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

Clay. He lowers his rifle, waves at them to stop and be quiet, 
rises and hurries down the hill, CAMERA PANNING WITH him.

EXT. MEADOW

MED. SHOT of Lednov as he pulls in his limping horse, steps, 
looking back over his shoulder as though he sensed an 
unfamiliar presence. The other two watch him, frowning. Then 
he shrugs and glances down at the bad leg of his mount.

LEDNOV
We'll camp on up ahead away. That 
leg ain't good...

As they start away, moving slowly toward the trees in the 
distance...

MED. FULL SHOT

Clay motions to Mary to stop as he hurries toward the wagon. 
Mary reins in the mules.

CLAY
We're staying here until dark.
(motioning)
Pull over to the woods.
(to Steve)
You put hobbles on the horses -- all 
of 'em. Get goin'.

DISSOLVE OUT

EXT. HILLTOP - DUSK DISSOLVE IN

LONG SHOT. Clay, in close foreground, stands, leaning on his 
rifle. The sun has set and the valley below is in shadow. 
There is the silence of dusk. No wind stirs the trees. There 
is some light outlining the high mountains -- treeless crags 
and domes and spires. Clay turns.

REVERSE SHOT

Down the hill in the forest, is the wagon. Beyond it the 
horses stand. Steve is stretched out on his stomach studying 
his magazine. Helen is sitting on a tarp playing solitaire. 
Clay starts down the hill toward the camp.

MED. SHOT - UP ANGLE

Clay walks through the trees. As he comes around a big yellow 
pine, he stops suddenly and looks down.

MED. CLOSE

ANGLED DOWN PAST Clay. Mary lies on the carpet of pine 
needles, her head pillowed on her arms, her dress pulled 
taut across her chest. She is looking up through the trees 
at the fading sky.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Clay stares down at Mary. She does not look at him. She is 
aware of his presence, but she doesn't show it. In the soft 
light of dusk she is very lovely. Clay is conscious of her 
lovliness. He would like to drop down beside her.

CLOSE SHOT

Mary. She turns her face to look at him. CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS. 
Clay stands above her, looking down. For a moment their eyes 
meet. Clay starts away. CAMERA HOLDS ON Mary.

MARY
Where you goin'? Over to the other 
side of the street?

MED. SHOT

ANGLED PAST Mary, who rises slowly. Clay looks back, 
hesitates, then crosses to where the horses are tethered and 
starts saddling his mare. Mary moves down toward him through 
the trees.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Clay tightens the cinch. Mary moves up to stand beside him.

MARY
Are we leaving?

CLAY
It's too light yet.

He swings into the saddle, pulls the rifle out of the scabbard 
and lays it across the pommel.

CLAY
Better go on back and get some more 
sleep. You'll need it later on.

MARY
(soberly)
You're not going out to look for 
them?

CLAY
No, I'm not. All I want 'em to do is 
keep ahead of us -- a long way ahead. 
So I'm riding up the line aways to 
pick us out a new trail.

He touches the mare with his spurs and trots down the hill. 
He disappears around a bend in the trail.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Mary, in the f.g., is staring after Clay. Helen is watching 
her. Steve has risen and walks up behind her. He smiles at 
her.

STEVE
Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. 
Don't worry about him.

MARY
(turning)
Oh, I wasn't worrying.
(flustered)
I saw him saddling up and thought he 
was ready to leave.

She starts down toward the wagon, Steve walking beside her 
and CAMERA TRUCKING WITH them THROUGH the forest.

STEVE
(softly)
You were worryin'.

Mary glances over.

STEVE
Sometimes not knowin' how to read 
has its points. You can't read books 
so you look at people and figure 'em 
out.

MARY
And you've got me all figured out?

STEVE
Sure.

They have passed Helen, playing solitaire on the canvas, and 
have reached the place where the grub box stands. Steve 
spreads a tarp for her.

STEVE
I'll fix us somethin' to eat.

Mary sits down. Steve opens the grub box and takes out some 
plates, tinned food and hardtack.

STEVE
Like when you were standin' there 
looking after Clay. I knew right off 
what you were thinking. Because I've 
been watching you.

MARY
You were supposed to be reading words.

STEVE
I was doin' both. Here.

He hands her a plate of food, takes another and goes over to 
Helen.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Helen looks up from her card game, takes the plate with a 
smile.

HELEN
Thanks, Steve.

He grins at her, turns and comes back to Mary who is watching 
him.

MARY
Better not let Clay catch you waitin' 
on us.

Steve sits on the edge of the grub box and picks up his plate.

STEVE
Don't pay any attention to him. That's 
his way and I've found he's sure 
easy to get along with. I don't 
recollect him havin' hit me more'n a 
couple of times and I guess I had it 
comin'.

MARY
But you're his brother.

STEVE
He'll treat his wife just as good. 
Maybe better. Ever see him use a 
bull snake on the mules like other 
wranglers?

Mary shakes her head.

STEVE
Yes sir, Clay's nice to be around.
(the clincher)
He don't chew much and when he does 
he spits outside.

HELEN
(dryly)
You make him sound wonderful... Go 
on. Tell Mary more about him.

Steve looks over at her, embarrassed, a little hurt by her 
tone. He rises, takes Mary's empty plate and his own and 
goes over to the little spring to wash them. Mary looks 
sharply at Helen. Helen shrugs. Mary rises and follows Steve 
over to the spring.

MED. CLOSE ON SPRING

Steve kneels by the little pool, washing the plates in the 
run off. Mary stops above him.

MARY
She was only teasin'.

STEVE
(offhand)
Oh, sure.

MARY
Let me do that.

She kneels beside him. Steve looks over at her.

STEVE
I like to do things for you. Didn't 
you know?

She looks down at the water bubbling up into the little moss 
lined pool.

MARY
(softly)
I know now.

DISSOLVE

EXT. TRAIL - NIGHT

CLOSE SHOT - DOWN ANGLE. O.s. there is the SOUND of the 
cavalcade moving. A wheel passes camera, then another. CAMERA 
PULLS BACK to reveal the wagon passing in the moonlit 
darkness. Mary is driving.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Clay rides into the shot, his rifle ready. The wagon follows. 
Then the remuda with Steve bringing up the rear. Steve also 
holds his rifle ready. Both men are wary, watchful, 
apprehensive.

DISSOLVE

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

FULL SHOT - DOWN ANGLE. SHOOTING DOWN THROUGH the leaves of 
a quaking aspen. The cavalcade moves on along the trail.

DISSOLVE

EXT. ROCKY HILLSIDE - DAWN

FULL SHOT. The east is grey with the approaching dawn. The 
terrain is treeless, forbidding. Granite crags rise all 
around. The trail leads up through a canyon then narrows 
along the edge of a cliff. The cavalcade toils forward. Clay, 
in the lead, stops and waits for the wagon to come abreast.

MED. SHOT

As the wagon comes abreast, Clay dismounts, loops the reins 
over the tail gate, then swings up into the seat, motioning 
for Mary to move over. He takes the reins, puts his rifle 
down in front of him.

MED. CLOSE - MOVING (PROCESS)

Clay and Mary. Helen is sleeping in the bed of the wagon.

MARY
Don't you trust me?

CLAY
Not on this trail, I don't. I've 
been over it before. Anyway, you 
ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't 
you climb in back.

Mary glances ahead.

MARY
I like to see where I'm going.

She picks up the rifle and holds it across her knees.

CLAY
(dryly)
Did you ever care where you were 
goin' or where you'd been?

Mary glances over at him wonderingly.

MARY
Maybe not! But I want to get there 
in one piece.

They ride along in silence for a moment. The trail is rough. 
The jolting wagon throws them together. Their shoulders touch.

MARY
(softly)
Why did you change your mind about 
bringing us along?

CLAY
Why do you think?

MARY
(soberly)
I don't know. I thought I did. Now 
I'm not sure. I thought it had 
something to do with me.

CLAY
Oh, it did. It had a great deal to 
do with you.

Mary studies him, trying to figure out what he means.

MARY
Just how do you mean that?

Clay is busy with driving down the rough road. He speaks 
without looking at her.

CLAY
You know so much about me -- figure 
it out.

MARY
So that's it --
(he glances over)
You think I was making fun of your 
girl in gingham.

CLOSE SHOT

Helen. She lies in the bed of the wagon, looking up.

MARY'S VOICE
I wasn't. And I wasn't making fun of 
you or your dream.

She waits for an answer, but getting none, continues.

MARY'S VOICE
Of course, maybe I was trying to get 
you to do something you didn't want 
to do.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - MOVING (PROCESS)

Clay and Mary. Clay busies himself with the brake and the 
reins.

CLAY
You wouldn't do a thing like that, 
would you?

MARY
(softly)
Yes. But -- that was the other night. 
Now -- I don't think I would.

MED. LONG SHOT - ANGLED AHEAD

Clay and Mary in f.g. The trail now goes down a slope to a 
river, which boils out of a narrow canyon, then follows the 
river through the canyon. Clay hands the reins to Mary, takes 
his rifle.

CLAY
That's the West Walker. Take it easy 
now.

MED. SHOT

Clay swings down. The wagon moves past him. He frees his 
horse, swings into the saddle and gallops down toward the 
canyon.

CLOSE SHOT

Mary. She looks after him.

FULL SHOT

The wagon moves down toward the river. Clay disappears into 
the canyon. Steve and the remuda follow the wagon.

EXT. CANYON TRAIL

ANGLED TOWARD mouth of canyon. Clay rides along the trail, 
his rifle at the ready. Now he moves warily, keeping a sharp 
lookout. The canyon is dark, sinister.

REVERSE SHOT

The cavalcade enters the canyon.

ANOTHER ANGLE - SHOOTING DOWN

Clay rides toward camera. The trail curves around a cliff.

MED. SHOT

Clay. He rides around the bend in the trail. He hears 
something. He reins the horse in. Some pebbles rattle down 
the cliff. He looks up.

FROM CLAY'S ANGLE

The muzzle of a rifle is visible. Clay starts to bring his 
gun up.

FOWLER'S VOICE
Hold it!

DOWN ANGLE

Clay lets his rifle rest across his knees. He looks up. 
Fowler, a well-set-up young man in jeans, blue shirt and 
worn jacket and wearing a battered hat, moves into scene.

CLOSE SHOT

Clay. He is wary, puzzled as to the man's identity. For all 
he knows it may be one of Lednov's men.

MED. SHOT

Clay and Fowler.

FOWLER
What are you doin' on this trail?

CLAY
Followin' it. Any reason I shouldn't?

MED. LONG SHOT

SHOOTING PAST Fowler. Into view comes the wagon and the 
remuda. Fowler lowers his rifle. He slides down the cliff to 
stand beside Clay.

MED. CLOSE

Clay and Fowler.

FOWLER
My name's Fowler. I'm camped up a 
ways.

He extends his hand. Clay shakes it.

CLAY
Clay Phillips of Aspen. Been havin' 
trouble?

FOWLER
Nope. But I don't want any.

CLAY
Neither do we. That's why we took 
this trail instead of the main road, 
and drove all night.

FOWLER
You're welcome to use my camp.

He motions ahead, starts walking. Clay rides beside him.

DISSOLVE

EXT. MEADOW

FULL SHOT. The river is beyond the meadow. In the pine forest 
at the edge of the meadow is Fowler's camp. The cavalcade is 
driving up to the camp. There are two horses tethered in the 
meadow.

EXT. FOWLER'S CAMP

MED. FULL SHOT. A tarp is stretched over the camp. There is 
a crude stone fireplace, a rough table and two benches. 
Shelves are nailed between the trees. In a small lean-to 
there is a bunk with Fowler's bedroll on it. Fowler stands 
watching Mary and Holen as they get out of the wagon. The 
horses sproad out across the meadow. Steve and Clay dismount. 
Both unsaddle. Helen, Mary and Fowler exchange glances. Then 
the two women walk toward the camp, which is behind a screen 
of trees.

MED. CLOSE ON CAMP

Helen and Mary enter the camp.

MARY
We might as well start a fire.

HELEN
Go ahead.
(nodding off)
Get in training for the pioneer life. 
I'm finding the nearest body of water 
and climbing into it.

She goes off and across the meadow. Mary looks after her, 
shrugs and going to the fireplace, takes moss and twigs from 
the pile and puts them in. Clay, carrying saddle bags and 
canteens, enters.

MARY
Got a light?

He puts them down, goes over to the fireplace and kneels to 
light the moss. Mary has stepped back.

CLOSE SHOT - LOW

As he lights the fire, the lower portion of Mary's body comes 
into the shot. Clay becomes aware of her closeness. He rises 
slowly. CAMERA ANGLES UP. Mary is standing facing him, almost 
touching him. They stare at each other without speaking. 
Both suddenly move togother. They kiss. There is a SOUND 
over shot and they step apart, looking off.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Steve has come into scene and is looking at them. He smiles 
with pleasure and surprise.

STEVE
(innocently)
Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?

CLAY
(upset)
Just the grub box and bed rolls.

Steve nods, smiles at both of them and goes out of scene. 
Clay and Mary face each other. Suddenly Clay swings around 
and goes out of shot after his brother.

CLOSE SHOT - MARY

She looks after him, clearly in love, disappointed that they 
were interrupted. Then she turns to the fire.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

Clay and Steve. CAMERA MOVES AHEAD of them as they walk toward 
the wagon. Steve has begun to whistle blithely. Clay looks 
sideways at him. Steve whistles even louder. They stop at 
the wagon. CAMERA HOLDS. Steve climbs inside and hands down 
the grub box.

STEVE
I -- I think it'll be swell.

Clay puts the grub box on the ground. Steve tosses out the 
bed rolls, then jumps out. He grins up at Clay.

MED. CLOSE

Clay, embarrassed, puts his hand on the boy's shoulder.

CLAY
When you get older you'll understand 
things better. Like women and men. 
Just because a man kisses a woman, 
doesn't always mean -- well, he can 
kiss her and not want to -- have her 
around all the time.

Steve watches him, puzzled. His exuberance has gone.

CLAY
We got a lot to do, you and I. Gettin' 
that ranch started and everything. 
We've been getting along fine, all 
these years. For a while I want to 
keep it the way it is.

Abruptly Clay turns and indicates the grub box. Steve watches 
him.

CLAY
Take that in and help her get 
breakfast, will you?

Steve nods and carries the grub box out of the scene. Clay 
stares after him. Then he picks up the bed roll and moves 
around the wagon.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Clay in the f.g. In front of Clay stretches the meadow with 
the river beyond. The horses are grazing in the meadow. Fowler 
can be seen hurrying toward the aspens and alders that screen 
the river.

EXT. RIVER BANK

MED. SHOT. Here the river moves quietly down. The bank is 
sandy. Alders and aspens screen it from the meadow. Helen 
sits on the sand taking off her shoes and stockings. Her 
toilet box is beside her. Something on the bank catches her 
attention, she rises and climbs the bank. Some branches of 
aspen cover an object. She pulls the branches away, revealing 
a crud, miner's cradle or rocker.

MED. CLOSE

Helen stares down at the cradle. She doesn't know what it 
is.

FOWLER'S VOICE
(sharp)
What are you doing down here?

Helen, startled, turns.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Fowler and Helen. They stare at each other.

FOWLER
(curt)
You got no business snoopin' around --

HELEN
(hard)
Me snoopin'? I came down here to 
take a bath.

She glances from Fowler to the cradle.

HELEN
That something I shouldn't see?

FOWLER
(flustered)
No. But it's mine and I didn't want 
anyone foolin' with it.

Hurriedly he covers it with branches again. Helen watches 
him, curious, interested.

HELEN
What is it?

FOWLER
Just a thing I was workin' on.

HELEN
The way you act, it must be something 
pretty secret.

When Fowler doesn't explain she moves on down the bank and 
sits on the sand.

FOWLER
Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.

HELEN
You wouldn't have a smoke on you, 
would you?

Fowler comes over and sits down beside her. He takes [a] 
sack of tobacco and papers from his pocket. She reaches for 
them. He watches her wide-eyed as she rolls a cigarette. He 
holds a match for her.

HELEN
Thanks.

She turns to the toilet case on the sand beside her, takes 
out a comb. He glances at the box, then reaches over and 
from it takes her powder box. He sniffs it. Without 
irritation, as though borrowing a toy from a child, Helen 
takes the powder box from him.

FOWLER
That sure smells good.

HELEN
I like it.

FOWLER
Up here in the hills, a man gets a 
hankering to smell powder.

HELEN
Then why stay in the hills.

She looks at him then up the bank where the cradle is.

HELEN
That why?

Fowler hesitates. Helen hands him back the powder box as 
matter-of-factly as she took it. He accepts it gratefully, 
again putting it to his nose. Now he looks up at her, 
regarding her calculatingly for a moment or two. Their eyes 
meet.

FOWLER
I guess you can keep a secret. That's 
a gold rocker. I'm doin' a little 
placer mining in a place nobody ever 
thought to look for gold before.

He reaches to his throat and lifts over his head a braided 
loop of rawhide. Attached to the loop is a small, plump, 
soft-leather poke. Still holding the powder box, he passes 
her the poke. She starts to work with the thong.

FOWLER
Look at her -- see her shine. One 
week's work.

Helen still struggles with the thong. He takes the poke, 
pulls it open, pouring grains of gold into his palm. Helen 
looks at the shining heap in his hand. Then she takes the 
poke and pours some of the grains in her own palm. She looks 
down at it. Her expression is calculating. She looks up at 
Fowler and then the hard look goes away. She gives him a 
soft smile.

DISSOLVE

EXT. MEADOW

CLOSE SHOT - DOWN ANGLE. Mary is asleep in the shade of a 
pine. She lies on a tarp using a folded blanket for a pillow. 
It is very quiet. She stirs, opens her eyes. Her expression 
changes. A soft smile plays around her lips as CAMERA ANGLE 
WIDENS and we see Clay sitting near her, leaning against the 
bole of a pine. He isn't looking at her. Mary watches him 
for a moment.

MARY
(softly)
Roll me a cigarette, Clay.

Clay looks over at her. Then rising he moves closer, squats 
and rolls a cigarette. He holds it out. She licks it, then 
puts it in her mouth. Clay lights a match, holds it out. She 
catches his hand and holds the flame to her cigarette.

MARY
Thanks.

She still holds his hand. They look at each other.

MARY
Why didn't you wake me?

Clay doesn't answer.

MARY
You should have. I don't like leaving 
things unfinished.

CLAY
(quiet)
Maybe it's better that way.

MARY
(intense)
You don't mean that Clay.

She holds his hand, smiling up. Clay hesitates, then desire 
for her is more than he can bear, so he takes her in his 
arms. They kiss, holding the kiss for a long while.

ANOTHER ANGLE

They break. She lies looking up. He half lies, half sits 
beside her.

MARY
(a whisper)
Tell me, darling.

CLAY
What?

MARY
What does a man usually tell a girl?

For answer, Clay kisses her again -- hard, ruthlessly. His 
hands crush her shoulders. Mary holds the kiss for a moment, 
then draws back, waiting for him to say the words she wants 
to hear. His hands pull her toward him. Mary wants the kiss -- 
but she also wants a declaration of love. She makes one last 
try to get it.

MARY
Tell me -- please --

Clay's grip on her shoulders tightens. She searches his face 
with a glance -- stares into his eyes -- then pushes him 
away and sits up.

CLOSE SHOT

Mary. She is hurt by his silence.

MARY
All right you don't love me. So let 
it go at that.

CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS. Clay's expression hardens. He drops his 
hands from her shoulders.

CLAY
What did you expect? Speeches I don't 
mean?

MARY
I don't expect anything. A minute 
ago I hadn't cuite waked up.

She stands. He rises to face her.

MARY
I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you 
want to say. I'll listen.

CLAY
If it's pretty speeches you want, 
you won't be hearing them. Even when 
I mean 'em, they don't come easy.

MARY
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. 
Just tell me I'm not good enough for 
you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't 
change.

CLAY
All right -- it's said!

MARY
Then let's get started. The sooner I 
get to Sonora, the better I'll like 
it.

Turning she starts down toward camp.

MED. LONG SHOT

ANGLED PAST Clay. Below is the camp. Beyond the camp, through 
the trees, stands the wagon and Steve is hitching up the 
mules. Clay hesitates, then follows.

CLOSE TRUCKING SHOT

Mary. Tears form in her eyes. She blinks them away, composing 
herself with an effort.

EXT. CAMP

MED. SHOT - Helen and Fowler in f.g. Helen sits at one side 
of the table, Fowler on the other. Helen holds the soft 
leather poke. In the b.g. Mary approaches. Behind her comes 
Clay.

HELEN
You're sure there's more where this 
came from?

FOWLER
Plenty more.
(motioning)
And somewhere up there's the lode, 
the rock rotten with it.

Helen pours the gold out in her palm as Mary comes up. Mary 
stands looking down.

HELEN
Pretty, isn't it? And all you have 
to do is shovel sand into a thing 
and the river does the work.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Clay enters the scene and goes over to pick up his saddle 
bags.

MARY
(quiet)
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.

HELEN
Maybe you are. I'm not.

She reaches over and pats Fowler's hand.

HELEN
I'm stayin' here with Jed.

Mary looks from Helen to Fowler.

FOWLER
(shyly)
I figure we'll get along just fine.

HELEN
Well cheer, why don't you? No more 
responsibilities, Mary. Marcia -- 
Elaine -- me -- all taken care of. 
Down there feeding horses and raising 
kids, you won't have a thing to worry 
about.

Mary stands looking down at Helen. Lovingly Helen pours the 
gold back in the poke.

MARY
I'm not raising horses or kids for 
anybody. I'm opening the slickest 
gambling house in California with a 
crystal chandelier, the biggest you 
ever saw --

Clay, saddle bags in hand, straightens. Mary directs the 
rest of the speech at him.

MARY
-- Gaslights and a dance floor and a 
big bar. Cash registers with bells 
and a couple of boys with armbands 
just to keep 'em ringing. What do 
you think of that?

HELEN
Sounds fine. Only that isn't how 
it's going to be.

Helen juggles the poke in her hand.

HELEN
I'm sure of this. But not of you.
(shakes head)
You won't open any joint. I've been 
watching you change. You're mad now 
and you think you can change back. 
But you can't. You'll end up making 
beds in a boarding house.

MARY
(furious)
That's it then.

FOWLER
(the master)
That's it. She's staying with me -- 
for keeps.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Steve has entered the camp and is standing looking at them 
open-mouthed. Mary moves over to Fowler and holds out her 
hand.

MARY
If there were more men like you, 
there wouldn't be so many of us.

FOWLER
Thanks.

MARY
It's nice to meet a man who doesn't 
want to own a woman from the day she 
was born. I never had the luck. The 
only kind I've run into were tramps 
or dirty-minded hypocrites.

Clay moves up beside Mary.

MED. CLOSE

Clay, Mary and Fowler.

CLAY
(to Fowler)
She's aimin' at me, but her aim's 
bad.
(to Mary)
Want to know why I changed my mind 
about bringing you? Because I talked 
to Elaine -- because I was afraid to 
leave you with decent people, that's 
why. And you'll open your joint all 
right. You wouldn't fit anywhere 
else.

He moves on past her, motions to Steve.

CLAY
Let's round up the horses.

Steve hesitates.

CLAY
(sharp)
Come on -- we don't want to keep the 
people in Sonora waiting.

He stalks away, followed by Steve. Mary turns and looks after 
him.

CLOSE SHOT

Mary. She wants to break windows.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

Mary, Fowler and Helen. Helen is staring at Mary. She crosses 
to her and puts her arm around her shoulders.

HELEN
Mary, Honey. I talked too much, like 
always -- he thinks you told Elaine 
the things I told her.

MARY
(furious)
I don't care what he thinks.

Mary throws her arm off and moves after Clay and Steve. Helen 
looks at Fowler and shrugs.

MED. SHOT

the wagon. As Mary hurries up to stand by the tail gate, 
Clay and Steve, now mounted, spur their horses and start 
across the meadow.

CLOSE SHOT

Mary. She stares after them, raging. Then she glances at the 
wagon.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Mary in f.g. The mulos stand in their traces, waiting. Mary 
makes up her mind what to do. Climbing into the bed, she 
heaves out pack saddles, bed rolls, ropes, etc. Clay and 
Stove can be seen in b.g. riding down toward where the horses 
graze.

MED. SHOT

ANGLED TOWARD camp. Into the scene come pack saddles, bed 
rolls. Helen and Fowler, in b.g., walk toward the wagon.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

wagon. Mary straightens, looks off, then climbs into the 
seat and picks up the reins and the whip. She lashes the 
mules with the whip. CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS. The mules jump and 
gallop off. Fowler and Helen come into the scene.

ANOTHER ANGLE

the wagon, pulled by the galloping mules, is disappearing in 
a cloud of dust.

MED. SHOT

the meadow. Clay and Steve have almost reached the horses. 
Steve turns.

STEVE
Clay -- look!

Clay swings around.

LONG SHOT

their ANGLE. Mary drives the wagon around a bend in the trail.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

ON Clay. He glances after Mary, then reins his horse around 
and gallops after her, CAMERA PANNING WITH him.

EXT. TRAIL

MOVING SHOT. Mary drives the wagon along the trail. Ahead 
beyond the river, the mountains rise. The river is running 
bank full. The trail leads down to a rocky, dangerous bank. 
Mary pulls the mules in at the bank.

CLOSE SHOT

Mary. She looks toward the river. She is frightened, about 
to abandon the whole foolish enterprise. She glances back.

LONG SHOT

FROM Mary's ANGLE. Clay gallops around a bend in the trail.

CLOSE SHOT

Mary. She looks in Clay's direction, then turns and stares 
at the river.

MED. SHOT

ANGLED PAST Mary. She makes up her mind to go through with 
it and lashes the mules with the whip. CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS. 
The mules balk when they reach the river. Mary lashes them 
again. They jump forward into the torrent.

REVERSE SHOT

Clay gallops toward the river. Steve comes around the bend 
in the trail.

MED. FULL SHOT

the river. The mules flounder, start swimming. The current 
catches the wagon. It starts drifting downstream. Mary whips 
the mules. They swim, the current pulls them. Then the wagon 
goes over. Mary is thrown into the water. The mules kick 
themselves free and swim to the other bank. Mary goes under, 
comes up and starts swimming desperately. Clay rides into 
the SHOT. His mare hesitates at the bank. Clay spurs her and 
she plunges in. Mary's belongings can be seen floating down 
the river.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Clay swims his horse toward Mary who is floundering in the 
stream.

CLOSE SHOT

Mary. The current sweeps her against a rock. Stunned -- she 
goes under.

MED. SHOT

Clay swims his horse to her, reaches down and lifts her up 
in front of him.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Clay's horse, with the double burden, fights her way out of 
the stream and scrambles up the bank to stop on level ground.

MED. CLOSE

Clay and Mary. Clay, his expression anxious, stares down at 
the stunned Mary. He swings out of the saddle, holding her 
tenderly to him. The brush with death has made him realize 
how much she means to him. Gently, he puts her down on the 
sand, stoops beside her.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Clay and Mary in f.g. Steve swims his horse across and rides 
up the bank to dismount near them.

CLAY
Mary --

MED. CLOSE - DOWN ANGLE

Mary opens her eyes and sits up

CLAY
(anxiously)
Are you all right?

Mary is humiliated, bedraggled and wet, still angry and 
fighting back tears.

MARY
(sharp)
No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked 
and I hit myself against that rock.

CLAY
(nettlod at her tone)
I suppose that's my fault.

Mary gets to her feet. CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS. Steve stands in 
the b.g. She looks out at the river.

MARY
(wailing)
All my clothes --

CLAY
That's right -- worry about your 
clothes --

ANOTHER ANGLE

to include wagon in river. Clay, suddenly furious, points to 
the wagon.

CLAY
What about my wagon. Of all the crazy 
fool things to do. You lose a man's 
wagon because you're stupid and then 
yell about your clothes.

This is the last straw. Mary turns her back, digs into her 
stocking and pulls out some bills. She hands them to him.

MARY
For the wagon.

Clay looks at Mary, then down at the money.

MARY
Go on, take it. Then you can't spend 
the rest of the trip expecting to 
get paid.

CLAY
(furious)
There won't be any rest of the trip. 
Over the hill is a stage road and 
when we hit it you get dumped into 
the first stage that comes along. So 
keep your money. You'll need it for 
the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was 
fed up with you before we started.

He turns and sees Steve standing scowling at him. He takes 
the rest of his anger out on Steve.

CLAY
Don't just stand there. Go on back 
and get the packs on the horses. 
We've lost all the time we're going 
to because of a woman.

Clay strides over to his horse and swings into the saddle. 
Steve stands looking at Mary.

CLAY
Come on. Didn't you hear me?

As he plunges his horse into the stream:

DISSOLVE

EXT. RIVER

FULL SHOT - the lower ford. Where the main road crosses the 
river, it flows gently, with sand banks on either side. Three 
horsemen appear around a bend in the trail and ride down to 
the riverbank. They are Lednov, McCall and Peters. Lednov's 
horse is limping badly. They ride into the river.

REVERSE ANGLE

The horses swim to shore and flounder up the bank, Lednov's 
horse last. As the horse starts up the bank Lednov sees 
something o.s. and reins the horse in.

MED. SHOT

FROM Lednov's ANGLE. A piece of clothing floats down the 
river. Lednov rides down the bank into the water. He reaches 
down awkwardly and gets the piece of clothing, then turns 
and rides back up the bank.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The two others have turned and are watching him. He rides up 
to them, holding out one of Mary's undergarments.

MCCALL
We got company. Female company.

LEDNOV
(looking at the garment)
Yeah, we sure have.

He turns to scan the river.

ANGLED PAST THEM - AT RIVER

Mary's trunk comes floating by. The three men look at each 
other, then Lednov turns his horse and starts up the bank of 
the river. The others follow.

DISSOLVE

EXT. PEAKS OF THE SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS

EXTREME LONG SHOT. The long pine-covered approaches, and the 
glistening summit; the early snow covering the rocks with a 
thin layer of white. CAMERA PANS DOWN FROM the heights of 
the mountains, TO the narrow trail that winds among the trees. 
Clay passes, and behind him the pack-horses and the romuda. 
Following the remuda comes Mary. She is dressed in a pair of 
Steve's pants and wears one of his shirts under her own coat.

MED. SHOT

Mary, as she swings with the movement of the horse. She is 
tired. She wears no makeup. But she looks as unaffectedly 
beautiful as we have ever seen her.

MED. FULL SHOT

the trail. It turns steeply, doubling back, and new Clay is 
directly above her. He looks down at her, but she disregards 
his glance. We feel that he might speak, but her cold 
restraint prevents him. The wind whistles through the trees. 
The slow plodding noise of the horses becomes more distant.

DISSOLVE

EXT. UPPER FORD - NIGHT - MOONLIGHT

MED. FULL SHOT. Lednov, McCall and Peters ride slowly through 
the brush to where the trail enters the river. Downstream, 
wedged in the rocks is the wagon. The three men look at the 
wagon, then turn to look back along the trail.

LONG SHOT

their ANGLE. Fowler's campfire flickers through the trees.

MED. CLOSE

the three men. They look at each other. Lednov motions in 
the direction of Fowler's camp. They start back along the 
trail.

EXT. MEADOW - NIGHT

FULL SHOT. The three men ride along the trail toward the 
camp. Through the trees the campfire flickers.

EXT. FOWLER'S CAMP - NIGHT

MED. SHOT. Fowler is putting the supper dishes up on the 
shelves beside the fireplace. The camp is cleaner than it 
was earlier in the day. It is evident that he has gone to 
great pains to make his visitor comfortable.

A mirror has been tacked up on a tree, and under it is a 
wash basin. Fowler's rifle and shotgun are in a rack near 
the fireplace. Helen's trunk stands open near the lean-to. 
Helen, wearing a robe, takes some clothing from it, closes 
the trunk.

HELEN
You can put this out of the way, 
Jed. It's empty.

Fowler turns and smiles. Helen pushes through the curtains 
into the lean-to. Fowler puts the last of the dishes on the 
shelf, crosses to the trunk and moves it over to the side of 
the lean-to. Turning to go back to the fireplace, he stops.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Fowler in the f.g. Lednov, rifle in hand, stands just inside 
the camp on the meadow side.

FOWLER
(turning slowly)
What do you want?

Lednov moves slowly forward to stand near the table. He looks 
around him. Fowler starts slowly toward the fireplace.

LEDNOV
I saw your fire and dropped by to 
say hello.

FOWLER
Well, say it.

Trying to be casual, Fowler moves closer to where the guns 
are racked.

LEDNOV
What's the matter -- restless?

FOWLER
Yes, people make me restless.

LEDNOV
Even women?

FOWLER
There aren't any women here.

LEDNOV
I suppose that's your wagon in the 
river.

FOWLER
Some people who went by this way 
lost it.
(nervously)
Two men and some women. They packed 
their stuff on horses and went on.

LEDNOV
And you're all alone.

FOWLER
Yeah.

He has edged closer to the gun rack. Lednov seems unaware 
that he is near the guns. His interest is centered on the 
lean-to. He moves to the entrance, stands with his hand on 
the canvas.

LEDNOV
Suppose I take a look.

FOWLER
Go ahead.

Lednov pulls back the flap. His back is to Fowler, who starts 
quickly for the tree, only to stop as McCall comes out from 
behind it.

MCCALL
Looking for something?

Fowler drops his hands to his side. Lednov turns, grins at 
Fowler, and enters the lean-to.

INT. LEAN-TO - NIGHT

The shelter is dark. Lednov strikes a match and looks around. 
The place is empty. There is a bunk, made up. On the left 
hand wall a curtain of gunny sacks covers the clothes hanging 
there. The match burns down to Lednov's fingers. There is a 
SOUND of a scuffle outside a blow, and a groan. Lednov drops 
the match and hurries out.

EXT. CAMP - NIGHT

Lednov comes out of the lean-to. Fowler is sprawled by the 
table. McCall stands over him, rifle raised.

LEDNOV
Hold it, Mac.

EXT. BACK OF LEAN-TO - NIGHT

MED. CLOSE SHOT. Helen stands flattened against a tree.

LEDNOV'S VOICE
Get up.

Cautiously Helen starts moving away.

EXT. CAMP - NIGHT

MED. SHOT. Fowler pulls himself to his feet. Mac stands near 
him.

LEDNOV
Come on. Where'd the women go?

Fowler sinks on a bench, his head in his hands. Lednov moves 
closer.

LEDNOV
When I ask questions, I like to hear 
answers.

FOWLER
They went on like I told you.

EXT. FOREST - MOONLIGHT

MED. SHOT. Helen cautiously moves away from the camp.

LEDNOV'S VOICE
How long ago?

FOWLER
Five, six hours.

A twig snaps underfoot. Helen freezes.

EXT. CAMP - NIGHT

MED. SHOT. Lednov is staring off in the direction of Helen. 
McCall moves to the edge of the lean-to, looking off.

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

MED. CLOSE SHOT. Helen starts forward again, more cautiously 
than ever. She reaches a tree, turns to look back.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Helen, back to camera, is in immediate f.g. Through the trees 
can be seen the camp and the flickering fire. She turns, and 
then fright comes into her expression.

REVERSE SHOT

Peters stands in front of her. As he reaches out for her, 
she tries to get away. He grabs her, wrapping his arms around 
her.

EXT. CAMP - NIGHT

MED. SHOT. From o.s. comes the SOUND of Helen and Peters 
struggling. Fowler, hearing the SOUND, gets to his feet. 
Lednov and McCall turn on him.

LEDNOV
Sit down.
(calling)
All right, Peters, come on over here.

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

MED. SHOT. Peters, carrying the struggling Helen, heads for 
the camp.

EXT. CAMP - NIGHT

ANOTHER ANGLE. Fowler makes a futile dive for Lednov. McCall 
swings his rifle. Fowler goes down. In the b.g. Peters drags 
the struggling Helen around the lean-to into the camp.

LEDNOV
(to Fowler)
So you were all alone.

He moves forward to meet Helen and Peters. Lednov reaches 
out for Helen. Peters pulls her away.

PETERS
(sharp)
You keep your hands off.

McCall has taken his attention from Fowler and gives it to 
Helen. Unnoticed now, Fowler is struggling back to 
consciousness. He tries to pull himself up. McCall turns 
back and kicks him again.

HELEN
(yelling)
Let him alone!

She rakes Peters' face with her fingernails, tries to fight 
free. Lednov reaches out and grabs her arm. Peters knocks 
his arm down. Free for the moment, Helen launches an attack 
on McCall, who is getting ready to boot Fowler again. She is 
on him like a cat, swarming all over him. He defends himself. 
Helen is yelling furiously as she fights McCall.

HELEN
Kick a guy, would you! You scum! You 
won't do any kickin' when they come 
back.

Lednov has reached her now. He wraps his arms around her and 
pulls her away from McCall. Helen tries to fight him.

HELEN
You dirty murderers... killin' people 
when they're sleepin'...

Lednov pinions her arms.

LEDNOV
How do you know who we are?

HELEN
Everybody knows --

LEDNOV
(excited)
Who brought you here?

Helen doesn't answer. Lednov starts twisting her arms.

LEDNOV
You said somebody was comin' back -- 
who's comin' back?

HELEN
(moaning)
Stop it --

As the pain increases she blurts out Clay's name.

HELEN
Clay Phillips.

LEDNOV
Where is he?

HELEN
Up the trail.

In a fury, Lednov crushes her arm.

LEDNOV
How far up the trail?

HELEN
(moaning)
I don't know -- I don't know.

He hurls her from him. She goes back against the table. Fowler 
is trying to struggle to his feet. In blind rage, Lednov 
raises his gun and fires. Fowler crumples. Helen looks down, 
too horrified and terrified to scream. Lednov looks at her, 
then almost casually he shoots her. McCall and Peters stand 
watching as though frozen.

PETERS
(huskily)
You didn't have to do that.

LEDNOV
(deadly)
Why not? She might have got to Clay 
Phillips before I did.

AS HE TURNS,

FADE OUT

EXT. OPEN RIDGE FADE IN

MED. FULL SHOT - ANGLES east. Behind the ridge rises the 
range through which the pass to Nevada cuts its way. The 
trail which has dipped down into a canyon comes up to follow 
the ridge a ways and then drops down again. Lednov, McCall 
and Peters ride along the trail. Lednov, in the lead, stops 
suddenly and looks off.

EXTREME LONG SHOT

DOWN ANGLE from Lednov's point of view. Far below is a meadow 
and crossing it is a wagon road. This is the road from 
Yosemite to Sonora. The road comes down the hill to the south 
and, as the forest is open at this point, anything approaching 
along the road can be seen for some distance. It crosses the 
meadow and continues into the northwest. In the meadow is a 
snake-rail corral. Clay's pack train comes out of the woods 
above the meadow and starts down.

MED. SHOT

McCall, Lednov and Peters. Lednov motions to his men and 
they hurriedly ride forward into the shelter of some trees.

MED. SHOT

the pack train. Mary, half asleep, slumps forward. Her horse 
has stopped. Steve rides up alongside and looks over at her, 
anxiously.

STEVE
Are you all right?

Mary starts into wakefulness. She smiles at Steve.

MARY
For the last ten miles I've been 
trying to figure out how to sleep 
sitting up. I'm getting to the point 
where I don't think there's any place 
named Sonora.

STEVE
It's a long ways yet.
(arrogantly, to Clay)
I figure we ought to camp. She's 
tired.

CLAY
So am I and so are the horses.

He rides on ahead. Steve looks after him, annoyed, then 
follows with Mary.

EXT. MEADOW

Clay leads the pack train out into the clearing and toward 
the road. A small creek threads its way through the meadow. 
Clay rides up to the creek and swings out of the saddle. He 
is taking the saddle off as the others ride up.

CLAY
(to Steve)
Take the packs off. And run the horses 
into the corral.

He throws the saddle down, takes his rifle out of the 
scabbard. Steve doesn't move.

CLAY
I said take the packs off.

He starts off past Mary, glances up.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

Mary leans wearily forward on the pommel, too tired to 
dismount.

CLAY
(gruffly)
I figure we'll make better time, 
letting the horses rest for a spell.

Mary looks down at him. She is hoping he will reach up and 
lift her down.

CLAY
So grab yourself some sleep while 
you have the chance.

MARY
If you want to go on, I can make it 
all right.

CLAY
Like I said, I was thinkin' of the 
horses.

He turns a way abruptly and goes toward the road. Mary looks 
after him, disappointed. Steve comes over and helps her down.

MED. SHOT

Steve and Mary. Steve spreads a tarp on the grass.

STEVE
You stretch out. I'll fix something 
to eat.

MARY
(sitting)
Thanks, Steve.

Steve goes back and starts unpacking the horses. Mary looks 
off in Clay's direction, then stretches out and pillows her 
head on her arm. Now the sun is coming up and driving the 
darkness out of the meadow. In the distance Clay can be seen 
climbing up on a rise.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

Clay. He climbs up on an eminence and looks back toward the 
hills.

LONG SHOT

his ANGLE. The open ridge. There is no sign of Lednov.

ANGLED PAST CLAY

INTO the meadow. Steve has unpacked the horses. They graze 
inside the crude corral. Steve is collecting wood for a fire. 
Clay hurries down toward him.

MED. SHOT

Steve squats beside the pile of needles, twigs and pine cones. 
He strikes a match and sets the needles aflame. Clay hurries 
into the scene and roughly kicks the fire out. Steve rises.

CLAY
(angrily)
If you want 'em to find us, why don't 
you go up on the hill and wave your 
shirt or fire your rifle.

Steve is ashamed of his thoughtlessness and for a moment is 
apologetic.

STEVE
I didn't stop to think, Clay.

CLAY
(short)
You better start.

Clay turns and goes over to where the packs lie. He kneels 
beside the pack, rummages in them for hardtack and tinned 
food. Steve looks after him.

CLOSE SHOT

Steve. He is hurt and angry. Knowing he was in the wrong 
about the fire doesn't help matters. He'd like to go off in 
the woods and cry, but that's out of the question. Instead 
he follows Clay and stands above him.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

STEVE
Maybe you and me better split up 
when we hit Sonora.

Clay speaks without looking up.

CLAY
(mildly)
All right, I hurt your feelings. But 
you know better than to go lightin' 
fires.

STEVE
That ain't why. I just figure it's 
about time to start runnin' my own 
life.

Clay spreads the food on a tarp, sits down and starts eating 
a hardtack.

CLAY
Maybe you're not hungry, but I am.

Steve stares down at him angrier, more hurt than ever.

CLAY
Come on. We got a couple hours to 
eat and get some sleep.

STEVE
I'll eat when I'm good and ready.

CLAY
Kind of feeling your oats this 
morning. I haven't laid a hand on 
you for quite a while, but that 
doesn't mean you're too old.

STEVE
What makes you think you're so 
almighty? Telling people what to do 
and how to act when you don't even 
know how yourself.

[As this scene continues, there is heard, faintly o.s. the 
SOUND of little bells, the kind that teamsters put on the 
hames of their horses. Over the hill, in the direction of 
Yosemite, a stage is approaching. It is coming slowly uphill. 
Soon it will be visible on the rise about a mile south of 
the meadow.]

ANOTHER ANGLE

SHOOTING TOWARD Steve and Clay PAST Mary. She is asleep.

STEVE
You ain't even man enough to own up 
when you're wrong.

Clay rises and stands facing Steve.

STEVE
Go on, hit me.

CLAY
Sit down and eat. Till I say the 
word, you're doing what you're told.

STEVE
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's 
what you oughta do.

CLAY
You keep your nose out of my life, 
young fella.

STEVE
Maybe I haven't lived as long as you 
have, but I know a sight more about 
people and I wouldn't talk to a mule 
like you talked to her and, if I 
did, I'd say how sorry I was. I'd be 
man enough to do that.

Steve's voice rises during this speech. In f.g. Mary stirs 
and opens her eyes. Then she sits up.

CLAY
I said keep your nose out of my life. 
No kid is going to tell me how to 
run it.

STEVE
You think you're so slmighty -- smart -- 
Who are you to sit up there and say 
nobody's good enough for you, like 
you said yesterday -- just because a 
man kisses a woman --

Mary has risen. She is listening to Steve. She is also 
listening to the bells.

LONG SHOT

her ANGLE. Over the rise comes the stage. It is still a long 
way off.

STEVE'S VOICE
-- doesn't mean he wants to marry 
her.

ANOTHER ANGLE

to include all three. The brothers still don't see Mary.

STEVE
Well, if you didn't mean it, why did 
you kiss her?

Clay is ashamed but won't show it. He puts his hand on Steve's 
shoulder and pushes him.

CLAY
Shut up and eat.

Steve swings for his chin. Clay ducks the blow, grabs Steve's 
wrist. Steve swings with his left, hitting Clay ineffectually. 
Clay pins Steve's arms to his side.

MARY
(sharply)
Stop it -- both of you.

She walks toward them as Clay releases Steve and steps back. 
Steve puts his hands up, making ready for another round.

MARY
I won't have you fighting over me.

CLAY
(to Steve)
I'm sorry.

STEVE
You don't know what it is to be sorry.

MARY
(sharp)
Steve --

Steve turns abruptly and moves away. He is on the verge of 
tears.

MARY
(to Clay)
Mind sortin' out my things -- I'm 
leaving.

She motions off. Clay is suddenly aware of the approaching 
stage. He looks in that direction.

LONG SHOT

FROM his ANGLE. The stage drives along the road.

MARY
Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but 
it's going somewhere, which is all 
right with me.

CLAY
It's going to Sonora.

MARY
Fine -- maybe I'll see you there 
sometime.

She turns and starts going through the kyacks, looking for 
her things. Clay frowns down at her.

MARY
Because as you said, that's where I 
belong.

Mary's attention is on the kyacks. From where Clay stands 
near her he can see the trail leading down through open 
country toward the meadow.

CLAY
I said a lot of things -- some of 
'em --

Something o.s. catches his attention, then he pauses to look 
off.

EXT. TRAIL

LONG SHOT - his ANGLE. Up on the ridge there is the flash of 
sun on metal.

EXT. RIDGE

MED. SHOT. Lednov, McCall and Peters ride through the trees.

CLOSE SHOT

Clay. He looks up anxiously, then turns. CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS 
to include Mary and she straightens and faces him, her back 
to the trail.

MARY
Some of 'em you didn't mean but most 
of 'em you did. I don't blame you 
because I understand your way of 
thinking and why you think that way. 
You want your women on pedestals. 
But they have to be born on 'em -- 
they can fall off but they can't 
climb back up.

CLAY
(sharply)
I can't help how I think. You're 
trained a certain way when you're a 
kid and you can't change.

He bends down and picks up her things.

CLAY
If you're gonna catch this stage, 
come on.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The stage has speeded up and is coming fast down the road. 
Mary looks up at Clay hurt and shocked by his sudden 
sharpness. She had hoped he wouldn't let her go.

MARY
I can't change either. Not unless 
somebody wants me enough to give me 
a hand.

CLAY
Hurry up.

He starts off, Mary following.

MED. CLOSE TRUCKING SHOT

Mary makes one last attempt to get him to change his mind.

MARY
(softly)
I'm fool enough to believe that one 
of these days somebody will. Somebody 
who wants me as I am will maybe walk 
into the place where I'm working and 
take me out of there.

CLAY
Maybe they will.

He waves for the stage to stop.

ANGLED PAST STAGE

The driver sees Clay waving and pulls the horses in. The 
stage moves down to the edge of the meadow.

MED. SHOT

The stage. It is a small one, a double-seated buckboard with 
one woman passenger and the driver an elderly man. On the 
side of the vehicle is painted: "Yosemite-Sonora Stage Line". 
The woman, middle-aged and rather drab, looks at Mary 
curiously.

CLAY
Mind giving a lady a lift into town?

DRIVER
(to Mary)
Climb right in.

He jumps out of the stage and follows Clay, carrying Mary's 
belongings, around back of the stage. Mary gets into the 
stage beside the woman who moves over for her.

ANOTHER ANGLE

on back of stage. The driver opens the boot and Clay hands 
him Mary's belongings. He starts stowing them in the boot.

CLAY
Will you be seeing the sheriff?

DRIVER
Depot's right next to his office.

Clay starts scribbling a note. In the b.g. Steve has moved 
up beside the stage. He stands looking up at Mary.

MED. CLOSE

featuring Mary and Steve.

STEVE
(shyly)
Goodbye, ma'am.

Mary reaches down and takes his hand.

MARY
(quietly)
Goodbye, Steve. Don't fight with him 
any more.

Steve's expression hardens. He glances toward the back of 
the stage, then at Mary.

MARY
It's not his fault, just you remember 
that. It's mine. Don't ask me why 
because you couldn't understand now. 
Some day you will.

Clay and the driver come around the stage. Steve steps back. 
The driver climbs into the seat. Clay and Mary look at each 
other.

MARY
Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.

CLAY
Goodbye, Mary.

MARY
By the way, if you ever go past the 
Wyatt ranch, have another talk with 
Elaine.

Before Clay can speak, the driver snaps his whip and the 
stage jerks away down the road. Mary doesn't look back. Clay, 
in f.g., looks after it. Dust rises. It disappears around a 
bend in the road. Clay turns and starts across the meadow. 
Steve looks after Clay, hesitates, then follows.

MED. CLOSE

as Clay reaches the spot where the kyacks and saddles are 
thrown. Steve comes up to him.

STEVE
You know what she asked me?

CLAY
I don't care what she asked you.

STEVE
She told me not to fight with you 
anymore. She said it wasn't your 
fault, but -- I figure different...

Clay is looking off, hardly listening.

STEVE
It is so your fault and... and I 
guess maybe when we hit the ranch... 
you andme better...

CLAY
(sharply)
You want to split up? --

Clay's eyes are narrow, peering toward:

EXT. ROCKY HILLSIDE - DAY

LONG SHOT (Clay's ANGLE) of the shadowed slope. Something 
moves, indistinct, and then the sun catches a gun barrel as 
it disappears.

MED. CLOSE

Clay and Steve as Clay turns sharply.

CLAY
-- Why wait? Go on, saddle up now 
and beat it.

Steve looks over toward the horses, stalling.

STEVE
Half of them are mine.

CLAY
(hard)
You'll get your share. Go on. I don't 
want you around.

Turning, he crosses to where Steve's horse stands. CAMERA 
ANGLE WIDENS. He loads the horse back, throws a blanket and 
saddle on and cinches up the saddle. Steve watches, angry 
and hurt. Clay steps back.

CLAY
There you are.

MED. CLOSE

the two brothers. They stare at each other. Steve is on the 
verge of tears. Hurriedly, he swings into the saddle.

MED. SHOT

He glances down to Clay and digs his spurs in and gallops 
after the stage. Clay's stern expression leaves his face. He 
looks after the boy, smiles softly and then starts carrying 
the pack-saddle into the shelter of the forest.

in, then glances back.

MED. CLOSE

Clay and Steve. Steve takes down the bars and puts the horse 
in the corral. Clay comes up to him as he's putting the bars 
back up.

CLAY
What did you come back for?

STEVE
Like I told you, half those horses 
are mine. I'm makin' sure they get 
to the ranch safe. So let's quit 
arguing and do whatever you figure 
on doin'.

The two brothers stare at each other.

CLAY
(softly)
Is that the only reason you came 
back?

STEVE
(gruff)
Sure. What other reason would there 
be?

CLAY
(smiling)
I just wondered. Let's go.

EXT. MEADOW

LONG SHOT - DOWN ANGLE. Above the pines smoke rises. The 
horses graze inside the corral. In the shadowy forest by the 
creek, Clay's camp can be seen. A tarp has been stretched 
over the camp. Lednov moves into the right hand side of the 
frame and looks down.

REVERSE SHOT

Lednov stands on a rocky hill looking down in the meadow. 
Behind him are McCall and Peters. They are screened from the 
meadow by the rocks. Lednov turns and starts off through the 
rocks to circle above the camp. The two men follow. All are 
on foot.

EXT. ROCK

LONG SHOT SHOOTING PAST Clay and along his rifle. Clay, hidden 
behind a wall of rock, is watching the trail where it comes 
down into the meadow. Something moves on the rocky hill above 
and to his left. He looks up, waiting. The movement stops. 
Clay glances around.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Below Clay, Steve lies in a cut in the rocks, watching the 
camp. Clay motions toward the hill. Steve nods.

the sudden flight of the birds.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Below is the camp. Lednov motions.

LEDNOV
(to Peters)
Go on down and have a look.

PETERS
(scoffing)
And get my head blown off! Not me.

Lednov looks at McCall. From his pocket, McCall takes a coin.

MCCALL
Call it.

PETERS
Heads.

McCall flips the coin, shows it to Peters. Peters shrugs and 
starts moving cautiously down toward the camp.

MED. CLOSE

Lednov and McCall.

LEDNOV
And you! Get going.

McCall moves off to circle around in back of where Clay and

he brings one of the horses into the beads of the sights. It

Come on out, Phillips.

His voice echoes again and again. Clay's answer is a shot. 
It cuts the branches above Lednov's head.

CLOSE SHOT

MED. SHOT

his ANGLE. A light wind runs through the great trees. Shafts 
of light filter through the trees, making patterns on the 
forest floor. The light is dim, deceptive. Lednov, rifle 
ready, searches for some sign of Clay. Then from another 
direction comes the SOUND of movement. Lednov swings his 
rifle in that direction, waits. The SOUND has stopped.

CLAY'S VOICE
I'm here Lednov.

His voice echoes across the hills. Lednov sights along his 
rifle at the direction from which the SOUND of Clay's voice 
came. Momentarily Clay is seen as he runs from one tree to 
another. Lednov fires.

has been putting the bandage on, stands and takes a sack of 
tobacco from his pocket.

CLAY
(rolling cigarette)
How's that?

STEVE
Kind of sore.

CLAY
You'll live.

STEVE
(shyly)
Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold 
my own in a fight, huh?

CLAY
Yeah -- but don't make a habit of 
it.

STEVE
So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell 
you how to run your life?

CLAY
(stares down at him, 
then)
I guess so -- but don't make a habit 
of it.

STEVE
Well, then, I know it takes three -- 
four weeks for you to come round to 
admit when you're wrong... But by 
that time she's liable to be in 
China...

Clay looks at him for a moment, not angry, but not admitting 
he's wrong yet.

DISSOLVE OUT

EXT. SONORA - NIGHT (STOCK)

EXT. SONORA STREET - NIGHT

MED. SHOT. Shelves filled with bottles line the room, for 
the doctor is also the druggist. There is a glass cabinet in

on Steve. The doctor is working on Steve's shoulder and arm.

MED. CLOSE - UP ANGLE

as the doctor probes the wound in Steve's arm. Steve groans. 
The lamp wavers.

DOCTOR
(sharply)
Hold her steady. I'm not hurting 
him.

STEVE
Maybe you're not, but I'll sure be 
glad when you stop pokin' me.

Footsteps are HEARD approaching. Clay tries to steady his 
shaking hand. He is focusing his attention on a far wall. A 
woman's hand comes in the scene and takes the lamp from him. 
He reacts. CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Mary, who has moved 
in beside him.

Steve. He smiles up at Mary.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

ANGLES PAST doctor.

What are you doin' here?

MARY
Holding the lamp.

DOCTOR
Then hold it a little lower.

Mary lowers the lamp.

CLOSE SHOT

Clay and Mary. UP ANGLE PAST lamp.

CLAY
Thanks for taking over.

MARY
(softly)
Thanks for loading me on the stage. 
I know now why you did it.

CLAY
Like I said, women get in the way 
sometimes.

STEVE'S VOICE
He tried to get rid of me, too, Miss 
Wells.

DOCTOR
Keep still, will you.

He straightens into the shot. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO MED. SHOT. 
Steve is now bandaged.

DOCTOR
Put him over there on the cot. 
Goodnight... He'll be all right.

As Clay lifts Steve to the cot the doctor exits. Mary watches 
Clay cover Steve. Then she goes to the door leading to the 
street, stops with her hand on the knob.

MARY
Goodnight.

STEVE
Goodnight, Miss Wells.

MARY
(looking back)
If you need me, I'll be --

Clay straightens and turns.

Where you going?

MARY
To the other side of the street.

She opens the door and starts out.

Mary waits, looking up at him.

CLAY
That job you were talkin' about, did 
you get it yet?

MARY
Why?

CLAY
(haltingly)
Because... well, you said you wanted 
a man to think enough of you to walk 
in the place you were working and 
take you out of there... tonight I 
was sort of tied up with Steve... 
but tomorrow I figured on doing just 
that.

MARY
(softly)
I haven't got the job yet.

They look at each other.

MARY
But if you want to wait until tomorrow --

For answer, Clay takes her in his arms.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE

ANGLED PAST Steve on cot. In the b.g. through the open 
doorway, Clay and Mary kiss. Steve watches a moment, then 
turns his head toward camera. He smiles and closes his eyes.

EXT. PORCH

TWO SHOT - Mary and Clay. They break from the kiss. Clay 
looks down at Mary.

CLAY
(softly)
Is there any place in town a man 
could buy some gingham?

THE MAIN AND CREDIT TITLES ARE IMPOSED ON a mezzotint of
Edinburgh castle viewed from the Causeway.  When the last
credit title dissolves

DISSOLVE TO

STOP FRAME of STOCK SHOT showing Edinburgh castle.  Over this
is a title: 

*EDINBURG -- 1831*

With the DISSOLVE of the words the stock shot comes to life
with a carriage coming toward the CAMERA.

_*EXT. EDINBURGH STREET -- LATE AFTERNOON*_

FULL SPOT -- Down the lonely, almost deserted street comes a
cab drawn by a bony white horse.  This black and sepulchral
vehicle passes through the long shadows and sharp gleams of
the late afternoon sun.  On the box, bunched over, almost
lost in the folds of his triple-caped overcoat and with a
battered beaver on his hand, is the cabman.  The horse plods
along, his hoof beats echoing with a hollow sound in the
narrow street.  At the corner the vehicle turns left.

_*EXT. GREYFRIAR'S CHURCHYARD -- LATE AFTERNOON*_

The black cab drawn by the white horse goes slowly past a
little cemetery.  The driver turns his head and looks down as
he goes past.

From his ANGLE, but not a MOVING SHOT, a pleasant little
graveyard with mossy gravestones; old turf making a spot of
green between the gray walls of the kirk and the blank stone
wall of a large building.

Seated on a table stone is young Donald Fettes, a poor
medical student, dressed in worn neat clothing with only a
woolen scarf about his neck for warmth.  He sits in such
scanty sunlight as he can find, munching on a cold bannock
and washing it down with thin ale from a round stone bottle.

MED. CLOSE SHOT -- Fettes.  In the closer view it can be seen
that he is looking at a small Cairn terrier who lies morosely
guarding a newly-made grave.  The dog, with his head down
between his forepaws, occasionally glances over
apprehensively at the young student.  Fettes takes a bit of
his bannock between his thumb and forefinger and leans
forward toward the dog.

FETTES
Here, -- here's a bit of something
for you.

The dog does not stir.  Fettes leans further forward almost
putting the morsel of food to the dog's nose.  The dog growls
savagely.  Fettes draws back.

FETTES (cont'd)
Now, now, laddie -- I only wanted
to be friendly.

It is at this moment that a shadow falls athwart him and
looms up in the afternoon sunlight against the wall behind
him.  He looks up.

ANOTHER ANGLE -- Fettes looking over as Mrs. MacBride, a
plump, motherly woman of middle-age, with a Tartan shawl over
her head and carrying a pannikin of water and a bone with
some meat on it, comes through the gate.  She crosses over to
the little dog, puts the water before him and starts
shredding little pieces of meat from the bone to feed him. 
The dog laps avidly at the water, then gratefully takes the
morsels of meat she gives him.

MED. FULL SHOT -- Fettes and Mrs. MacBride.

MRS. MACBRIDE
He'll not leave the grave -- not
since Wednesday last when we buried
the lad.

FETTES
Your son, ma'am?  He must have been
a fine boy for the wee dog to love
him so.

Mrs. MacBride nods.

MRS. MACBRIDE
A great, kind lad, he was -- gentle
with all things like Robbie.

She pauses, sighs and then goes on.

MRS. MACBRIDE (cont'd)
Now I can't get the dog to leave,
here.  Perhaps it is for the best. 
I've not money enough to afford a
grave watcher.

FETTES
(looking about)
Not much danger here, ma'am, I
wouldn't think -- right here in the
heart of Edinburgh.

MRS. MACBRIDE
They're uncommon bold, the grave
robbers -- and the daft doctors who
drive them on.

FETTES
(a little uncomfortable;
feeling he has to make
the admission)
I'm by way of being a medical
myself.

MRS. MACBRIDE
A doctor?

FETTES
A student.  I'm studying under Dr.
MacFarlane -- that is, I've been
studying until today --

He starts to get up.  At this moment in the street can be
heard the clop-clop of a horse's hoofs and the rattle of iron
wheels on the cobblestones.  On the ground and gravestones
appears and passes the monstrous shadow of a horse and cab,
angular and distorted, the driver's shadow hunched and evil,
now going from left to right.

_*EXT. EDINBURGH STREET -- LATE AFTERNOON*_

LONG SHOT -- a typical street scene of the time.  A dog cart
drawn by a smart tandem passes.  It is driven by a young buck
of the period; top-hatted, dandified, his whip held at a just
so angle.  On the sidewalk, a group of small boys follow a
recruiting sergeant of the Seaforth Highlanders.  A drummer
walks at his heels.  He stops at a wooden "Charlie", the
rough police booth of that day, and begins to tack up his
posters.  The boys crowd around to watch.  One of them backs
up to a little trundle cart and surreptitiously filches a
piece of the shortbread being sold from this portable store. 
At the other side of the "Charlie" stands a street singer, a
beautiful girl of about nineteen, dressed in ragged Highland
plaid.  She is singing an old border ballad about two crows
who sit waiting to pick the dead eyes out of a fallen knight. 
A shepherd, crook in hand, and faithfully attended by two
handsome collies, stops a moment to hear her song, drops some
coppers into the begging bowl she holds in her hands, then
passes on.

Through the consonance of the street singer's song comes the
dissonant beat of a horse's hoofs, the racking clatter of
iron-shod wheels and then between the singer and the CAMERA
there passes, very close, the white horse and the black cab. 
As it blocks her out of the scene

WIPE DISSOLVE

_*EXT. MACFARLANE'S HOUSE -- LATE AFTERNOON*_

FULL SHOT -- Before the imposing edifice which houses Dr.
MacFarlane's living quarters as well as his school of
anatomy, the cab, drawn by the white horse, pulls up.  The
driver begins to alight from the box.  He climbs down, and
starts for the cab door.

CLOSE SHOT -- Gray as he opens the door.  Gray is a man of
middle years with keen, darting eyes set in a face lined and
furrowed by an evil life.  The quick play of his features as
he talks or smiles can form a moving and deceptive mask.  So
that now as he opens the door, smiling, to help his
passengers alight, his face is cringing with good humor and
servility.

From the cab steps a young and lovely woman dressed in
becoming widow's weeds.  This is Mrs. Marsh.  She reaches the
sidewalk, turns back for the other occupant of the cab.  This
is a little girl of about eight, dressed in a flower-sprigged
Kate Greenway gown and a poke bonnet to match.  Gray
forestalls her.

GRAY
I'll get it, ma'am.

He touches his hat respectfully, reaches in and brings out a
tiny wheel-chair, which he sets down.  He reaches in again
and takes the child up in his arms.

GRAY (cont'd)
(as he picks her up)
Come, little miss.  Cabman Gray'll
carry you safe enough.

With the child in his arms he starts toward his horse's head,
talking as he goes.

GRAY (cont'd)
Give my horse a pat.  He knows
every little girl in Edinburgh. 
Some day when you're runnin' and
playin' in the street he'll nicker
at ye as we go by.

CLOSE SHOT -- The horse, Gray, and the little girl.

GEORGINA
I can't run and play.

GRAY
I'd forgotten that, lassie.  All
the more reason for Friend here
bidding you a good-day.

Georgina smiles and pats the horse's nose.

ANOTHER ANGLE -- Featuring Mrs. Marsh as she smiles watching
Gray and the child.  He turns back toward her.

MRS. MARSH
Would you mind carrying her up the
steps?

Mrs. Marsh reaches for the wheel-chair.

FULL SHOT -- Mrs. Marsh takes the wheel-chair up the two
steps.  Gray follows carrying the child.  He sets the child
tenderly in the wheel-chair, smiling as he does so.

GRAY
Back in your own wee cab.

GEORGINA
Thank you.

In the meantime, Mrs. Marsh has fumbled through her purse for
change.  She hands this to Gray.  He takes the money from his
right hand, then removes his hat with his left hand, bobs his
forelock with the right in a series of obsequious gestures.

GRAY
Thank ye, ma'am.  Thank ye.
(to Georgina)
You watch sharp, little miss for my
horse to give you a "hello".

CLOSE SHOT -- Georgina looking at Gray with great pleased
eyes.  This has made a definite impression on her.

_*EXT. MACFARLANE'S HOUSE -- DAY*_

Mrs. Marsh has used the door knocker.  Now in response the
door is opened by a handsome woman of thirty-five, Meg
Cameron.

MRS. MARSH
I would like to see Dr. MacFarlane.

Meg gives Mrs. Marsh a quick look and then turns to look at
Gray.  A glance passes between them; a glance which tells of
previous acquaintance, yet neither speaks.  He turns and goes
down the steps.  Silently, Meg opens the door and allows Mrs.
Marsh to push Georgina's wheel chair through into the hall.

_*INT. MACFARLANE'S HALLWAY  -- AFTERNOON*_

Georgina's wheel chair is pushed into this gloomy and
forbidding entry.  Meg closes the door behind them, then
without further word, strides down the hall.  Mrs. Marsh and
the little girl wait and look around.

CLOSE SHOT -- Georgina.  With great wide eyes the child looks
around at the antlered stag head, the cruel-looking walking
sticks in the umbrella stand and the light-footed Mercury
with caduceus upraised.  The caduceus throws its patterned
shadow across the child's face.

CLOSE TWO SHOT -- Georgina and Mrs. Marsh.  Mrs. Marsh sees
the fright in the child's face and reassuringly pats her
shoulder.  There is the sound of a door opening and they both
look off in that direction.

MED. FULL SHOT -- The doorway to the sitting room, SHOOTING
PAST Georgina and her mother.  Framed in this doorway is the
tall, robust figure of Dr. Douglas MacFarlane, a man in the
prime of life, dressed with almost flamboyant foppishness and
carrying himself with the assurance that the world is not
only his oyster, but that he has it pinned on a fork and can
swallow it and digest it with pleasure.

THREE SHOT -- Georgina, Mrs. Marsh and Dr. MacFarlane.

MRS. MARSH
(rising)
Dr. MacFarlane?

He half-bows in acknowledgment.

MRS. MARSH (cont'd)
I'm Mrs. Marsh -- this is my
daughter -- Georgina.

She fumbles in her reticule and pulls forth an unsealed
letter which she passes to the doctor.

MRS. MARSH (cont'd)
Dr. Maximillian of Leyden asked me
to present this to you.  He thought
you might examine my little girl.

While she is speaking, Dr. MacFarlane has opened the missive.

MACFARLANE
(as he reads)
Maximillian -- a very famous
colleague of mine.  I'm delighted
to honor his request.

With an expansive gesture he points to a door.  Mrs. Marsh
pushes the wheel chair toward the living room door.

DOLLY SHOT -- the entrance to the sitting room.

MACFARLANE (cont'd)
(over the child's head to
Mrs. Marsh)
Born paralyzed?

The little girl shrinks from him at the bluntness of this
question.

MRS. MARSH
No.  It was an accident.

_*INT. SITTING ROOM -- AFTERNOON*_

Although it is late afternoon the lamps have been lit in this
part of the house.  Mrs. Marsh wheels the chair into the
middle of the room and then stands to one side so that Dr.
MacFarlane can examine the child.  Meg Cameron stands by the
window.

MACFARLANE
Was the paralysis immediate?

MRS. MARSH
No, Doctor.  She seemed to get
better, then about six months later
she began to complain of pain in
her back --

MACFARLANE
How long after that was the
paralysis complete?

MRS. MARSH
Nearly a year.

MACFARLANE
Any attacks of pain since?

MRS. MARSH
Yes, Doctor.

MACFARLANE
Is her pain sporadic or constant?

MRS. MARSH
It comes at intervals.  They used
to be months apart -- but they've
been growing more frequent --
(catch in her voice)
much more frequent.

MACFARLANE
(directly to Georgina)
See here, child, when you have this
pain in your back, where is it?

GEORGINA
(setting her jaw)
I don't know.

MACFARLANE
Point to where it hurts.  You can
at least do that, can't you?

GEORGINA
I don't know.

MACFARLANE
(angrily to Mrs. Marsh)
This is useless, ma'am.

He leaves the sentence unfinished and goes toward the center
of the room.  Mrs. Marsh leans down beside the chair.

TWO SHOT -- Mrs. Marsh and Georgina.

MRS. MARSH
Please, darling, don't be so
stubborn.

Georgina darts a glance in MacFarlane's direction.

GEORGINA
(whispering)
Mother -- he frightens me.

MED. FULL SHOT -- the door in the background.  There is a
soft rap at the door and then almost immediately it opens and
Fettes comes in.  He looks about, sees the doctor busily
engaged with a beautiful young woman and a sick child.  He is
embarrassed and tries to withdraw.

FETTES
Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --

MACFARLANE
Come in, boy -- come in.

Fettes closes the door behind him and stands rather shyly,
not knowing what to do or say.

MACFARLANE (cont'd)
Perhaps you can do something with
this young lady.  I can't get an
aye, yes, or no out of her.

FETTES
(protesting)
But, Doctor, I only wanted to speak
to you --

MACFARLANE
(interrupting)
Come -- it's a chance to try out
your bedside manner, Fettes.  Take
a look at the child.

Fettes walks up shyly to the child.

TWO SHOT -- Fettes and Georgina.  Fettes stands abashed and
awkward before the clear-eyed glance of the little invalid. 
He smiles at her.  The child smiles back.

GEORGINA
Are you a doctor, too?

FETTES
Not yet.

GEORGINA
You'll be a good doctor.  I know
all about doctors.

Fettes smiles.

FETTES
That's a nice chair you have.

He pushes it.  It rolls a little.

FETTES (cont'd)
Useful, too.  Where did you get it? 
It isn't English, is it?

GEORGINA
(studying him)
What you really want to ask me is
about my back, isn't it -- about
where it hurts?

FETTES
Why, yes.

GEORGINA
Well --

She leans forward and reaches around with one hand.

GEORGINA (cont'd)
It's sort of all around here --
then down my legs -- it aches as if
I had been walking an awfully long
way --
(looking up at Fettes)
That's funny, isn't it -- because I
can't walk at all.

FETTES
Would you mind very much if I
lifted you --
(pointing to a table in
the other room)
-- onto that table in there?

She holds out her arms to him.  Fettes lifts her up and
carries her into the other room.

The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Mrs. Marsh and MacFarlane
watching Fettes and the child.  They stand in the f.g.
talking together while in the other room Fettes puts the
child down on her stomach, opens her dress and examines her.

MACFARLANE
Child seems to take to the lad. 
What sort of an accident was it,
Ma'am?

MRS. MARSH
A carriage overturned.  My husband
was killed and Georgina was hurt.

MACFARLANE
How long ago?

MRS. MARSH
Three years.

FETTES
(calling from the other
room)
Dr. MacFarlane --

MACFARLANE
(to Mrs. Marsh)
Excuse me.

He strides forward.  Mrs. Marsh remains where she is.

_*INT. EXAMINATION ROOM -- DAY*_

MacFarlane comes into the scene, bends over and examines the
little girl's back.  He feels the spine with first one hand,
then the other.  He nods to Fettes and turns away.  Fettes
begins to button up the little girl's dress.

_*INT. SITTING ROOM -- DAY*_

MacFarlane is walking back to where Mrs. Marsh stands.  In
the b.g. Fettes can be seen as he buttons up the little
girl's dress, picks her up in his arms and brings her back to
the wheel chair.  MacFarlane comes over to Mrs. Marsh.

TRUCKING SHOT of MacFarlane.

MACFARLANE
Meg, give Fettes a hand there --
help him wheel the little girl into
the hall.

He turns back to Mrs. Marsh.

TWO SHOT -- Mrs. Marsh and MacFarlane.  She is looking at him
anxiously; waiting to hear his verdict.  He glances at Dr.
Maximillian's letter before speaking.

MACFARLANE (cont'd)
(tapping the letter in his
hand)
It seems that Dr. Maximillian is
right.  The violence of the
accident must have disturbed the
tissues and caused a traumatic
tumor -- a sort of growth that
presses against the nerve centers.

MRS. MARSH
But can anything be done for her?

MACFARLANE
Perhaps -- a delicate operation --
an operation which has never been
performed -- but it could be
performed.  I'm sure it could be --
I could incise the columna dorsi --

He is quite excited as he speaks, almost as if challenging
himself.  Mrs.  Marsh's interruption is ill-timed.  It stops
him in full tide of self-persuasion.

MRS. MARSH
(eagerly)
And you will try -- you will
operate?

CLOSE SHOT -- MacFarlane.  He is silent; thinking.

MED. FULL SHOT.  MacFarlane silently turns away from Mrs.
Marsh and goes to his desk.  Having reached it, he turns and
faces her again.

MACFARLANE
Not I, Madame.

She starts toward him impulsively as if to plead with him.

MRS. MARSH
But, Doctor, in Leyden -- in Paris 
- wherever I've taken Georgina --
they've mentioned your name.  I've
come to think of you as our only
hope.

MacFarlane looks at her, takes a step closer to her and
speaks very sincerely.

MACFARLANE
Believe me, Madame, if I were only
a doctor, I would undertake this
operation at once.  But I'm more
dominie than doctor -- I've a
school to run.

MRS. MARSH
But, Doctor, surely in a case like
this -- a child -- a little child
who can never walk or run --

MACFARLANE
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the
responsibility of training thirty
other doctors to attend a thousand
children like your own.

MRS. MARSH
There's nothing I can say for one
small child?

MACFARLANE
I'm not heartless, Ma'am.  I have
every sympathy for you and for the
little girl, but if I were to
consent to every operation brought
to me, I'd have no time for
teaching -- and that's a great
responsibility upon me, Ma'am -- a
great responsibility.

They have reached the door.  He bows in dismissal, and Mrs.
Marsh exits.  As she leaves, Fettes passes her coming from
the hallway.

MED. CLOSE SHOT -- MacFarlane as he turns back into the room.

MACFARLANE (cont'd)
(to Fettes)
Well, Fettes -- what was it you
wanted to see me about?

MED. TWO SHOT -- Fettes and MacFarlane.

FETTES
(shyly)
I'm afraid I'll have to give up
medicine, Dr. MacFarlane.

MACFARLANE
(booming)
You're made for a doctor, young
man!

FETTES
I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You
see, my father is vicar at Thrums --
it's a small parish -- not much of
a living --

MACFARLANE
(after thinking this over
a moment; very sincerely)
You're too good a man, Fettes --
I'll not let you quit.
(with a sudden thought)
I'll make an assistant of you --
that'll pay your keep and your
tuition, too --

FETTES
I thought only the best students
were made assistants.

MACFARLANE
Well? And are you not a good
student?

FETTES
(getting the idea)
But Richardson?

MACFARLANE
Richardson is a fine student.  He's
got a glib tongue, but you'll be a
better doctor, Fettes.  Come along
now --

He links his arm through Fettes' and starts toward the door
leading to the stairs.

MACFARLANE (cont'd)
-- let's get to the anatomy room --
I'll explain your new duties.

They have reached the door.  Meg is standing there.  As
MacFarlane and Fettes start to pass her, Meg puts her hand on
the doctor's arm.  He pauses.

MEG
A word with you, Dr. MacFarlane.

MacFarlane motions Fettes to proceed into the other room.  He
closes the door behind him.

MEG (cont'd)
You're not having Fettes for your
assistant?

MACFARLANE
And why not?  He's a good lad --
bright and able.

MEG
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why
I ask you, MacFarlane.

MACFARLANE
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? 
Was I not assistant to Knox?

MEG
(thoughtfully)
Aye -- 

MACFARLANE
Did it spoil me, Meg, my lass?

She looks directly at him without answering.  MacFarlane
grows uneasy.

MACFARLANE (cont'd)
(walking up to her,
putting an arm around her
shoulders and tilting up
her chin with his other
hand)
It will do the boy no harm.

He kisses her off-handedly.  She wraps her arm around his
neck and kisses him with fierce passion.  He releases
himself, goes on into the next room.

_*INT. ANATOMY ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON*_

The anatomy room is dim.  Long level bars of light come
through the wide windows to illuminate the bare austerity of
this classroom.  The long rows of tables have a sombre and
empty look.  Everything is meticulously clean.

At one of the tables is the hunched, dark and evil figure of
Joseph, the janitor of the school.  He is engaged in rubbing
the surface of a marble-topped table.  The door on the
landing opens.  MacFarlane and Fettes come through. 
MacFarlane still has his arm linked through that of his young
friend and is listening to Fettes' gratitude with evident
pleasure.

FETTES
-- all my gratitude, sir -- I can
never express it...

MED. FULL SHOT -- Fettes and MacFarlane as they descend the
stairs.

MACFARLANE
(lightly)
They'll be satisfaction enough for
me to know I've trained the great
Dr. Fettes.

MED. SHOT to include Joseph in the f.g. and Fettes and
MacFarlane as they reach the floor level of the anatomy room. 
Joseph, continuing his work, casts a sidelong glance at the
doctor and student.  It is evident he is listening to every
word they say.

MACFARLANE (cont'd)
Now -- as to your duties.  It is up
to you to keep the accounts and to
distribute the specimens to the
students.  Also, inasmuch as you'll
be living in the house --

He looks over and glances at Joseph and having noticed that
Joseph is eavesdropping, breaks off short.

MACFARLANE (cont'd)
(to Joseph)
Joseph --

Joseph looks up.

MACFARLANE (cont'd)
What are you doing, sneaking about
here like a Redskin?  Make a little
noise, man.  Let people know you're
about --

JOSEPH
(meekly)
Yes, Doctor -- yes.

MACFARLANE
-- otherwise I might get the idea
you are trying to spy on me.

He takes Fettes' arm again and leads him off toward the other
end of the anatomy room.  The two medicals go out of earshot,
with Joseph in the f.g.

_*INT. THE ALCOVE -- LATE AFTERNOON*_

This is the small out-cropping of the main room set a few
feet lower in level.  At one end is a heavy curtain of green
baize.

MED. FULL SHOT.  MacFarlane and Fettes descend the steps
leading to the alcove.  MacFarlane, with his hand on the
elbow of the younger man, guides him to the curtain.

MACFARLANE
You know how we get the specimens
we use for dissection?

FETTES
From the Municipal Council --
they're the bodies of paupers --

The CAMERA BEGINS TO DOLLY SLOWLY TOWARD them.

MACFARLANE
That's what the law stipulates but
there are not enough of them,
Fettes -- there are not enough of
them --

MacFarlane pulls aside the curtain.  He and Fettes pass
through and the curtain falls into place behind them.  The
CAMERA CONTINUES TO TRUCK SLOWLY TOWARD the curtain.

SLOW DISSOLVE

_*EXT. GREYFRIAR'S KIRKYARD -- NIGHT*_

CLOSE SHOT.  The little dog, Robbie, is lying on his master's
grave.  He lies with his muzzle on his forepaws but his eyes
are open and alert.  Out of the scene comes the plodding beat
of a horse's hoofs and the rumbling of iron-shod wheels.  The
dog lifts his head.

The horse comes to a stop.  There is the creak of springs as
someone alights.  The dog's hackles rise.  He growls.

ANOTHER ANGLE.  The great black shadow of a man in a caped
overcoat and top hat with a spade over his shoulder is thrown
onto the wall of Greyfriar's Kirk by the street lamp.  The
huge shadow looms high over the tiny dog.  Robbie rises
valiantly to his feet, snarling.  As he does so, the actual
figure of the man, as black and indistinct as his own shadow,
comes past the camera, blacking out the little dog.  There is
a deeper growl from Robbie.  The man swings his spade down. 
As the spade drives home there is a little weak sound from
the dog.

ANOTHER ANGLE.  With his foot, Gray pushes the dead body of
the little dog to one side, strikes the spade into the ground
and starts to dig.

*_INT. FETTES' ROOM -- NIGHT_*

In a little attic room, Fettes is sleeping fitfully.  The
room is flooded with moonlight which comes in through a
skylight window.

MED. CLOSE SHOT -- Fettes sleeping.  Far away can be heard
the plodding hoofbeats and creaking wheels of Gray's cab. 
There is a loud squeak as the cab takes the turn into the
alleyway.  Fettes wakens.  He listens.  There is a sound of
the hoofbeats, the wheels and then silence when the horse
comes to a stop.  He sits up.  From downstairs comes a
stealthy knocking at the door.  He gets up sleepily and
starts to put on his worn bathrobe, crosses to the window and
looks out.

_*EXT. ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT*_

HIGH ANGLE SHOT from Fettes' window.  Gray, his cab and the
white horse present a weird and funereal spectacle.  Gray is
fumbling with something inside the cab.

_*INT. FETTES' ROOM -- NIGHT*_

Fettes has turned from the window and starts toward the door. 
He opens it and goes out.

_*EXT. ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT*_

Gray is pulling a long, canvas-colored object of considerable
weight from the cab.  With a grunt he gets it up into his
arms and starts across the sidewalk toward the postern door.

_*INT. ANATOMY ROOM -- NIGHT*_

It is dark except for a small oil lamp left burning as a
nightlight.  This casts its dim rays over a small portion of
the room near the entrance door.  Fettes comes through the
door on the landing.  He peers over the bannisters and then
somewhat slowly, as if not too easy at the prospect before
him, he begins to descend the stairs.

ANOTHER ANGLE.  Fettes crosses the anatomy room looking
apprehensively into the darkness at either end.  At the door
he pauses a moment, then passes through into the darkness of
the entry and is lost to view.

_*INT. ENTRYWAY -- NIGHT*_

It is so dark that Fettes can barely be seen.  The clank of
the chain as he throws it off and the snap of the bolt are
loud and frightening in this small enclosed space.  He pulls
the door open.  Before him silhouetted against the dim
radiance of the cab lamps is Gray.  In his arms is a long,
cloth-covered object.

CLOSE SHOT -- Fettes as he opens the door wider to give Gray
entrance.  Without a word, Gray carries the body past him
into the anatomy room.  Fettes closes the door and follows
him.

_*INT. ANATOMY ROOM -- NIGHT*_

Gray comes in and stands waiting for Fettes to come up to
him.  Fettes comes out of the entry and takes a few steps
toward Gray.

GRAY
Here -- give me a hand -- this is
heavy.

Fettes helps him.  Gingerly he takes hold of the corpse and
together they lay it down on a long marble-topped table in
the center of the room, almost directly under the nightlight. 
Gray heaves a sigh of relief to be relieved of the weight.

GRAY (cont'd)
You'll find the specimen in good
condition.  He was bright and
cheerful as a thrush not a week
long gone.  A likely lad, I'm told.
(glances at Fettes)
You're the new assistant?

Fettes nods.

FETTES
(trying to remember his
manners)
I'm Donald Fettes.

GRAY
I'm very pleased to know you,
Master Fettes.

FETTES
Mr. Gray?

GRAY
That's right.  Gray, the cabman. 
I've had a bit of dealing with
MacFarlane in the past, you know.

Fettes nods.

GRAY (cont'd)
And I've always gotten along with
his assistants -- providing they
understood my humble position.

He puts one hand on Fettes' arm.  Fettes moves away from him.

FETTES
Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay
you --

GRAY
(interrupting)
Of course -- it's the soul of the
business -- the pay --

Fettes shifts uneasily, confused and seemingly uncertain of
his next step.

GRAY (cont'd)
(prompting him)
I have no doubt you have the key in
your pocket --

Fettes reaches into his pocket and brings out a big iron key.

GRAY (cont'd)
(pointing)
And there is the box.

They start over toward it.  Fettes opens the box.

GRAY (cont'd)
My fee is as usual -- ten pounds.

Fettes counts out the money to him.  Gray flips the last coin
into the air and catches it with a gamin gesture which is
surprising in a man of such sinister appearance.  As Fettes
still stands rather stupidly, Gray prompts him again.

GRAY (cont'd)
And now, although it's none of my
business, I would make the proper
entry if I were you.  "One specimen
-- ten pounds -- received from --
let us say -- "MacDuff" -- a royal
name.

Fettes looks toward the desk.

GRAY (cont'd)
(still prompting him)
It's the little cloth-covered book
in the drawer.

Fettes brings it out.  Gray watches him while he writes.  The
pen scratches and squeaks over the paper.  Then both turn and
start toward the entry.

FETTES
Good night, Mr. Gray.

As the door Gray tips his hat elegantly to Fettes.

GRAY
My respects, Master Fettes, and may
this be the first of many
profitable meetings.

He leaves, disappearing in the darkness of the entryway.  A
second later the door can be heard closing behind him. 
Fettes stands for a long moment looking at the dark entry,
then from behind him comes a chuckle of laughter.  He whirls
abruptly.

ANOTHER ANGLE -- Fettes in the b.g. and above him on the
landing, holding a candle, is Dr. MacFarlane in an elegant
dressing gown.

MACFARLANE
Well, well, my boy.  Your first
meeting with the redoubtable Gray. 
You may count it as a milestone in
your medical career.

MED. CLOSE SHOT -- Fettes as he looks from MacFarlane to the
door.

FETTES
My medical career -- 

FADE OUT

FADE IN

_*INT. ANATOMY SCHOOL -- DAY*_

CLOSE SHOT -- skeleton.  It is facing the camera, its stance
a parody of that prize fighter of the period; left well
extended, right held high, both knees bent.  Over the shot
comes a clamor of men's voices, cutting across which,
suddenly, comes Fettes' voice.

FETTES
All right, gentleman -- that will
do!  Settle down!

The CAMERA PULLS BACK to show the interior of the school.  In
the f.g. is the dais, at one side of which is the skeleton. 
Fettes steps up onto the dais at the other side of the
passing some dozen students, all young men in their early
twenties.  Two students, Gilchrist and Richardson, are
prominent.  Richardson is lean and sardonic.

FETTES (cont'd)
Dr. MacFarlane has asked me to
review the points he has just
discussed with you.

MED. CLOSE SHOT -- dais.  The skeleton is to one side in the
f.g. facing the students, o.s.  Fettes has his back to it.

FETTES (cont'd)
He started with the construction of
the ribs and the haemapophyses --

He turns toward the skeleton, then reacts sharply as he
notices its ludicrous stance.

FETTES (cont'd)
(angrily)
I suppose this was your doing,
Richardson.

He starts rearranging the skeleton's limbs.  Richardson
grins.  It is at this moment that Joseph comes sidling up to
the group.

JOSEPH
Mr. Fettes --

Fettes looks over at him.

JOSEPH (cont'd)
A lady is asking for you.

FETTES
What lady, Joseph?

Joseph shrugs.  Fettes, seeing that he'll get no
enlightenment from him, turns to the students.

FETTES (cont'd)
If you gentleman will excuse me --

He starts for the stairs.  There is a snicker of laughter. 
Richardson leans over and with two deft movements brings the
arms of the skeleton back into fighting position.

_*INT. MACFARLANE HALLWAY -- DAY*_

Mrs. Marsh sits there.  Broad beams of sunlight flood in from
the front windows.  She is speaking with Meg Cameron.  Meg is
standing looking down at her.

MEG
Why do you come here?  The Doctor
said he wouldn't operate.

MRS. MARSH
I've already told you I didn't come
to see Dr. MacFarlane.

MEG
Then whom do you wish to see in
MacFarlane's own house?

It is at this moment that the door opens and Fettes comes in. 
Meg takes one glance at him.

MEG (cont'd)
(almost under her breath)
So it is in that direction that the
wind blows, eh?  It will get you
nothing.

With that she turns on her heel and goes off to a little door
on the left.

MRS. MARSH
(rising)
Good morning, Mr. Fettes.

Fettes bows formally.  It is obvious he is pleased, yet very
puzzled to see her.  He comes down and takes her hand.

FETTES
You asked to see me, ma'am?

MRS. MARSH
(impulsively)
I want you to help my little girl.

FETTES
I'm only a student.

MRS. MARSH
Georgina told me how kind you were
to her.  It gave me hope you might
intercede for us with Dr.
MacFarlane.

FETTES
I don't know that I can do that,
Mrs. Marsh.

MRS. MARSH
Did he tell you about Georgina?

Fettes nods.

MRS. MARSH (cont'd)
Then he must have told you that
this disease is progressive -- that
it will grow worse -- that soon she
will not be able to move at all.

Fettes nods again.  Mrs. Marsh lays her hand on his arm and
looks directly into his eyes.

MRS. MARSH (cont'd)
And you won't ask him to help?

FETTES
I didn't mean it that way.  I meant
only that I am not in a position to
ask favors.

MRS. MARSH
Ask this one favor --

FETTES
(very much moved)
Of course I will.

Mrs. Marsh smiles at him.

MRS. MARSH
Georgina was right.  You are a kind
man.

She extends her hand and Fettes takes it.

FETTES
I'll do what I can.

He walks with her to the door, lets her out, closes it behind
her and then turns and starts back the way he came.

_*INT. THE ANATOMY ROOM -- DAY*_

MacFarlane is present and now in contrast to the disorder
under Fettes the students are busy and absorbed.  They are
working at their tasks.  MacFarlane, with two or three around
him, is helping one of the students, Gilchrist.

MACFARLANE
(enthusiastically)
In an adult this muscle can apply
more than one hundred seventy-five
pounds of pressure?  Double that
and you get the full strength of
the human jaw.
(jocularly)
That, gentlemen, is to chew our
food and bite our enemies.

The students laugh; that peculiar laugh common to students
and soldiers when a superior makes a joke.  It is at this
moment that Fettes starts down the stairs.  MacFarlane looks
up.

MACFARLANE (cont'd)
Here, Fettes, life can't be all
skittles and ladies --

This sally provokes a low murmur of appreciative laughter
from the students.  Fettes, discomfited, joins the group.

MACFARLANE (cont'd)
(pulling a watch from his
pocket)
It's time for our luncheon.  I've a
bit of beef to discuss and --
(bowing slightly)
I leave you all to whatever
arrangements you have made to serve
the inner man.

FULL SHOT -- Fettes as he takes up a small bundle wrapped in
a handkerchief and starts for the door.

MED. SHOT -- MacFarlane as he starts for the stairs.  He
passes a table where Richardson is bent over his work, which
is out of scene.

MACFARLANE (cont'd)
Well, I see you have that arm
you've been yearning for,
Richardson.

RICHARDSON
Yes, sir.  This fellow must have
been a great one at hurling the bar
-- beautiful biceps.  Burke and
Hare would never have got the best
of this fellow.

MacFarlane's head jerks up and he looks directly at
Richardson.

MACFARLANE
What did you say?

RICHARDSON
I was making a joke, sir.

MACFARLANE
(passing on)
It's a poor subject for jest,
Richardson -- particularly for a
medical student.

He turns abruptly away and starts toward the stairs.

GILCHRIST
(to Richardson)
What did you say to His Imperial
Highness?

RICHARDSON
Nothing but a merry word about
Burke and Hare --

GILCHRIST
That's nothing for him to get upset
about.  They're dead and buried --

Richardson shrugs.

DISSOLVE

_*EXT. GREYFRIAR'S CHURCHYARD -- DAY*_

Fettes comes along the street toward the gateway.  Suddenly
he stops and looks at a small crowd which has gathered around
the gate, all talking very excitedly and peering in over each
other's shoulders.  He stands and looks.

MED. FULL SHOT -- the crowd at the gate.  The people draw
back making way for Mrs. MacBride who comes out.

MED. CLOSE SHOT -- Mrs. MacBride as she makes her way through
the crowd.  She is crying and in her arms she carries the
dead body of the little dog.

ANOTHER ANGLE -- SHOOTING FROM behind Fettes.  Mrs. MacBride
comes through the crowd and starts across the street toward
him.

CLOSE SHOT -- Mrs. MacBride and Fettes.  Fettes looks at her.

MRS. MACBRIDE
(as she passes him)
They killed his wee doggie too --
little Robbie.
(passes on)

CLOSE SHOT -- Fettes as he watches Mrs. MacBride.  From
behind him comes the sound of the street singer's song.

DISSOLVE

_*INT. MACFARLANE'S STUDY -- LATE AFTERNOON*_

MacFarlane is seated on a high stool at a work table.  He has
before him two large bones and is measuring these with a pair
of dividers and marking down notations in a notebook.  While
he works he whistles "The Blue Bells of Scotland."  There is
a knock at the door.

MACFARLANE
Come in!

He looks over his shoulder to see Fettes as he enters then
turns back to his work.  Fettes comes up and stands beside
him.  MacFarlane makes a notation in the notebook and then
looks up.

MACFARLANE (cont'd)
Well, Fettes -- where have you
been?  I didn't see you at the
afternoon session.

FETTES
I don't think I can go on, sir.

MACFARLANE
(whirling around on the
stool)
What the devil do you mean?  You
have your lodgings, a certain
stipend -- I thought I had arranged
everything for you --

FETTES
I saw the woman whose son's body
was delivered last night.

MacFarlane nods.

FETTES (cont'd)
That man took the body from
Greyfriar's.  I knew the woman. 
I knew the little dog on the grave. 
He killed the dog.

MACFARLANE
And that's why you don't want to be
a doctor, Fettes?

FETTES
Not if I have to be party to things
like that, Dr. MacFarlane.

MacFarlane studies him for a moment.  He then gets up from
the stool and puts his hand on the boy's shoulder.

MACFARLANE
Fettes, I was an assistant once.  I
had to deal with men like Gray.  Do
you think I did it because I wanted
to?  Do you think I want to do it
now?  But I must and you must.

Fettes shakes his head.  MacFarlane puts his other hand on
Fettes' other shoulder.

MACFARLANE (cont'd)
Ignorant men have dammed up the
stream of medical progress with
stupid and unjust laws.  If that
dam will not break, the other men
of medicine have to find other
courses.  You understand me,
Fettes?

Fettes nods.

FETTES
But this woman -- and her son --

MACFARLANE
I'm sorry for the woman, Fettes. 
But her son might be alive today
had more doctors been given the
opportunity to work on more human
specimens.  As for me, Fettes, I
let no man stop me when I know I'm
right -- when I know that I need
those lifeless subjects for my
student's enlightenment and for my
own knowledge.  And if you're a
real man and want to be a good
doctor, you'll see it as I see it.

There is a long pause.  MacFarlane lets his hands drop to his
sides.

MACFARLANE (cont'd)
Well, boy?

Fettes nods.  MacFarlane claps him jovially on the back.

MACFARLANE (cont'd)
You're a good lad, Fettes.
(looking at Fettes more
closely)
But you look a bit pale to me.  I'm
dining at Hobbs.  Come along with
me and have a bit of the joint and
a glass of ale.  It will put new
life in you.

He takes the boy's arm and they start from the room.

_*EXT. EDINBURGH STREET -- NIGHT*_

The pavement is glistening from a recent rain and there is a
hint of fog in the air.  It is the dinner hour and the street
is fairly well peopled.  On one corner by the light of a
flaring torch a pamphleteer is selling his wares.  On the
other corner the street singer stands chanting her ballad;
the dolorous phrases reciting the tale of a dead knight
deserted by his horse, his hound and his leman fair.

MED. FULL SHOT -- the singer.  MacFarlane, with top hat, cape
and carrying a cane swings briskly past her with Fettes, more
soberly dressed, at his side.  They stride out of scene.

_*EXT. HOBBS PUBLIC HOUSE -- NIGHT*_

MacFarlane with Fettes in tow comes breezing up.  With a
lordly gesture he ushers Fettes before him into the public
house.

_*INT. HOBBS PUBLIC HOUSE -- NIGHT*_

It is bright, warm and cheerful.  A huge fire is roaring in
the fireplace and before it is a rack spit turned by a spit
boy who sings as he turns.  (Song to be supplied.)  On the
spit is a young porker with forelegs and hind legs stretched
to elongate him before the fire.  The porker has just
recently been put on the spit so that he gleams pale white in
the warm glow of the fire.

MED. FULL SHOT -- at the door.  Fettes, followed by
MacFarlane comes in.  Fettes looks shyly around him while a
man servant takes his hat.  MacFarlane boldly flings his hat
and cape to the attendant and strides forward toward the
fireplace.  He extends his hands and looks at the slowly
turning porker.

MACFARLANE
(to Fettes)
We'll have a stiffener or two of
hot rum and by then we will be able
to meet this fellow on fairly equal
terms of warmth, eh Fettes?

From behind them comes an insinuating voice.

GRAY'S VOICE
A fine "specimen" isn't he, Toddy
MacFarlane?

They both twist around quickly.

REVERSE SHOT -- on the opposite side of the room where he has
hidden from them by the high walls of the divan, a sort of
inglenook built away from the fireplace, is Gray.  This is
"common" section of the inn.  He sits with a loaf of coarse
bread before him and a glass of stout at his elbow.  He is
grinning.  Without rising, Gray beckons.

GRAY
Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here
with me.

MACFARLANE
Don't call me that confounded name.

GRAY
(still grinning)
Well, then, Doctor MacFarlane --
although I've known a time, Toddy,
when you liked the name.  Aye, and
many are dead now who called you by
it; rough and wild ones they were,
too.  But come Toddy, sit down here
with your young friend.

Fettes looks in surprise from the doctor to the cabman,
utterly confused at the familiarity of this man's address.

MACFARLANE
(coldly)
Mr. Fettes and I have professional
matters to discuss.

GRAY
Medicine?  That'll keep.  Sit down.

As MacFarlane hesitates, angry and most anxious to refuse,
Gray lowers his tone to a sly confidential murmur.

GRAY (cont'd)
You wouldn't want it said of you
that you refused a glass to an old
friend.

MacFarlane shrugs.

MACFARLANE
We'll buy you a glass, Gray.

He motions to Fettes to sit down.  Fettes takes a seat and
MacFarlane sits down beside him.  As Fettes sits down beside
him, Gray turns to him in a confidential manner.

GRAY
I'm a pretty bad fellow myself, but
MacFarlane is the boy -- Toddy
MacFarlane --

He chuckles, shaking his head as if in appreciation of the
most sinister sort of villainy.  MacFarlane is angry.  Fettes
is confused and unable to orient himself in this strange
relationship between the great anatomist and the lowly
cabman.  Gray turns to MacFarlane.

GRAY (cont'd)
Come, Toddy, order for your friend.

MacFarlane lifts his hand to beckon to the waiter.

GRAY (CONT'D)
No, on second thought, let me
order.
(as the waiter comes up)
We'll have a bowl of hot punch and
a cut off the loin from that fine
porker.

The waiter looks at Gray dubiously, unused to such a
sumptuous order from so humble a customer.

GRAY (cont'd)
(catching the look)
You needn't worry, waiter, I'm with
my friend -- the great Dr.
MacFarlane -- he wants to sit here
with the commonality.

The waiter nods, looks from MacFarlane's tense and angry face
to Gray's grinning countenance, turns and makes off to the
kitchen.  For a moment the three men sit silently, MacFarlane
encircled in the iron ring of his anger;
Fettes tongue-tied and abashed and Gray gloating over the
doctor's discomfiture.  Finally Gray breaks the silence.

GRAY (cont'd)
(to MacFarlane)
Well, you were going to talk of
medical matters.  Don't let my
humble presence stop you.  Speak
up, Toddy.

MacFarlane, goaded beyond the point of endurance, pounds his
fist on the table.

MACFARLANE
I will not have you use that name
to me.

GRAY
You will not have it?

The two men glare at each other, then very slowly MacFarlane
averts his gaze.  Fettes looks from one to the other and then
trying to cover the defeat of his teacher, begins to speak.

FETTES
Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the
lady who came to see you yesterday --
the lady with the little girl?

MACFARLANE
I remember her.

FETTES
She came again today.  She wanted
me to ask you if you would not
break your rule and operate.  She
feels you are her only hope.

MACFARLANE
So she told me.  I'm a teacher --
not a practitioner.

MacFarlane shrugs as if this aspect of the conversation were
closed.  Gray looks over at him quizzically.

GRAY
You're a teacher, eh?  Maybe you're
afraid to be a doctor, Toddy.

MACFARLANE
Afraid of what?

GRAY
Afraid you are not as good a doctor
perhaps as you make out to be.

MACFARLANE
I am the best man for the job.

GRAY
Why don't you do it then?

He pauses and looks slyly at MacFarlane.

GRAY (cont'd)
I'd like you to do the operation,
Toddy.

MACFARLANE
You?  Why?  Since when have you
become the protector of little
children?

GRAY
I'm not concerned about the child,
Toddy.  It's you I'm thinking of,
I'd like to see you prove that a
lot of things I know haven't hurt
Toddy MacFarlane any.

MACFARLANE
I'll not do it, Gray.

GRAY
Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to
oblige Fettes and myself.

MACFARLANE
No.

GRAY
Maybe there's some private reason
between you and me which will make
you -- some long lost friend of
ours.
(dropping his voice)
Say that you'll do it for me and my
friend, Mr. Fettes, here.

The two men exchange glances for a moment.

MACFARLANE
(trying to cover up)
It might be an interesting case.

GRAY
That's a good boy, Toddy.

NOTE:  The following line to be shot as protection for the
content of this scene.

MACFARLANE
You only want me to do it because I
don't want to.  That's it, isn't
it, Gray?

MacFarlane glares at him with hatred.  Gray grins and turns
to Fettes.

GRAY
Toddy hates me.

MACFARLANE
(muttering)
Don't call me that confounded name,
I tell you.

GRAY
Hear him?  Did you ever see the
lads play knife?

He picks up the table knife and puts it across his knuckles,
then with a sweep of his fist, tosses it into the loaf of
bread.

GRAY (cont'd)
He would like to do that all over
my body.

FETTES
(trying to make a joke)
We medicals have a better way than
that.  When we dislike a friend we
dissect him.

MacFarlane looks up sharply.  Gray glances at him and smiles.

GRAY
You'll never get rid of me that
way, Toddy.  You and I have two
bodies -- aye, very different sorts
of bodies -- but we're closer than
if we were in the same skin -- for
I saved that skin of yours once and
you'll not forget it.

The waiter comes, bearing a steaming bowl of punch.  He
ladles out a glassful and puts it before MacFarlane. 
MacFarlane drinks thirstily, glad of this excuse to avoid
Gray's penetrating glance.

FADE OUT

FADE IN

_*EXT. THE RAMPARTS -- DAY*_

The ramparts of the castle of Edinburgh are about thirty feet
wide and overgrown with the grass of centuries.  This forms a
narrow lawn between two crenellated stone walls.  From these
battlements only a distant horizon line, a few spires and
fleecy clouds above the town can be seen.

LONG SHOT -- a small group of children.  The CAMERA PANS WITH
these children as they run, laughing and shouting, across the
lawn of the ramparts.  When they run past the little
wheelchair in which Georgina is seated, the CAMERA HOLDS ON
Georgina.  She turns her head to watch the children run off. 
Then she turns and looks the other way to where her mother
and Fettes are standing by the ramparts, deep in
conversation.  The CAMERA PANS WITH her gaze.  They are out
of earshot of the child talking in low, confidential tones.

MRS. MARSH
You have his promise, then?

FETTES
Yes.

Mrs. Marsh looks over at Georgina, then back to Fettes. 
Fettes turns and looks over at Georgina.

FETTES (cont'd)
There will be great pain connected
with it, ma'am.  During the
operation and afterward -- great
pain and shock --

MRS. MARSH
(almost breathing the
words)
-- pain -- and shock.  She's brave
enough, but I don't know about
myself.  Now that it seems so
close, I wonder if I dare trust my
child into any but God's hands. 
Maybe He knows best.

FETTES
Ma'am, is you'll allow me, I'd like
to give you cause for courage --
Dr. MacFarlane is a great man -- I
think he's the greatest man in
medicine.  God would not have given
him such gifts if they were not
meant for Georgina's cure.

Mrs. Marsh looks at him gratefully.

MRS. MARSH
(sincerely)
Thank you, Mr. Fettes.

MED. CLOSE SHOT -- Georgina.  Seated in her little wheel
chair, she is cuddling a porcelain-faced doll of the period. 
Suddenly she hears something in the street far below.  It is
the clop-clop of horse's hoofs and the ringing of wheels on
the cobble stones.  She looks up and tries to raise herself
in her wheel chair to see over the parapet.  She is unable to
do so.  She calls out to her mother.

GEORGINA
Mommie!  Mommie!

MED. FULL SHOT -- Georgina in the f.g.  Fettes and Mrs. Marsh
turn to go toward her.

GEORGINA (cont'd)
Push me to the wall, Mommie.  I
think I hear him.

Fettes takes a few long steps and comes up to the wheel
chair.

FETTES
Hear him?

GEORGINA
The white horse.  The horse that is
going to greet me when he sees me.

FETTES
(as he starts to wheel the
chair toward the parapet)
An old acquaintance, eh?

Georgina nods.  He gets her as far as the wall and she looks
over.  She peers down, then turns back with a look of
disappointment on her face.

DOWN SHOT -- from the Ramparts.  On the street below a
carriage is passing drawn by a brown horse.

MED. CLOSE SHOT -- Georgina and Fettes.

GEORGINA
(disappointed)
It was a brown horse.

Mrs. Marsh comes up.

MRS. MARSH
A cabby told her his horse would
say "hello" to her the next time he
saw her.  Georgina has been looking
everywhere for that horse.

Fettes looks at the child, smiling, then leans down so as to
bring himself on a level with her.

FETTES
Why do you want the white horse to
bid you "good-day"?

GEORGINA
He was a nice horse.

FETTES
Maybe there's another reason. 
Maybe you haven't friends enough. 
Could that be it, Georgina?

Georgina looks at him, thinks a moment, then nods her head.

GEORGINA
Of course -- I don't have friends. 
That's because I can't walk.  I try
to make myself used to it.

FETTES
One shouldn't get used to the wrong
things, Georgina.  You want to walk
and run and play.

MRS. MARSH
(not knowing the direction
or purpose of Fettes'
conversation; breaks in)
Really, Mr. Fettes -- I thought you
at least would know how much
Georgina wants that.

Fettes nods.

FETTES
Aye, but I still wonder how much.

GEORGINA
(with dreadful sincerity)
I want it --

FETTES
But you'll have to stand great
pain, Georgina.  Greater pain than
you ever dreamed of in the worst
time of your sickness.  Do you want
it that much?

Georgina nods.

FETTES (cont'd)
Then, Dr. MacFarlane will make you
well.

He smiles at her and although this direct conversation about
her illness has brought tears to her eyes, Georgina smiles
back at him and Mrs. Marsh, looking down at them, smiles too. 
In her eyes also are tears.

WIPE DISSOLVE

_*INT. MACFARLANE'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY*_

MacFarlane is seated in a wing chair before the fire. 
Although it is near noon, he still wears dressing gown and
slippers.  His hair is rumpled and his eyes bloodshot.  He
has a glass in his left hand and holds a poker in his right. 
With the poker he tries to push a big piece of cannel coal
into the flames.  It eludes the point of the poker and rolls
back against the hobb.  Again he pushes it forward.  Again it
rolls back.  Suddenly, and with almost maniacal rage, he
lifts up the poker and brings it crashing down on the coal. 
The soft coal splinters into a hundred pieces.  Suddenly,
from behind him comes a woman's soft and teasing laughter. 
He turns.  Meg Cameron stands in the doorway behind him.  She
comes quickly across the room to him.

MEG
(as she walks)
Gray's head -- is that it, Teddy? 
Is that what broke just now under
the poker.  Broken it -- and have
done with him forever.

By the time and she has finished her speech, Meg has reached
him and before he has had a chance to even react to her
teasing, mocking tones, she has flung herself down on her
knees beside his chair, thrown her arms about his neck and
kissed him passionately.

MEG (cont'd)
My poor lad -- my poor, poor lad
that can never be free of him.

MACFARLANE
You're daft.  What's Gray to me. 
He's only a man from whom I buy
what I need when I need it -- the
rest is forgotten.

MEG
You may deny the devil, Toddy, but
you'll not rid yourself of him by
saying the devil is dead.

MACFARLANE
Nonsense.  You're a fey creature
with mad ideas.  But you have a
wildness that holds me to you,
lass.

MEG
(quite sure of her ground)
No great lady will ever take my
place?

MacFarlane shakes his head.  He kisses her.  She clings to
him.  It is at this moment that there is a knocking at the
door.  Meg rises quickly and adjusts her clothing. 
MacFarlane tries to seem more at ease.

MACFARLANE
Come in.

Fettes comes in.

MACFARLANE (cont'd)
I didn't expect to see you on
Sunday, Fettes.  What do you want,
some powders for your aching head? 
That was a furious lot we drank
last night -- and in bad company.

FETTES
It was about last night I wanted to
talk to you -- about the operation
on the little Marsh girl.

MACFARLANE
(loftily)
You're a man of the world, Fettes,
you wouldn't hold me to promise
given in drink.

FETTES
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met
Mrs. Marsh and told her.

MACFARLANE
(beginning to lose
patience)
Really, Fettes, you irk me with
your lack of understanding.

FETTES
But you did promise.

MACFARLANE
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor
anyone else knows enough about the
spinal column and its intricacies
to insure success in such an
operation.  I would have to study
the matter.  Have we any
"subjects"?

FETTES
Wilmont used up the last spinal
section.

MACFARLANE
You see, it is completely out of
the question.

FETTES
(very disappointed)
Yes, I suppose so.

MACFARLANE
Now you run off and see that pretty
Mrs. Marsh and explain to her.

Fettes, dejected and disappointed, nods and slowly leaves the
room.  MacFarlane watches him go.

_*INT. ANATOMY ROOM -- DAY*_

CLOSE SHOT -- Joseph at the desk.  He has the account book
open before him and with index finger moving from letter to
letter, he is laboriously but silently spelling out the
words.  Suddenly, he hears footsteps behind him on the stairs
and quickly slams the book and begins dusting the desk.

FULL SHOT -- The anatomy room from Joseph's ANGLE.  Fettes is
coming down the stairs and crosses toward him.

FETTES
Joseph --

Joseph looks up.

FETTES (cont'd)
Would you know a spinal column if
you saw one?

Joseph nods and grins.

FETTES (cont'd)
Do we have one?

Joseph shakes his head.  Fettes shrugs.  He stands thinking
for a moment, then speaks to Joseph again.

FETTES (cont'd)
Joseph --

Joseph looks up again.

FETTES (cont'd)
-- do you happen to know where
Gray, the cabman, lives?

Joseph nods.

FETTES (cont'd)
Well, tell me.

Joseph leans meditatively on the desk.

FETTES (cont'd)
What do you want me to do, bribe
you?  I'm cursed if I do.  Tell me
straight out.  Where does he live?

JOSEPH
I'd gladly run with a message, sir,
for a florin.  It's not much,
considering it's Sunday.

FETTES
I only want his address.

JOSEPH
He lives in the Westport --

Fettes nods.

JOSEPH (cont'd)
(in a last desperate
effort)
I'd gladly go.

But Fettes has already passed into the entry way.

DISSOLVE OUT

_*EXT. DARK ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT*_

It is a crooked, narrow alley.  The only light comes from the
ends.  Fettes can begin to hear the ballad of the street
singer from the street toward which he is going.  He pauses a
moment, listens, then walks forward into the darkness; the
song almost seeming to guide him through the dark alley.

He comes to the darkest portion of the alley.  A sound from
the left attracts his attention.  He comes to an abrupt halt
as something white and mysterious moves on a window sill at
his eye level.  He takes a half step backward as a white cat
leaps down and scurries noiselessly across his path.  Fettes
grins at his own fright and goes on.  He passes through the
darkness and comes out into the dim light of the other
street.  He comes to the street corner and on the corner
stands the street singer.  She is singing her little song and
jingling a few coins in her begging bowl to attract the
attention of the few people passing by in this dismal street. 
Fettes goes up to her.  She stops singing.

FETTES
Do you know where Mr. Gray lives --
Gray, the cabman?

The girl shakes her head.

FETTES (cont'd)
Well, thanks anyhow.

He takes a coin from his pocket and drops it into her bowl. 
He goes off and the CAMERA MOVES IN to a BIG CLOSEUP of the
girl as she resumes her song.

LONG SHOT -- Fettes as he walks.  This alley, like the other
grows darker toward the center.  There is an arch leading to
a court.  Fettes turns left under this arch.

_*EXT. GRAY'S DWELLING AND STABLE -- NIGHT*_

It is a tiny, narrow squalid building.  He looks at it, sees
the name, "John Gray -- Cabman" written on a board across the
door, goes up to it and knocks.  As there is no answer, he
pushes the door open and steps into almost Stygian darkness.

_*INT. GRAY'S STABLE -- NIGHT*_

Fettes gropes his way along the wall toward the stairs. 
Suddenly from the darkness looms a tremendous white figure. 
It is the cabman's horse.  His first momentary fright over,
Fettes pats the horse's nose, passes on to the stairs, climbs
the brief flight of steps leading to a door from under which
comes a ray of light.  Again he knocks.  A voice shouts out
to him.

GRAY'S VOICE
Come in -- come in.

Fettes thrusts open the door and looks around to see the room
in which he finds himself.  It is a large loft-like room,
furnished with odds and ends of poor furniture.  The best
pieces in the room are two dilapidated easy chairs that have
obviously seen better days.  On one wall some spare harness
is hung.  A great battered wardrobe contains Gray's clothes. 
The floor is covered with two worn Turkey carpets.  There is
a bed on which the bedclothes are untidily tumbled.  There is
a washstand and pitcher.  Quite evidently Gray uses this
chamber as a combined living, dining and bedroom as well as a
kitchen.  This last is the purpose to which it is being put
as Fettes enters.  Gray, in shirt sleeves, is crouched over
the embers of the fire in the hearth, stirring some sausages
in a frying pan.  The kettle steams busily on the hob.  On a
small table near the fire is a loaf of bread, a jug of ale, a
wooden trencher, a clasp knife and a fork.  As Fettes enters,
Gray rises and goes to meet him with the frying pan still in
his left hand.

GRAY
So it's the young doctor come to
see me.  I'm honored -- honored --

There is a curious, almost triumphant undertone in his voice.

GRAY (cont'd)
Here, take this.  It is the most
comfortable chair.

He guides Fettes to a chair and Fettes, without removing his
coat, sits down.

With quick servile civility he crosses to the taboret, gets a
glass and bottle and brings it back with him.  He pours a
glass for Fettes.

Fettes takes a swallow.

GRAY (cont'd)
And to what do I owe this honor of
this visit?  Some business, was it,
of Dr. MacFarlane's?

FETTES
Dr. MacFarlane didn't send me.  I
came of my own accord.

He breaks off, taking another swig from his glass.

FETTES (cont'd)
What are the chances of your being
able to get us a "subject"?

GRAY
(shaking his head)
It would be difficult -- very
difficult.  There was a dog that
bothered me during the last job --
people seem so concerned about dogs
-- all in all it raised the very
mother and father of a row.  I'm
told the kirkyards are to be
guarded.
(pausing)
But I would not like to say that it
would be impossible to get a
"subject".

A look of relief comes over Fettes' face.  He picks up his
glass and drinks again.

FETTES
(leaning forward)
But how soon, man?  Dr. MacFarlane
is engaged in some very urgent
research at present.  He can't wait
very long.

Again Gray smiles.

GRAY
I fear he may have to.

FETTES
But can't you give me any idea?

GRAY
How could I?  I will do my best. 
After all, you see, I am
financially interested.

The CAMERA PULLS BACK to a WIDER ANGLE as Fettes gets to his
feet abruptly.  Where comes very faintly over the shot from
somewhere outside, the voice of the street singer, singing
the same melody.

GRAY (cont'd)
You may tell Toddy that I will do
what I can, when I can -- as he
knows I will.
(sighing)
But he must wait and see as the
children do.

FETTES
If that's your answer -- it'll have
to do.

Fettes turns abruptly away and goes quickly out of scene
toward the door.  Gray sits for a moment, reflecting, then
gets to his feet.  The CAMERA PANS WITH him as he goes to the
door and out.

_*EXT. STREET -- NIGHT*_

MED. FULL SHOT -- at the far side of the street, Fettes can
be seen striding.  At the nearer side, approaching slowly, is
the street singer.

_*INT. GRAY'S STABLE -- NIGHT*_

CLOSE SHOT -- Gray.  His head is turned in the direction of
the voice.  His hand comes up to his chin as he rubs at it
reflectively, obviously seized by an idea.  He makes up his
mind and turns into the stable.

MED. SHOT.  It is dark.  In the f.g. is the white horse.  It
turns as Gray comes into scene and nuzzles him affectionately
as he pats it.

GRAY
Ah, Friend!  There's bad news for
you, boy -- bad news -- 

He pulls out a lump of sugar and gives it to the horse.

GRAY (cont'd)
We have to go out again, Friend.

He turns away into the darkness, but is back in a moment
bearing the horse's collar.  As he slips the collar over the
animal's head --

DISSOLVE

_*EXT. STREET -- NIGHT*_

It is a long deserted street.  At the near end a lantern on a
house wall casts a sphere of dim radiance.  The CAMERA is
FOCUSED DOWN the street which ends in Stygian darkness.  From
behind the camera comes the street singer, walking slowly,
singing and rattling her begging bowl.  She walks on.  Just
before her figure is lost in the darkness, from behind the
camera can be heard the clop-clop of hoofs, the creak of
carriage springs, and the rolling wheels of Gray's cab.  As
the singer disappears completely into the darkness, the cab
goes past the camera.  It, too, disappears into the darkness. 
The CAMERA HOLDS.  The sound of the carriage ceases.  A
moment later, the song of the street singer comes to an
abrupt, choked end.

LONG DISSOLVE OUT

DISSOLVE IN

_*INT. FETTES BEDROOM -- NIGHT*_

At a small table, seated on a high stool, is Fettes.  A
little lamp burns dimly at his elbow and by its light he is
studying.  He turns the pages, checks some point in his
reading with an anatomical chart spread over the table and
with his pencil still poised over the anatomical chart, he
pauses, listening.  From some distance away comes the sound
of a horse's hoofs and the banging of wheels.  Fettes rises
and crosses to the window.  He draws the curtains aside and
pushes open the casement.  With the window open and sound of
the horse's hoofs is louder.  He looks down.

_*EXT. ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT*_

SHOOTING DOWNWARD as if from Fettes' viewpoint.  Gray's cab
pulled by the white horse comes into the scene and stops.

_*INT. FETTES BEDROOM -- NIGHT*_

Fettes turns away from the window and starts for the door.

_*EXT. ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT*_

Gray gets off the cab.

_*INT. ANATOMY ROOM -- NIGHT*_

Fettes passing through.

_*INT. THE ENTRY WAY -- NIGHT*_

Fettes opens the door, admitting Gray.  He comes in carrying
the usual canvas-colored body, but this burden is lighter
than the last.  Without any difficulty he takes it into the
adjoining room.

_*INT. ANATOMY ROOM -- NIGHT*_

Gray lays his burden down upon the table.

GRAY
(cheerfully)
There, Master Fettes.  Sooner than
we had expected.  A stoke of luck
one might say.

FETTES
Good.

He is still almost half asleep as he starts over toward the
desk pulling the key from his pocket as he goes.  As he does
so, his eyes light on the face of the corpse, revealed on his
side by the drooping canvas.  He is startled; takes two steps
nearer and looks again.

FETTES (cont'd)
That's the street singer.

Gray says nothing; merely looks at him calmly.

FETTES (cont'd)
(very much excited)
I know her, I tell you!  She was
alive and hearty only this evening. 
It's impossible she can be dead.

He pauses.  Then in a lower voice.

FETTES (cont'd)
You could not have gotten this body
fairly.

Gray looks at him with a cold, hard look.

GRAY
You are entirely mistaken.

The two men stand facing each other.  There is even a hint of
physical violence in Gray's stooped crouch.

GRAY (cont'd)
You had better give me my money and
make the proper entry.

He stares Fettes down and the boy crosses over to the desk
and hurriedly gets out the money.  He crosses over and gives
it to Gray.  Gray looks at it and then at the boy.

GRAY (cont'd)
Good night, Dr. Fettes.

He tips his hat and is quickly gone.  Fettes goes back to the
body and looks down at the dead face of the girl.  He
shudders.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN

_*INT. ANATOMY ROOM -- DAY*_

CLOSE FULL SHOT -- the stairway.  The door at the top of the
stairs opens and MacFarlane comes through with an early
morning shine upon his countenance; his hair sleek from
brushing.  He is adjusting his tie and is whistling a
Scottish tune as he descends the stairs.  He suddenly breaks
off as he sees someone below him on the floor level of the
anatomy room.

MACFARLANE
(heartily)
Well, well, good morning to you,
young Master Fettes.

REVERSE SHOT.  Fettes is completely dressed, but his haggard
face and rumpled hair give evidence of a sleepless night.

FETTES
Dr. MacFarlane, have you ever seen
a street singer who sang "The Twa
Corby"?

They start toward the table where the body lies.  The CAMERA
BEGINS TO TRUCK WITH them.

MACFARLANE
Every street singer with a cracked
voice gives tongue to that one.

FETTES
This girl was beautiful -- a wild
lassie from the Highlands.

MacFarlane shrugs.

MACFARLANE
Beautiful, you say? It's a wonder I
have not remarked her.

They have reached the table and both me look down.

MACFARLANE (cont'd)
Oh, this girl.

He whistles a bar or two of her song.

_*INT. RECESS NEAR BRINE VAT -- DAY*_

Joseph, comfortably seated on a three-legged stool near the
brine vat and contentedly sucking at an old clay pipe, hears
the doctor's whistled tune.  He leans forward without rising,
parts the curtain to look out. 

FETTES' VOICE
She was murdered.

Joseph softly rises from his stool, taking care to let the
legs of this seat go back quietly onto the floor.  He puts
himself into an attitude of intense listening.

_*INT. ANATOMY ROOM -- DAY*_

MED. CLOSE SHOT on MacFarlane and Fettes.

FETTES
I went to see Gray last night.  I
asked him to bring us a specimen. 
On my way I saw this girl.  I gave
her alms money.  She was alive and
singing.

He points to her temple.  MacFarlane looks down.

MACFARLANE
Well --

FETTES
Gray killed her.

MACFARLANE
We can't be sure of that.

FETTES
I am sure.  I mean to report it. 
It's like Burke and Hare all over
again.

MacFarlane studies him for a long moment.

MACFARLANE
(very quietly)
I wouldn't do that, Fettes.  I
wouldn't report it.

FETTES
Grave robbing is one thing -- this
is murder.

CLOSE SHOT -- Joseph at the curtain.  He is turning away.  He
has heard enough, and the calculating look in his eyes has
been replaced by one of triumphant decision.

MED. SHOT -- Fettes and MacFarlane.

MACFARLANE
I don't know that -- neither do
you.  This subject may have been an
epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen
out of bed -- cracked her skull and
killed herself -- there is
everything explained -- the bruise
on her head --

FETTES
I can't believe that.

MACFARLANE
Believe it or not.  It's best for
you to pretend that you do.  After
all, it was you who ordered this
specimen, received it here, and
paid for it.  That makes you a
party to murder.

Fettes looks at MacFarlane.  The truth of what the doctor has
said is borne in upon him.  He is confused and bewildered.

FETTES
But, I didn't ask him to kill.

MACFARLANE
Who would believe that?  And you
know, someone else might recognize
her.  She was as well known as the
Castle Rock.

MacFarlane looks over at him.

MACFARLANE (cont'd)
I should advise complete
dissection.

MacFarlane starts to pull back the canvas from the body.

MACFARLANE (cont'd)
I'll help you, of course.

Fettes hesitates.  MacFarlane throws back the canvas sheet.

MED. CLOSE TWO SHOT -- Fettes and MacFarlane.

MACFARLANE (cont'd)
I want the whole centrum myself for
spinal work -- you know why --

Fettes understands, smiles and moves forward to help the
doctor lift the body.

FADE OUT

FADE IN

_*INT. MACFARLANE'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY*_

It is a bright afternoon and there is no fire on the hearth. 
Mrs. Marsh is seated on the sofa and Meg sits beside her.  A
tea service on a small table is between them.  Georgina's
empty wheel-chair is in evidence.

MEG
(pushing a cup of tea
toward Mrs. Marsh)
Have a drop -- it'll help.

Mrs. Marsh shakes her head.  Between her hands is a
handkerchief which she is twisting nervously.

MRS. MARSH
I couldn't swallow it.

She makes a nervous desperate gesture with her handkerchief;
glances wildly at the clock.

MRS. MARSH (cont'd)
How long has it been?

Meg Cameron also glances at the clock.

MEG
Only twenty minutes.

MRS. MARSH
(desperately echoing)
Only twenty minutes.

_*INT. ANATOMY ROOM -- DAY*_

LONG SHOT.  The room no longer has its ordinary arrangements. 
The tables and benches have been pulled up around the central
marble-topped table for use as an impromptu grandstands. 
Students are standing on the tables and benches, peering down
in tense and silent excitement at something on the table. 
There is the sound of a child's groan; a gasp of pain.

CLOSE FULL SHOT -- the circle around the table.  Georgina
partially covered by a sheet, lies on the slab.  MacFarlane
in shirt sleeves and apron bends over her. Richardson and
some other students are close around him.  Fettes crouches at
the head of the table; his face near that of the child.  This
is a very low camera setup which hides the actual business of
the operation from the audience, but which allows them to see
the reactions to it on the faces of the students.

MACFARLANE
Here is where you must watch
closely, gentleman -- closely -- it
is the very heart of the matter --

FETTES
Wait, Doctor -- wait!  The child's
fainting.

The two big students who are holding the tiny thin arms of
the girl to hold her down look questioningly at MacFarlane.

MACFARLANE
Give her some brandy if you want.

Fettes shakes his head.

FETTES
She's unconscious.

MACFARLANE
Pulse?

RICHARDSON
Slow -- but not too alarming.

MACFARLANE
Let us proceed.

He bends to his work again.

MACFARLANE (cont'd)
(commenting as he goes)
-- and the final step -- we push
the ganglia to one side -- then we
make the actual osseous incision
here -- so -- it is done -- the
repair is effected and nothing left
to do but replace the tissue and
let nature heal what is no longer a
defect -- merely a wound --

RICHARDSON
(softly; but with feeling)
Bravo!

MACFARLANE
(to Fettes)
I'll be finished with her in an
instant.  Then you can consider her
your patient, Fettes.

Fettes looks his gratitude.

FADE OUT

FADE IN

_*INT. ANATOMY ROOM -- DAY*_

It is late afternoon and only MacFarlane is there working at
his desk.  Suddenly Joseph comes in from the entry on tiptoe. 
He gets up to within a few feet of MacFarlane before
announcing himself.

JOSEPH
Doctor --

MacFarlane wheels around.

MACFARLANE
What the devil is the matter with
you -- forever creeping about. 
What do you want?

JOSEPH
Mr. Gray --

MACFARLANE
I don't wish to see Mr. Gray.

Behind him Gray, grinning, comes out from the darkness of the
entry way and stands listening.  The doctor is unaware of his
presence.  He turns back to his work.

MACFARLANE (cont'd)
You tell him that there will be no
more business between us.

Gray grins even more broadly, then he clears his throat with
a rumbling couch.  MacFarlane turns around.

MACFARLANE (cont'd)
Oh -- well, Joseph, it seems I will
have the pleasure of speaking to
Mr. Gray myself.  You can go.

Both men wait for Joseph to go into the alcove.

GRAY
Now that wasn't a friendly thing I
heard, Toddy.  Not at all friendly.

MACFARLANE
That has nothing to do with it. 
We've decided to do more lecturing
and less dissection -- it's better
for the students -- that's all
there is to it.

GRAY
(starting to leave)
You know what you want and don't
want -- so that's an end of
business between us -- but we'll
still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be
dropping by to see you and Meg once
in a while -- for auld lang syne,
you know.

MACFARLANE
I suppose we can't prevent that,
Gray --
(bitterly)
-- for auld lang syne.

Gray turns very humbly and goes to the door, then he turns
again and he is laughing.

GRAY
And do you think you're getting rid
of me, Toddy?

MacFarlane, who has turned back to his desk, whirls about,
but Gray has already disappeared into the darkness of the
entry way and from thence comes his loud crowing laughter. 
The doctor's face clouds in anger.  He turns back to his
desk.  The street door can be heard closing.

_*EXT. MACFARLANE'S CLOSE -- DAY*_

Gray, still laughing, comes out on the sidewalk to find
Joseph waiting for him.  Chuckling to himself,  Gray starts
to cross to his cab.  Joseph stops him.

JOSEPH
I would like to speak to you.

Gray looks at him.

GRAY
I presume you shall.  This won't be
my last visit here.

JOSEPH
I want to speak to you alone.  I
saw something.  I heard.

GRAY
What did you hear?

JOSEPH
I know --

He looks off and sees Fettes coming down the alley.  Fettes
is whistling to himself.

JOSEPH (cont'd)
Maybe some other time --

GRAY
(beginning to laugh again)
Oh, you'll have ample opportunity --
ample --
(to Fettes)
Good morning, Dr. Fettes.

FETTES
Good morning.

_*INT. ANATOMY ROOM -- DAY*_

The doctor turns as Fettes comes in.

FETTES
I just saw Gray.  What was he
laughing at?

MACFARLANE
He has his own idea of a joke. 
Perhaps his horse tickled him in
the ribs.

FETTES
I've just been to see Mrs. Marsh. 
Georgina is doing splendidly.  The
incision has healed -- clean and
fine -- but she doesn't seem to
have any desire to walk.

MACFARLANE
When she's ready you bring her to
me -- I'll show her how.

FETTES
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you
know what happiness you've brought
those people.

MACFARLANE
That's only our duty, Fettes --
that's the end at which we aim with
all this nasty business.

He makes a gesture to include the anatomy room.

FETTES
(very sincerely)
I suppose one must pass through
this purgatory to the heaven of
being a good doctor.

MACFARLANE
(turning to his desk)
That's the way of it, Fettes.  You
bring the lassie to me.

FADE OUT

FADE IN

_*INT. DR. MACFARLANE'S STUDY -- DAY*_

The doctor, Fettes, Mrs. Marsh and Georgina are all together. 
Georgina is seated in her little wheelchair.  The doctor
stands before her, looming above her, glowering with ill
concealed rage.  Fettes kneels at the side of the wheelchair,
while Mrs. Marsh sits nervously perched on the sofa.

FETTES
Don't you want to find the white
horse, Georgina?  You can't find
him from a wheelchair.  You have to
walk and run to find him.

GEORGINA
I can't.

MACFARLANE
(thundering)
You can't -- can't!
(to Fettes)
Stop trying to bribe her with
childishness about white horses. 
Let the child stand and walk -- her
spine's all right.  I know it's all
right.

FETTES
But she must want to stand.  She
must want to walk.

MACFARLANE
(still in a towering rage)
Confound me, the child's a cripple,
of course she wants to walk.
(to Georgina)
Child, I say to you get up out of
that chair and walk.

Georgina bursts into tears.  MacFarlane makes a disgusted
gesture.

MACFARLANE (cont'd)
(trying to control
himself)
I ask you, child, to do a simple
thing -- raise yourself with your
hands to a standing posture -- then
step out with your left foot -- try
it.

Georgina shakes her head.

MACFARLANE (cont'd)
I say, try it!  Lift yourself up
now!

Georgina lifts herself up by her hands to a semistanding
posture.

MACFARLANE (cont'd)
Good.  Now step out.

The child stands still.

MACFARLANE (cont'd)
Step out!

GEORGINA
I can't!  I can't!  My legs won't
move.

MACFARLANE
(almost screaming)
Nonsense!

Mrs. Marsh rises from the sofa and comes to join them.

MRS. MARSH
I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a
good child -- a brave child -- you
saw how she was during the
operation -- but if she can't move,
she can't move.

MACFARLANE
But she must be able to move. 
Everything is in place.

MRS. MARSH
(shaking her head)
She would if she could.

MACFARLANE
Then all my surgery is no good. 
There's something wrong with the
child -- something I don't know --
something I can't define -- can't
diagnose.
(pause)
I can do nothing for her.

When he finishes his speech there is a long, dead silence. 
MacFarlane is the first to break it.

MACFARLANE (cont'd)
You see Mrs. Marsh home, Fettes,
I'm going to Hobbs'.  You can join
me there if you like.

Fettes nods.  Picking up his hat MacFarlane starts from the
door.

DISSOLVE OUT

DISSOLVE IN

_*INT. HOBBS' PUBLIC HOUSE - NIGHT*_

It is quite late and there are only a few patrons in the
public house. At the bar, with his hat on his head and his
whip in one hand, Gray sits on a stool drinking some hot
liquid from a pewter tankard. The drawing-waiter is leaning
on the bar talking to him.

GRAY
(setting down the mug)
Well, I'll be off -- unless you
have a fare for me here -- some
gentleman a little taken with wine.

WAITER
Wait a bit and MacFarlane will
be wanting to be freighted home.

GRAY
The Doctor MacFarlane?

WAITER
Aye. In the other room and
getting stiffer than the bodies he
demonstrates.

GRAY
I'll look in on him.

Gray slouches across the room to the divan. He peers in. 

MED. CLOSE SHOT -- MacFarlane in the divan FROM GRAY'S ANGLE.
There is a squat bottle before him and two small glasses. He
is hunched over. His hair is rumpled. He is brooding. From
the entrance of the divan, Gray speaks to him.

GRAY (CONT'D)
Toddy --

MacFarlane looks up.

MACFARLANE
(with drunken
friendliness)
Oh, it's you, Gray. Well, come in.
Sit down. Have a glass with me.

GRAY
(removing his hat and
sitting down)
You're uncommon friendly tonight,
Toddy. More like the old days.

MacFarlane drunkenly nods his head.

MACFARLANE
I want someone to talk to. That
Fettes -- all taken up with the
widow. He never came back here. 

He looks up at Gray.

MACFARLANE (CONT'D)
You know something about the human
body, Gray.

GRAY
I've had some experience.

MACFARLANE
Then you can understand that the
backbone is a lot of little
blocks and those little blocks are
all held together, so that it works
like that whip of yours. You know
that, don't you?

GRAY
I've never had it all explained
that way to me by so learned a man.

MACFARLANE
(disregarding the sarcasm)
I set those blocks together,
patched the muscles. I put the
nerves where they should be -- I
did it and I did it right -- and
she won't walk --

GRAY
(beginning to understand)
Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes
was talking about.

MACFARLANE
(thumping his hand on the
table)
The same. Look here, Gray --

He picks up two glasses.

MACFARLANE (CONT'D)
I fitted them together like this --
(he puts the two glasses
together)
-- so that it was right. Yet she
won't walk.

Gray looks at him. He is grinning his malicious grin. With a
sudden sweep of his hand across the table he knocks down the
glasses.

GRAY
You can't build life like you put
together blocks, Toddy.

MACFARLANE
What are you talking about? I am an
anatomist. I know the body. I know
how it works.

GRAY
And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no
doctor. It's only the dead ones
that you know.

MACFARLANE
I am a doctor. I teach medicine.

GRAY
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught
you? In cellars and graveyards? Did
Knox teach you what makes the blood
flow?

MACFARLANE
The heart pumps it.

GRAY
Did he tell you how thoughts come
and how they go and why things are
remembered and forgot?

MACFARLANE
The nerve centers -- the brain --

GRAY
But what makes a thought start?

MACFARLANE
(fuzzily)
In the brain, I tell you. I know.

GRAY
You don't know and you'll never
know or understand, Toddy. Not from
me or from Knox would you learn
those things. Look --

He points to a mirror behind MacFarlane's head.  MacFarlane
looks into it.

MIRROR SHOT showing MacFarlane looking at his own face and
the evil face of Gray just behind him.

GRAY (CONT'D)
Look at yourself, Toddy, could you
be a doctor -- a healing man --
with the things those eyes have
seen? There's a lot of knowledge in
those eyes, but there's no
understanding. You'd not get that
from me. 

MacFarlane whirls around.

ANOTHER ANGLE - MacFarlane facing Gray.

MACFARLANE
I am a doctor - a good doctor. I
could make her walk, but she won't 
- she won't --

GRAY
(almost kindly, as he
pours a drink)
Here, have another glass,
MacFarlane. I'll take you home and
we'll be friends again -- now that
you know that you're Knox's man and
my friend -- aye, forever.

MacFarlane swallows the drink at a single draught.

MACFARLANE
I'm my own man and I'll have no
more to do with you, Gray. 

Gray lifts his eyebrows quizzically.

MACFARLANE (CONT'D)
Why should I be afraid of you? What
are you holding over me?

GRAY
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's
because I ran down the streets with
the mud and the stones around my
ears and the mob yelling for my
blood. It's because you were afraid
to face it -- and you're still
afraid.

MACFARLANE
No, I'm not afraid. Tell!
Shout it from the housetops!
(dropping his voice)
And remember this -- they
hanged Burke -- they mobbed
Hare -- but Dr. Knox is living
like a gentleman in London.

MacFarlane rises drunkenly to his feet, There is a threat of
physical violence in his manner.

GRAY
(somewhat placatingly; for
the first time not
completely master of the
situation)
Aye, Toddy, there is something
in what you say.

MACFARLANE
There is much in what I say, Gray,
and if you have any regard for your
neck you'll leave now and stay away
from my house, my school, and from
me.

GRAY
I have no wish for a rope cravat.
I've never liked the smell of hemp,
so I'll bid you good night, Doctor
MacFarlane.

Gray picks up his hat and starts off out of scene. MacFarlane
slumps back into his seat. His hand reaches out for the
whiskey bottle. He starts to pour another drink.

DISSOLVE

_*INT. GRAY'S STABLE - NIGHT*_

By the light of a single lantern, Gray is unharnessing his
horse. He leads it out from between the shafts and into its
stall. There is a furtive sound before him as the door to the
street slowly moves open. He wheels quickly as a slight,
hunched figure sidles through the door. Gray waits until the
figure walks into the range of the lamp and is revealed as
Joseph. Then he speaks.

GRAY
Ah -- Dr. MacFarlane's man -- A
surprise visit, but come in -- come
in.

He steps aside, and Joseph slowly moves over toward the
stairway, looking around him.

MED. SHOT as Gray leads Joseph into the living quarters and
looks curiously at Joseph, who returns the look with a sort
of determined belligerence.

GRAY (CONT'D)
You're welcome to my little
nest, Joseph -- is it not? That's
right -- you have something to say
to  me -- something very private.

JOSEPH
Yes.

GRAY
Now that is very interesting --
(with a gesture)
Take a chair, Joseph,

Joseph seats himself and Gray sits down opposite him.  No
sooner has he seated himself than the big white cat, his pet,
comes and jumps upon his knee. Gray strokes it fondly.

JOSEPH
(looking around)
Can anyone hear what we say?

GRAY
(indicating the cat)
Only Brother.

JOSEPH
(bending toward him)
I know that you kill people to sell
bodies. 

Gray sits motionless except that the hand which rests upon
the arm of his chair slowly tenses and that other hand which
strokes the cat, stops at the cat's head.  For a long moment
he is silent, then he speaks very softly.

GRAY
You say you've come here on your
own account?  No one knows you are
here?

JOSEPH
Give me money or I'll tell the
police you murder the "subjects." 

Again there is a silence as Gray studies him.  By now, Gray's
right hand relaxes.  His left hand begins to stroke the cat. 
Finally, he smiles.

GRAY
Well, you shall have money, Joseph. 
Why should you not?

Still smiling, he very carefully takes the cat from his lap,
sits it on the floor and rises.  Joseph follows him with his
eyes.

GRAY (CONT'D)
(crossing to the taboret
for a bottle and two
glasses)
I don't suppose the great Dr.
MacFarlane is too free with his
pay, is he?

He has come back with the bottle and filled a glass with
brandy for each. He passes a glass into Joseph's hands.

GRAY (CONT'D)
Here -- have some of this.

They both drink. Immediately, Gray refills Joseph's glass.

GRAY (CONT'D)
(as he pours)
You want money and you shall have
it.

He pulls a purse from his pocket and begins to count out
notes and coins.

GRAY (CONT'D)
Let me see -- five and five -- then
in gold -- six all together. Shall
we say sixteen pounds, Joseph?

Joseph, with the glass still at his lips, nods his head. Gray
looks about as if seeking a point of vantage; then carefully
sets himself in a straight-backed chair, facing and a little
to the side of Joseph's chair. Joseph is in a low-cushioned
chair. Gray, being above him, almost seems to hover over him.
Gray leans forward to give him the money.

JOSEPH
I have made you give me money, but
you smile. Aren't you angry?

GRAY
No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here --
another glass of brandy --I'll
wager it's better than the
doctor's.

This time Gray fills Joseph's glass and drabbles a few drops
into his own, but doesn't bother to pick it up.

GRAY (CONT'D)
Drink up, man!

The liquor has begun to affect Joseph. He takes the third
glass eagerly and drains it while Gray watches him in
silence. As he puts the glass down, Gray begins to speak.

GRAY (CONT'D)
I have an idea -- a splendid idea --
such an excellent idea that we must
drink on it.

He fills the fourth glass. Joseph takes it but does not
drink, as he is interested to hear Gray's proposition,

GRAY (CONT'D)
You see -- I admire you, Joseph.
Coming here shows courage. I'm
looking for such a man -- but --
drink, Joseph, drink..

Joseph drinks. Again Gray keeps silent while he swallows the
liquor. As Joseph puts down the glass, Gray hitches his chair
forward an inch or two. Again he refills the glass; puts it
into Joseph's unsteady hand.

GRAY (CONT'D)
You and I should work together.

JOSEPH
You mean we would sell the bodies
to the doctors together? Dig them
up?

GRAY
(smiling)
No digging Joseph. The churchyards
are too well guarded. We will
"Burke" them,

JOSEPH
(puzzled)
Burke them?

GRAY
You are lately come to Scotland,
Joseph?

JOSEPH
I come from Lisbon.

GRAY
But still you may have heard the
peddlers of verse cry out their
names on the streets.

He begins to sing in a rough croaking voice.

GRAY (CONT'D)
"The ruffian dogs, the Hellish
pair.  The villain Burke, the
meager Hare --"

JOSEPH
I never heard that song. But what
did they do?

GRAY
Eighteen persons they killed and
sold the bodies to Dr. Knox at ten
pounds for a large and eight pounds
for a small. That's good business,
Joseph. 

Joseph nods appreciatively, then looks concerned.

JOSEPH
But where did they get those
people?

GRAY
That was Hare's end. Ah, you should
have seen him on the streets, when
he saw some old beldam deep in
drink how he cozened her!

He mimics, tipping an imaginary hat.

GRAY (CONT'D)
"A good-day to you Madame Tosspot,
and would you like a little glass
of something before you take your
rest? Come with me to my house and
I'll make you my guest. You shall
have quarts to drink if you like."
(appreciatively)
Ah, how he cozened them.

JOSEPH
We could do that. But when he had
them there, then what?

GRAY
(beginning to sing again)
"Nor did they handle axe or knife
To take away their victim's life --
No sooner done than in a chest
They crammed their lately welcome
guest." 

Gray rubs his hands together.

JOSEPH
I don't understand the song. Tell
me plain how they did it.

GRAY
(rising)
I'll show you how it was done,
Joseph. -- I'll show you how they
"Burked" them.

He reaches out for Joseph's face. Joseph interposes his arm.

GRAY (CONT'D)
No, put your hand down. How can I
show you, man!

Joseph lets his hand swing to his lap. Gray clasps Joseph's
nose between thumb and forefinger, cupping Joseph's chin hard
against the heel of his palm. 

CLOSE SHOT - Joseph with Gray's hand holding his nose and
mouth.

GRAY'S VOICE
This is how they did it, Joseph.

Suddenly his hand tenses. Joseph's eyes dilate with terror
and his head jerks to one side violently as he attempts to
tear his face from the grasp of Gray's hand. 

MED. CLOSE SHOT - Gray steadily clutching Joseph's face. He
throws himself upon the other man and the chair slowly goes
backward. ANOTHER ANGLE. The two men are on the floor. Gray
is lying across the body of his victim, his hand still
clutching Joseph's nose and mouth. Joseph struggles
convulsively, throwing his arms and legs about, trying to get
at Gray's body which lies athwart him. With his free hand
Gray pins down Joseph's right hand. The man is helpless. The
violence of his movements grows less and less. For a moment
he is still; then he struggles again.

CLOSE SHOT - Joseph.  He is making a final desperate effort
to pull away from Gray's hand, then his face muscles relax.
His eye's close. 

CLOSE FULL SHOT - Gray and Joseph. Gray looks down at his
victim. Joseph is at last unconscious. Gray gets to a
kneeling posture, but still keeps his hand on Joseph's nose
and mouth. 

ANOTHER ANGLE. The cat walks up and rubs itself against
Gray's left arm. He lets go of Joseph's hand and pats the
cat, still keeping his grip on Joseph's mouth and nose. 

CLOSE SHOT - Gray as he examines Joseph. Evidently, Joseph is
dead enough to suit him and he lets go his grip. 

FULL SHOT as Gray gets to his feet. He crosses the room to a
cupboard, opens it and takes out a square of folded canvas.
He starts back toward Joseph and stops on the way to pick up
Joseph's glass from the taboret. He drinks the remainder of
the liquor in it. Gray kneels down beside Joseph and begins
to wrap the canvas about the body. Suddenly, a thought
strikes him, and he puts his hand in Joseph's coat pocket. He
fishes out the money he had given him. He begins wrapping the
canvas around the body again.

DISSOLVE

_*INT. ANATOMY SCHOOL - NIGHT*_

FULL SHOT. The School is in darkness -- except for thin
moonlight which filters through the shutters, making strange
pattern with the shadows. There is no sound until, abruptly,
a key turns in the lock of the outside door. It opens and
through it comes the figure of Gray in his stove-pipe hat and
caped coat. Over his shoulder he carries a long, limp and
apparently heavy bundle wrapped in sacking. Cautiously,
without a sound he carries his grim burden toward the
curtained recess. 

MED. SHOT at recess. Gray comes into shot. He pushes his way
through the curtain, which falls back into place, hiding him
from view. Sounds come from behind the curtain; bumping,
shuffling sounds. Then Gray's hand appears momentarily as it
throws out a bundle of sacking.   After a grunt of effort
comes a heavy splash as something is dropped into the big vat
o.s. 

FULL SHOT - Gray as he comes from the recess and starts
across the anatomy room. When he reaches the stairs he pauses
a moment, and then, instead of going toward the door, turns
and starts up the stairs.

DISSOLVE OUT

DISSOLVE IN

_*INT. MACFARLANE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT*_

A single lamp is burning. Meg, in negligee and mob cap, sits
in an arm chair busily knitting. Opposite her, in a low chair
sits Gray, his whip in his hand and his hat on the back of
his head. He is lounging in the chair and he has a glass of
ale on the floor beside him. He drinks from it and puts it
back on the floor. Meg looks up.

GRAY
You've no need to be so anxious,
Meg, MacFarlane's been drunk and
away before. He'll be home in good
time. Meanwhile, you've got me to
keep you company.

MEG
I'd call that no good fortune.

GRAY
There was a time, lassie -- a time
when I used to bring the dashing
young doctor to your door -- when
you didn't feel so uncommon cold to
your old friend Gray.

MEG
Why must you be on him all the
time? Why does it please you?

GRAY
He's my friend. I like to see my
friends -- I like to visit them --

There is the sound of the front door opening. Both look up.
Heavy dragging footsteps sound in the hall.

MEG
Well, he's come home -- you've no
excuse now to bear me company.

Gray makes no move to get out of his chair. MacFarlane stands
in the doorway. He sees Gray.

MACFARLANE
What are you going here? Have I not
told you --

GRAY
Would you grudge me a glass with my
old crony, Meg?

MEG
Crony indeed!

MACFARLANE
You can get out.

Gray rises leisurely..

GRAY
I brought you something tonight,
MacFarlane -- an interesting
specimen -- in very good condition.

MACFARLANE
I've ordered nothing from you.

GRAY
This is a gift.

MACFARLANE
I take no gifts from you.

GRAY
This is a gift you'll not return.

MACFARLANE
Get out of here!

GRAY
Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable.
I want to discuss business.

MACFARLANE
You are not to set foot in here
again, Gray, for business or any
other reason. And you're going out
now!

He seizes Gray by the shoulder. Gray merely looks at him.

GRAY
(calmly)
I wouldn't do it, Toddy. I wouldn't
be rough handed.

MacFarlane, somewhat taken aback by the calm and effrontery
of the man, lets go of him.

GRAY (CONT'D)
If you were to throw me out, it
might become known that when the
great Dr. MacFarlane finds his
anatomy school without "subjects" --
he provides them himself and from
the midst of his own household ---

ANGLE - THREE SHOT - Gray's manner, fully as much as his
ambiguous speech, has put an end to all thought of violence.

MACFARLANE
What the devil are you talking
about?

Gray rises slowly.

GRAY
Take a look downstairs. Toddy. Take
a look.

He turns and walks quietly out of the room.  MacFarlane
stares after him; than slowly a thought comes to him.

MACFARLANE
Fettes -- where is Fettes?

MEG
I'll get him.

She leaves quickly. When she has left, MacFarlane passes his
hand over his eyes, trying to clear his whiskey-muddled
brain; then he turns and starts for the door of the anatomy
room,

_*INT. ANATOMY ROOM -- NIGHT*_

The school is dark and empty; only moonlight enters from the
windows. The night light is out. MacFarlane comes slowly down
the stairs. As he reaches the foot of the steps, Fettes, in
his bathrobe, comes to the head of the stairs, bearing a
candle. MacFarlane turns to look at him.

MACFARLANE
Fettes, were you down here when
Gray came?

Fettes shakes his head.  MacFarlane starts for the alcove,
and Fettes follows him. MacFarlane pulls the curtain aside.

MACFARLANE (CONT'D)
Bring that candle over here.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - in the recess. It is very dark. The curtain
is drawn back, and MacFarlane appears. The scene is suddenly
illuminated as Fettes follows him, carrying the candle. The
great vat is clearly visible as both men peer down into it.

CLOSE SHOT - the vat, SHOOTING DOWNWARD. Something is
floating just beneath the liquid which comes nearly to the
top of the vet. Light from the candle o.s, comes over the
scene, and the thing below the surface is revealed as the
dead face of Joseph.

TWO SHOT - MacFarlane, as he takes the candle from Fettes'
hand.

MACFARLANE (CONT'D)
(muttering)
-- a member of his household --

MacFarlane turns to Fettes.

MACFARLANE (CONT'D)
Fettes, the more things are wrong,
the more we must act as if
everything were right. You must do
with Joseph as you did with, the
street singer -- complete
dissection -- a proper entry in the
book --

FETTES
No. 

MACFARLANE
What do you mean, Fettes?

FETTES
I'll have no more to do with it.
I'll not put my neck into the
noose, not even for your sake, Dr.
MacFarlane.

MACFARLANE
Don't be a fool.  One can't begin
and then stop -- and because that
entry of the girl's body is in your
hand, you'll do as I say. As for
me, I'll tend to Gray.

MacFarlane turns and starts for the main portion of the
anatomy room.  At the curtain he stops, Meg is standing
there, her eyes wide as she looks at the body of Joseph.

MEG
You're not going to Gray.

MACFARLANE
He must leave me alone.

He starts past her.  She seizes hold of his arm, crying out.

MEG
No!  No!

With a swoop of his arm he frees himself. Meg almost falls.
She strikes against the wall, but recovers herself and starts
after MacFarlane, but it is already too late. He is in the
entryway, and a moment later there is the slam of the door.
Meg stands trembling. Fettes comes up to her and takes her
elbow to support her.

MEG (CONT'D)
Come, Mistress Cameron -- this is
no place for you. I'll help you
upstairs.

She lets him lead her to the stairway. CLOSE TWO SHOT -- on
the stairway as Meg and Fettes start to ascend.  Fettes is
helping Meg. Suddenly she stops dead and stares into his
face.

MEG (CONT'D)
You must leave this house.

FETTES
I can't do that -- you heard
MacFarlane.

MEG
Save yourself. Master Fettes look
at MacFarlane and be warned.

FETTES
He's a great doctor -- a great man --

MEG
Is it a great man whom Gray can
order to his bidding? Is it a great
man who for very shame dare not
acknowledge his own wife so that I
must play maidservant for the
world's sake and his success?

She makes a contemptuous gesture and goes on.

MEG (CONT'D)
He could have been a great man -- a
good man and a fine doctor, but
there was always the shame of the
old life and the old ways to hold
him back -- and always Gray -- Gray
to hound him to his death.

FETTES
You're over-excited, Mistress
Cameron.

MEG
I'm cold as ice.

FETTES
But Gray's only a cab driver -- a
Resurrection Man who robs graves to
make a bit of money now and again.

MEG
If he were only that. The man's
evil himself. Some day you'll know
him as MacFarlane knows him -- for
MacFarlane he was to Knox as you
are to him. That brought him close
to Gray, he roistered with him and
drank with him. Aye, and Gray even
brought him to my door and my love.
There is all that between them and
more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --

FETTES
But that's long since.  Gray can't
threaten him with that.

MEG
Gray has no need to threaten. You
remember the trial?

FETTES
I heard my parents speak of it in
Thrums. It was a famous case.

MEG
And did you hear them speak of the
porter who testified against Burke?

FETTES
Aye.

MEG
They did not tell you how that
porter cried out in the witness box
when the Kings Counselor pressed
him hard -- how he cried out that
he was shielding a gentleman of
consequence. 

Fettes shakes his head.

MEG (CONT'D)
That porter was Gray and the
gentleman of consequence who
couldn't swallow the shame of
it -- who took my last paltry
savings to hire Gray --

FETTES
MacFarlane

They stand for a moment looking at each other then she turns
wildly toward Fettes and seizes his coat lapels.

MEG
Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one
part befuddled with drink, one part
over-heels in love with MacFarlane,
and one part fey. You're a
lowlander, Fettes, and you have no
way of knowing what we Highlanders
call the second sight.

FETTES
I've heard of it.

MEG
It's a gift to my people -- and I
see MacFarlane and Gray-- the pit
yawns for them and the flames --
and I would have you away from them
and safe out of the torment.--

The two stand facing each other, Meg crushing the boy's coat
lapels in her hands.

DISSOLVE

_*INT. GRAY'S LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT*_

It is very dark as Gray opens the door. For a moment his
distinctive silhouette is in the doorway. Then he closes the
door behind him and the room is again plunged into darkness
except for a glow from the embers in the hearth. Gray crosses
to the hearth. He takes a spill from the mantle, blows on the
coals and lights the spill. Its flaring light reveals
MacFarlane standing watching him. After a first momentary
check of surprise, Gray, without a word, transfers the flame
from the spill to a candle.  He blows out the spill and sets
it back on the mantle.                                                                                           

MED. SHOT with Gray in the f.g. and MacFarlane coming toward
him. Gray has recovered his composure.

GRAY
(very softly)
This is unexpected, Toddy.

MacFarlane comes to a halt facing Gray. The CAMERA BEGINS TO
CHEAT IN ON the pair.

MACFARLANE
(toneless)
I wanted to see you. You weren't
here -- so I waited.

The two men survey each other in absolute silence. From o.s.
near at hand, the cat mews.

The CAMERA PULLS BACK TO SLIGHTLY WIDER ANGLE as Gray turns
away, seating himself upon the arm of a chair. The cat comes
into the shot and jumps up beside him.

MACFARLANE.
(drawing closer)
What do you want of me. Gray?

GRAY
(smiling)
Want of you, Toddy? I want nothing
of you.

TWO SHOT - Gray and MacFarlane.  MacFarlane is tense,
motionless. He stares down at Gray who sits at his ease
stroking the cat, now purring on his knee.

MacFarlane makes an obvious effort to control himself, to
speak calmly.

MACFARLANE
Gray, I must rid myself of you --
you've become a cancer -- a
malignant, evil cancer -- rotting
my mind.

GRAY
(pouring a drink
for MacFarlane)
So, Toddy, you've made me a
disease, eh?

MACFARLANE
(disregarding this
sarcasm, but taking the
proffered glass)
I can't understand your hurt to
me -- but I must cut you out.

He drinks, sets down the glass. Gray watches him, gets up
from his chair and stands before him.

MACFARLANE (CONT'D)
I will not leave here until I have
finished with you. Gray. One way or
another -- I must be sure that I am
rid of you. 

He pauses and looks at Gray.

MACFARLANE (CONT'D)
And if there is no other way --

Gray looks at MacFarlane, big and bulky in the small chair.
He moves nervously.

GRAY
Surely you are not threatening an
old friend, Toddy.

MACFARLANE
We have never been friends.

Gray moves over to the chair on which he sat when he "Burked"
Joseph. He bends forward over the taboret and refills the
doctor's glass.

GRAY
Have another glass of something
good, Toddy.

MACFARLANE
I've drunk enough tonight.

GRAY
(putting the glass down on
the taboret)
Another little drop'll never do you
any harm. 

Almost as if unconscious of his action, MacFarlane picks up
the glass, sips, then drinks. Gray smiles. MacFarlane sets
down the glass. Gray immediately refills it. And again
MacFarlane reaches for it, takes it into his hand.

GRAY (CONT'D)
(softly)
Drink --

MacFarlane, without thought, brings the glass to his lips.

MACFARLANE
You're getting old, Gray, and it's
a hard life driving a cab through
these wet and windy streets of
Edinburgh --

GRAY
I have other means of sustenance.

MACFARLANE
The Resurrection business? That may
end sooner than you think. New laws
may come.

Gray shrugs.

MACFARLANE (CONT'D)
What I was going to say is this --
wouldn't you be more comfortable at
Leith in a neat little house?

GRAY
Would you bribe me to leave you be?

MACFARLANE
I would make you rich.

GRAY
It wouldn't be half so much fun for
me. Toddy, as to have you come here
and beg --

MACFARLANE
(cutting in)
Beg -- beg of you! You crawling
graveyard rat!

He chokes off the last speech and glares at Gray. He is
almost trembling with the effort to control himself.

GRAY
Aye -- that is my pleasure.

As he speaks he is refilling MacFarlane's glass.

MACFARLANE
Well then -- I beg you -- I beseech
you --

GRAY
(shaking, his head and
grinning)
But then I wouldn't have the fun of
having you come here and beg again,
Toddy.

They look at each other. MacFarlane bends over in his chair.
Gray hitches himself forward a little on the table, ready,
waiting, then relaxes as MacFarlane begins to speak.

MACFARLANE
But why, Gray? Why?

GRAY
Because it would be a hurt to me to
see you no more, Toddy. You're a
pleasure to me.

MACFARLANE
A pleasure to torment me?

GRAY
No -- a pride to know that I can
force you to my will. I'm a small
man -- a humble man -- and being
poor, I've had to do much that I
did not want to do. But so long as
the great Dr. MacFarlane jumps at
my whistle, that long am I a man --
and if I have not that, I have
nothing. Then I am only a cabman
and a grave-robber.

MacFarlane looks at him.  As he looks, he realizes he has
heard the truth and that Gray will never leave him in peace. 
Now he, in turn, attempts cunning.  He moves forward in his
chair as if wishing to put forth a convincing argument. 
MacFarlane starts to rise; his mind made up. Gray sees there
is no longer any hope of forestalling violence. He throws
himself forward and seizes him as he seized Joseph. 

MED. FULL SHOT - MacFarlane and Gray. As MacFarlane rises
Gray clings to him and gets his other arm about MacFarlane's
neck. MacFarlane tries to shake him off; tries to twist away
from him. The effort makes him lose his footing.  They fall
together. 

CLOSE SHOT - MacFarlane and Gray on the floor near the
hearth.  Gray still clings to him, every muscle tense.
MacFarlane, with his hands under Gray's shoulders, heaves up
trying to push the man off. He heaves once, twice, a third
time and then lets his arms relax from the futile, enormous
effort. 

TWO HEAD CLOSEUP - Gray and MacFarlane.

GRAY (CONT'D)
Let be, Toddy.  Let be. I have no
wish to hurt you.

MacFarlane's eyes grow huge and fierce with anger. Now he
tries to pummel Gray in order to free himself; raining blows
on his back, his head and into his side, Gray grunts with
each punishing blow, but never for a moment relaxes his grip.
Finally the piston-like blows grow weaker, the flailing arms
fail and MacFarlane drops his hands to the floor at his side,
limp and relaxed. 

MED. CLOSE SHOT -- MacFarlane and Gray as MacFarlane, with
great effort, throws his body to the left, toward the
fireplace.  The boiling kettle is upset and the steaming
water thrown on both of them. 

CLOSE SHOT -- MacFarlane in agony as the water spurts over
him. 

CLOSE SHOT -- Gray. His face is twisted in torment and steam
rises from his scalded flesh.

GRAY (CONT'D)
Stay, Toddy -- don't force me to
kill you -- I have need of you --
the great need of my pride.

TWO SHOT -- Gray and MacFarlane.  MacFarlane's arms again
relax.  Gray smiles through the pain of his scalding.

GRAY (CONT'D)
That's better Toddy. That's more
reasonable,

He lets go his grip on MacFarlane's face.  No sooner has he
done so than MacFarlane throws him off with a violent
movement. Both men scramble to their feet and face each
other.

THE CAMERA SWINGS AWAY FROM the two men and FOCUSES ON the
wall above a lowboy on which the white cat is sitting. The
cat's great, round eyes seem to be surveying the struggle
while above its head the shadows of the two men can be seen
meeting, struggling, breaking off, rushing together again,
and all the while there can be heard the sound of blows,
hoarse breathing, gasps and hard ejaculations of breath. Then
one indistinguishable figure picks up a chair. The chair
breaks with a crash over the head of the other figure and
that figure falls out of scene. Only one upright shadow
remains above the head of the cat. That shadow picks up a
cloak and top hat, puts them on and bends to pick up a body.
The shadow of one man carrying the body of the other comes
toward the cat, the shadow growing huge and out-figure on the
wall. The cat's fur bristles. It arches its back and snarls.

DISSOLVE

_*INT. ANATOMY SCHOOL - NIGHT*_

Only the night light is burning over the door at the entry
way. The school is lit by its swinging light.
Out in the street can be heard the familiar clop-clop of
Gray's horse and the ringing of the iron wheels on the
roadway. 

The CAMERA on DOLLY TRACK MOVES SLOWLY TOWARD the entry door.
The outer door can be heard opening. There is rustle and
noise in the dark entryway. By this time the CAMERA is
CLOSEUP on the door as MacFarlane with a canvas-wrapped
bundle on his shoulder comes through the doorway, and goes to
a FULL CLOSEUP of his face. He starts forward. 

MED. FULL SHOT - MacFarlane as he throws the body down onto
the table. He stands there for a moment looking down at it,
then the noise of a door opening on the stair landing causes
him to turn and look up.

MED. FULL SHOT - the stairway.  Meg is seen at the head of
the stairs, looking down. 

ANOTHER ANGLE - MacFarlane is seen from Meg's viewpoint.

MACFARLANE
Where is Fettes?

MED. FULL SHOT - the stairway as Meg begins to descend.

MEG
He's gone. I sent him away. I'll
not see another boy harried
and torn and made miserable like
you, Toddy. 

MacFarlane looks at her as she descends the stairs. There is
silence as she crosses the room. She comes to stand beside
the table.

MEG (CONT'D)
(pointing to the bundle)
You've been with Gray again.

MACFARLANE
Aye.

Meg turns away as if to start for the stairs.  He stops her.

MACFARLANE (CONT'D)
You'd better look at the face. 

She looks at him.

MACFARLANE (CONT'D)
You'd, better.

Meg resolutely walks up to the table, lifts the canvas and
looks down at the face.

MACFARLANE (CONT'D)
I'm rid of him forever. 

Meg looks at him.

MACFARLANE (CONT'D)
He'll not come here again --
sneaking and whining and bullying. 

Meg is still silent.

MACFARLANE (CONT'D)
Now he'll serve a good purpose --
and tomorrow when the last bit of
him is dissected, demonstrated and
detailed in the students'
notebooks, then at last there's an
end to him.

Meg still looks at him silently and thoughtfully, then with a
slight shake of her head she starts away.

MACFARLANE (CONT'D)
(rubbing his hands
together)
Next day I'll take his horse and
cab to sell at the Pennycuick fair.
(pauses; then makes an
expansive movement with
his hands)
Then not a trace left -- rid of him
forever.

At the foot of the stairs, Meg turns to him.

MEG
You're not rid of him.

FADE OUT

FADE IN

_*EXT. THE RAMPARTS -- DAY*_

A little boy rolling a hoop goes past the camera. Behind him
come running a little convoy of children, laughing and
shouting. When they have passed the camera, Fettes enters the
scene. He is dejected. His hands are in his pockets and his
head is down as he walks toward Georgina and her mother.
Georgina is in her wheelchair. Her head is turned as she
watches the children run out of sight.

FETTES
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.

MRS. MARSH
Good morning, Mr. Fettes.

GEORGINA
I thought this was a school day.

FETTES
I am not at the school anymore.
I left last night.

Mrs. Marsh looks at him.

MRS. MARSH
Left Dr. MacFarlane?

Fettes nods. Mrs. Marsh looks at him and then takes his
elbow.

MRS. MARSH (CONT'D)
(to Georgina)
Play by yourself a little. I'd
like' to speak to Mr. Fettes.

DOLLY SHOT - as Fettes and Mrs. Marsh walk slowly away from
Georgina.

MRS. HARSH
This is serious, Donald. What has
happened?

Fettes shakes his head.

MRS. MARSH
It's not because of Georgina --
because of Dr. MacFarlane's
failure?

FETTES
It's not the failure. I feel that
MacFarlane has taught me nothing.
He taught me the mathematics of
anatomy but he couldn't teach me
the poetry of medicine.

MED. FULL SHOT -- Georgina. She is playing with her doll.
Suddenly, from far below her she hears the clop-clop of a
horse's hoofs and the rumble of iron wheels. She looks up and
listens. 

MED. FULL SHOT - Fettes and Mrs. Marsh.

FETTES (CONT'D)
That's why I don't want to go on. I
feel MacFarlane had me on the wrong
road --a road that led to knowledge
but not to healing. If there had
been any healing in the man,
Georgina would be walking now.

SHOT - Georgina. She is listening intently. The hoof beats
are right underneath her at the base of the castle wall. She
tries to look over the parapet; cannot. She calls out.

GEORGINA
Mommie! Mommie!

FULL SHOT - Mrs. Marsh and Fettes. They are talking intently
together. Mrs. Marsh is holding her parasol in such a way
that it is between her and Georgina.  Georgina's call comes
very faintly over their conversation. Neither of then turns
toward the child.           

MRS. MARSH
I think it was the pain of the
operation more than anything else --
she's afraid that if she stands the
pain will come again. Nothing Dr.
MacFarlane could ever do would take
that out of her mind. 

CLOSE SHOT - Georgina. The hoof beats are beginning to
recede. There is a slight wind blowing. She turns around to
look at her mother and calls again.

GEORGINA
Mommie!  Mommie!

There is no answer. She turns her head back toward the
battlements; tries to peer over them and fails. Then, placing
a hand on each arm of her little chair, she lifts herself to
a sort of standing-sitting position. She tries to look over
the wall again. Again she fails. She turns to call to her
mother.

GEORGINA (CONT'D)
Mommie -- the white horse --
I'm sure it's the white horse -- 

MED. CLOSE SHOT - Fettes and Mrs. Marsh.

FETTES
Even so, I could never think of
going on -- I've got to find some
other profession.

MRS. MARSH
It is a pity.

SHOT - Georgina. She has gotten herself to the same semi
erect position she had been before and now in her desperate
effort to see over the battlement, she suddenly straightens
her knees; her hands lift off the arms of the chair. Without
knowing it, she is standing. She tries again to look over the
wall and again the height and distance is too much for her.
Completely unconscious of what she is doing, she takes a
forward step and from this vantage point she can look over
the wall. She turns back with disappointment on her face. She
calls to her mother.

GEORGINA
Mommie! It was another horse.

CLOSE FULL SHOT -- Fettes and Mrs. Marsh with the child in
the b.g. They see the child standing. Mrs. Marsh makes a
wordless exclamation of joy.  She doesn't even dare to move
for fear this might be a vision. 

ANOTHER ANGLE -- Fettes, Mrs. Harsh and Georgina. Mrs. Marsh
and Fettes run in. CLOSE FULL SHOT-- of the three.

FETTES
You're standing, Georgina.

The child looks down, sees that she is standing and almost
instantly grabs at the chair for support.  Very gently Fettes
pulls it away.

FETTES (CONT'D)
You'll not need that again,
Georgina.

GEORGINA
(excited and almost in
tears)
I wanted to see the white horse --

Fettes and Mrs. Marsh kneel down close to the child. Mrs.
Marsh takes her into her arms. Fettes rises to his feet, his
face is full of enthusiasm and excitement. His voice trembles
with the keenness of accomplishment.

FETTES
(wildly excited)
I've got to tell Dr. MacFarlane.
I've got to tell him.

DISSOLVE

_*INT. MACFARLANE'S HALLWAY -- DAY*_

There is the ringing of a doorbell. Meg comes down the
stairs.  She crosses the hall and opens the door. Fettes
stands there. Meg holds the door open for him to enter and
closes it behind him.

FETTES
Mistress Cameron -- you'll not
believe it, but the child has
walked -- stood and walked. I must
tell Dr. MacFarlane.

He starts forward as if to go on into the study. Meg stops
him with her hand on his arm.

MEG
He's not home.

FETTES
Where can I find him?

MEG
You don't went to find him. Your
news will keep until I tell him.

FETTES
But I must tell him -- he must know
of it. Please -- tell me where he
is.

MEG
There's no standing between a fool
and his folly. If you must babble
your news to him he's at the
Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at
Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's
horse and gig to get there. He'll
welcome the ride back.

FETTES
(already starting to turn;
still very much excited)
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I
can be there in an hour.

MEG
(bitterly)
And back with MacFarlane and all
that he stands for the next day.

She opens the door for Fettes and closes it after him.

DISSOLVE OUT

DISSOLVE IN

_*INT. INN OF THE FISHERMAN'S TRYST -- NIGHT*_

It is a long, low-raftered room with a fire of logs burning
on the hearth. Outside the wind can be heard blowing and
shrilling.  A considerable company has gathered for warmth
and food. 

MED. CLOSE SHOT -- an amiable rustic, a horse dealer, who
stands, booted with whip in hand, talking to several fellow
bumpkins while the maidservant of the inn serves them ale
from a large wooden tray. Their wet clothes are steaming from
the heat of the fire.

HORSE DEALER
A sound horse and a closed carriage
-- and after I'd talked with him a
bit I had his price down to four
pounds and then. 

He laughs.

HORSE DEALER (CONT'D)
And worth every bit or ten pounds.

He lifts a tankard from the tray.

MAIDSERVANT
Surely, Angus, a man who had won so
great a victory in a horse deal
would buy the poor loser a drink.

HORSE DEALER
(taking it big as he
throws a coin onto the
tray)
Take him a pot of ale.

MAIDSERVANT
Ale for a Gentleman? It's only
French brandy he'd be drinking, and
that will be two more shillings,
Angus.

Very reluctantly Angus takes out the additional money. The
girl starts out of scene and the CAMERA PANS WITH her to show
MacFarlane seated at a small table at the other side of the
hearth.  He has just finished dinner and is pushing his plate
away from him.  The maidservant comes up to him.

MAIDSERVANT (CONT'D)
The man who bought your horse
would like you to have a glass
of French brandy at his charge.

MACFARLANE
Now that's very civil of him.

At the other side of the hearth the louts around the horse
dealer strike up a song.  Outside there is the sound of a
horse clattering into the courtyard, then the muffled shouts
as the driver reins the horse in and the hostler goes to his
head.  Both MacFarlane and the maidservant listen and look
toward the door.  The door swings open and Fettes stands
there, his clothes drenched with rain.  As he enters, he
shakes the water from his hat.  He sees MacFarlane and goes
over to him quickly, excited and smiling.

FETTES
Doctor -- the little Marsh girl
stood and walked -- really stood
and walked --

MacFarlane makes way for Fettes on the settle -- Fettes sits
down quickly.

MACFARLANE
What's that you say?

FETTES
The little girl -- she couldn't
walk far -- the muscles are too
weak -- but she did stand and she
took a step or two.

MACFARLANE
(very excited)
I know it -- I know it -- The
moment I was rid of him --

FETTES
What?

MACFARLANE
Gray -- I'm rid of him -- 

Fettes looks at him, puzzled.

MACFARLANE (CONT'D)
(guarding his thoughts)
Just that -- just that -- I've
managed to get him to leave
Edinburgh -- he'll bother me no
more.

He rubs his hands together.

The maidservant has returned with a bottle of brandy and two
glasses. MacFarlane pours one for himself and Fettes.

MACFARLANE (CONT'D)
Drink.

Fettes picks up his glass.

MACFARLANE (CONT'D)
Here's to a good riddance. 

They both drink.

MACFARLANE (CONT'D)
Now that he's gone I'll be a new
man, Fettes, and a better teacher.
The doctors from my school will
perform miracles --

The door opens and a party of five people dressed in rough
mourning come in out of the weather. The maidservant, with a
show of solicitude, ushers them to a table at the far end of
the inn, then crosses quickly to where the horse dealer is.

MAIDSERVANT
Sh-h-h! Still your song, lads --
the MacCreadys are here and they've
come from burying the old woman in
Glencorse Kirkyard.

They stop singing and look over with sympathetic glances at
the burial party. 

MED. CLOSE SHOT - Fettes and MacFarlane.  MacFarlane looks
from the boys around the fire to the burial party.

MACFARLANE
See that, Fettes?

FETTES
A burial party -- poor people --
it's hard to bury a loved one on a
rainy day when the churchyard is so
cold and lonely.

MACFARLANE
Glencorse -- that's a lonely
cemetery, Fettes, not a soul
around for miles.

FETTES
They'll be thinking of that, too.

MACFARLANE
Tosh!  Fettes!  It's not their
grief I'm worrying about -- I'm
talking of our own end --

FETTES
You've no thought of going there?

MACFARLANE
Did you think Gray was the only one
who could handle a mattock and
shovel?  I've had some practice in
the art.

FETTES
(protesting)
You couldn't do that, Doctor.

MACFARLANE
(rising)
I pass up no opportunities, I've a
whole course of lectures in mind
for you fellows.  We'll need
subjects to demonstrate. Come
along.

FETTES
No.

MACFARLANE
Why not? I must have subjects. It's
the only way I can teach. It's the
only way you can learn. The
stupidity of the people the idiocy
of their laws will not stop no --
nor will they force me to deal with
such reptilian creatures as Gray.
We can do our own dirty work -- and
we must.

Fettes shakes his head. MacFarlane starts for the door and
after a little pause, Fettes rises and follows him.

DISSOLVE

_*EXT. COUNTRY GRAVEYARD - NIGHT*_

FULL SHOT. The thunder increases in volume throughout the
scene.  In extreme b.g. two figures can be seen
intermittently.

CLOSE SHOT - grave. The headstone is brand new but the mound
beneath it has been demolished, leaving a ragged gaping hole. 
A spade comes down into picture with vicious force.  As it is
raised with its burden of earth:

MACFARLANE'S VOICE
(triumphant)
So we can't do without Mister Gray 
- So I'd never be rid of him, eh? 

CLOSE SHOT - MacFarlane and Fettes as they work over the
grave. MacFarlane's spade thumps against wood.

MACFARLANE
A-ah!

He jumps down into the grave, the CAMERA TILTING DOWN CUTTING
OUT Fettes.  MacFarlane is levering up the edge of the coffin
with his spade.  As the wood gives, there is a tremendous
clap of thunder immediately overhead, followed by a solid
deluge of rain.

_*EXT. ROAD - NEAR CEMETERY - NIGHT*_

MED. FULL SHOT. The storm is raging. In the f.g. is
MacFarlane's carriage, the horse tethered to the fence.
Whickering, intensely nervous, he is looking o.s. toward the
cemetery. Shuffling footsteps come over shot and the horse's
fear increases. 

MED. SHOT - at side of carriage is MacFarlane and Fettes come
into scene carrying a heavy burden, wrapped in canvas.

FETTES
(hoarsely)
Where shall we put it? In the back?

MACFARLANE
No room there. We'll have to set it
between us.

QUICK DISSOLVE

_*EXT. HILLSIDE ROAD - NIGHT*_

FULL SHOT - The storm is continuing unabated. A narrow,
twisting road runs down the hillside, and the terrain is
desolate and rocky. Horse's hooves are heard and MacFarlane's
carriage comes into the scene, going down the hill.

_*INT. CARRIAGE -- NIGHT -- (PROCESS)*_

CLOSE SHOT - MacFarlane. He is driving, his head thrust
forward to see the road. The CAMERA PANS, VERY SLIGHTLY to
show what is next to him; something wrapped in a thin sheet
of canvas; something which sits limply; something which shows
the unmistakable shape of a human body beneath its covering.
It is held by Fettes' hand which is just in shot. The CAMERA
PANS again to show Fettes. His teeth are clenched; his eyes
closed. 

MED. SHOT - showing both men and the thing between them. The
horse is trotting fast and as the carriage turns a bend, the
thing lunges heavily against MacFarlane's shoulder.

MACFARLANE
(savagely)
Keep it off me, will you!

_*EXT. HILLSIDE ROAD - NIGHT*_

FULL SHOT - Still the storm - even fiercer. MacFarlane's
carriage, the horse galloping, comes down the hill, swaying
and lurching. The pace is much too fast for the going.

_*INT. CARRIAGE - NIGHT - (PROCESS)*_

MED. SHOT. It is very dark. MacFarlane is hauling at the
reins with all his strength.

MACFARLANE
(savage)
What's got into this animal! 

CLOSE SHOT - Fettes. He is still holding the thing o.s. 

THREE SHOT. The carriage sways violently and the thing
between the men, its outlines barely distinguishable, seems
to twist out of Fettes' grip. It sags against MacFarlane.

MACFARLANE (CONT'D)
Keep it off me!

Forced to keep both hands on the reins, MacFarlane tries to
thrust the thing away with his shoulder. But it still keeps
falling against him.

MACFARLANE (CONT'D)
(shouting)
Keep it off me, I say!

Fettes makes an effort to hold on to the corpse.

MED. FULL SHOT -- the carriage going along the road; the
horse proceeding at a hard trot. The hoof beats ring out
rhythmically. 

THREE SHOT -- PROCESS -- Fettes, MacFarlane and the corpse.
The rhythmic hoof beats sound very loud as the two men drive
on in silence. Fettes makes a desperate effort to hold the
corpse away from MacFarlane, but it keeps bumping into the
doctor.  Through the hoof beats and in the same rhythm comes
the voice of Gray on the sound track.

GRAY'S VOICE
You'll not get rid of me that way --
that way -- that way -- that way --

MacFarlane shakes his head as if to clear it of this
remembered voice;  these well-remembered words. 

CLOSE SHOT -- MacFarlane.  His eyes are wide with
apprehension and fear.  He glances down at the wrapped corpse
as it bumps against him. He draws away, shivering. Over the
sound track Gray's voice still sounds beating on the ear with
the same rhythm as the hoofs on the road.  MacFarlane pulls
up on the reins. 

THREE SHOT - as MacFarlane turns to Fettes the carriage comes
to a halt.

MACFARLANE
(making an effort to
arrive at speech)
Fettes -- for Mercy's sake, let's
have a light!

Fettes looks over at his companion. He has never seen
MacFarlane in this state before and the younger man is
puzzled.

FETTES
All right.

He climbs over the sill into the roadway. 

MED. FULL SHOT - the carriage as Fettes tries to strike a
light in the pouring rain and howling wind. He finally gets a
taper going and touches it to the lamp wick. The lamp flares
for a moment. 

TWO SHOT -- MacFarlane and the corpse.

MACFARLANE
It's changed!  I swear it!
It's changed, Fettes!

REVERSE SHOT - Fettes as he looks up puzzled.

FETTES
Changed? Changed, to what?

HIGH ANGLE SHOT - MacFarlane and the corpse with Fettes at a
lower level.

MACFARLANE
Let's have that lamp.

Fettes undoes it from the dashboard and lifts it up over his
head to cast a light on the corpse.

MACFARLANE (CONT'D)
(looking down at the
bundle)
This is not a woman!

FETTES
(matter-of-factly)
It was a woman when we put her in.

MACFARLANE
(somewhat wildly)
Hold that lamp up -- I must see her
face. 

He tears open the sacking.

ANOTHER ANGLE - CLOSE SHOT of Fettes.  He is looking up
holding the lantern high over his head, but is unable to see
anything over the high dashboard except MacFarlane's face. 
Suddenly, MacFarlane pulls back and on his face there is such
a look of anguish and terror that Fettes cries out in alarm.

FETTES
Dr. MacFarlane?

REVERSE SHOT - Now the face of the dead woman can be seen
with MacFarlane looking down at it in horror as slowly it
turns to the dark, well-moulded features and smooth-shaven
cheeks of the familiar countenance of Gray. A wild yell
breaks from MacFarlane's lips.

MACFARLANE
Gray -- Gray --

MED. FULL SHOT - the horse and carriage. The nervous horse
bolts. Fettes tries to dodge out of the way. The lamp falls
and breaks and in the darkness the carriage goes bounding
past his and away. He stands looking after it, then breaks
into a run, following the runaway.

CLOSE SHOT - MacFarlane.  He is fighting to control the
horse.  But, as the carriage rocks, the thing against his
shoulder moves; either by reason of the violent motion or of
some frightful volition of its own. 

The canvas wrapping slips, slides away and reveals again the
head and naked torso of Gray. 

The pace increases even more. MacFarlane sees the dreadful
metamorphosis and a strangled cry breaks from his throat. 

The carriage sways again and the arms come free from the
canvas. Another swerve, another lurch and they have fallen
limply around MacFarlane's neck.

_*EXT. HILLSIDE ROAD - NIGHT*_

FULL SHOT - a hairpin turn, with cliff-wall to one side, a
sheer drop to the other. The carriage, the horse beyond
control, cannot take it at the speed. It strikes the cliff, a
wheel breaks loose, the braces tear apart, the horse
staggers, runs on free, the carriage tilts sickeningly,
stands on end, rolls over the edge and plunges down to
destruction.

_*EXT. HILLSIDE ROAD - NIGHT*_

Fettes has managed to get the lamp going again and is running
along the road, following the wheel tracks in the rain-soaked
earth. He comes upon a bit of wreckage and stops. He listens,
then walks over to the edge of the cliff. He holds his
lantern well over the edge and peers down. Then he starts
down the cliff side.

_*EXT. THE CLIFF SIDE - NIGHT*_

MED. FULL SHOT - Fettes as he scrambles down, holding the
lantern at arm's length to protect it from the rough rocks
and the heather.  He comes to a slightly more level space and
stops. He looks down. 

MED. SHOT - SHOOTING DOWNWARD FROM Fettes' viewpoint.
MacFarlane's body, obviously without life, is lying flat on
its back, arms and legs outspread. And, lying against his
chest, is something wrapped in canvas.
The CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY DOWN UNTIL IT IS CLOSE, showing
beyond all doubt that not only has the canvas never been
disturbed, but also that it is the woman's body which it
covers.

FADE OUT

_*THE END*_

"BEDLAM"

AN RKO RADIO PICTURE

Final Script

June 30, 1945

CHAMBER OF HORROR

A TALE OF BEDLAM

BEHIND the MAIN and CREDIT TITLES appear a series of Hogarth
paintings; one painting to each card. The painting which
shows the "Industrious Apprentice" in church will be used to
frame the MAIN TITLE. More elaborate and multicharactered
paintings will be used until the final painting is "Bedlam."
It is over this last painting that the narrative title
appears.
LONDON - 1761
The people of the Eighteenth Century
called their Period "The Age of Reason"

As this TITLE FADES, the MUSIC of the overture FADES WITH it
and there can be heard the SOUND of shrieks, wild laughter
and hysterical babbling.

EXT. ST. MARY'S OF BETHLEHEM HOSPITAL - NIGHT - SPECIAL
EFFECTS

LOW CAMERA SETUP to show the face of the building between the
two statues of "Madness" and "Melancholia" above the gates.
The CAMERA TILTS to show the upper stories. As it reaches the
cornice of the building, a man in dark small-clothes and a
white shirt, can be seen clinging to the gutter four stories
above the street. He has the fingers of one hand hooked over
the gutter and is wildly scrambling to get a grip with the
other hand. 

CLOSE SHOT - the man, dangling from the roof, desperately
struggling.

EXT. THE ROOF GUTTER - ST. MARY'S OF BETHLEHEM - NIGHT

A man with a lighted lantern in his hand, wearing great broad
toed shoes, comes clumping along the gutter. He holds up the
lantern to look for a moment at the struggling man.

ANOTHER ANGLE - the CAMERA SHOOTING down OVER the

shoulders of the man with the lantern. For a brief moment,
the lantern light illuminates the white, desperate face of
the clinging man. Then the man with the lantern grinds the
other man's hand under his heavy heel. The man in the white
shirt falls, screaming.

EXT. ST. MARY'S OF BETHLEHEM HOSPITAL - NIGHT

The falling figure, as the man drops with a long, sustained
shriek of desperation. The body crumples sickeningly on the
sidewalk. People run in from either side. The door opens and
a warder clatters down the steps.

The CAMERA TILTS again and goes up past the doorway to focus
on the lintel between the statues so that the inscription
thereon can be read.

ST. MARY'S OF BETHLEHEM HOSPITAL 

Asylum For The Insane

EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT

LONG SHOT. A closed carriage comes careening down the street,
its lamps glowing, and the coachman and footman sitting
austerely on the box.

INT. LORD MORTIMER'S CARRIAGE - NIGHT - PROCESS

Lord Mortimer and Nell Bowen. Lord Mortimer is a blandly
stout man, puffy as a Yorkshire pudding, with a belly that
would do honor to Silenus.  He is of merry, but stupid,
countenance and even in an age of rococo ostentation, his
costume is outstandingly luxuriant. Actually, he is not a bad
sort; only a little too rich and too foolish for his
country's good.

Like Lord Mortimer, his companion, Nell Bowen, is a product
of her age; a beautiful girl, bold as a frigate, merry as a
flag and with no more thought for right and wrong, or the
problems of the future, than the parrot on her wrist. She
would rather say a bright word than do a good deed. At the
moment, she is amusing herself with her parrot. Lord
Mortimer, between sniffs of snuff and the accompanying
explosive sneeze, is rolling with laughter, his fat belly
shaking. He stops long enough for Nell to coax her parrot to
display its prowess.

NELL
(to the parrot)
Come, Poll, do you know my friend,
Lord Mortimer?
(prompting) )
Lord Mortimer  Lord Mortimer 

The parrot finally deigns to let out a raucous yell.

PARROT
Lord Mortimer is like a pig. His
brain's small and his belly big.

Lord Mortimer is seized with paroxysms of laughter. He hugs
Nell with familiarity in the abandon of his mirth.

EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT

MED. LONG SHOT - the coach. A few people running across the
street are in danger of being run down. The coachman slows
his team. A huckster, pushing his barrow before him,
hastening to see the cause of the excitement, brings the
carriage of Lord Mortimer to a complete halt.

EXT. THE COACH - NIGHT

MED. SHOT. Lord Mortimer is leaning forward to see what is
going on. The footman starts to climb down.

INT. THE COACH - NIGHT

SHOOTING OUT PAST Nell Bowen and Lord Mortimer. The footman's
head appears at the window.

MILORD
What's this hub-bub?

FOOTMAN
One of the lunatics from the
asylum, I expect, Milord.

NELL
(excitedly)
A prank? A jest?

MILORD 
Go and see, John.

The footman turns and leaves and can be seen pushing his way
through the crowd.

NELL
(looking out and up)
Bedlam --? It doesn't look so merry
a place, Milord. . .

MILORD 
Never been there?

Nell, still looking, shakes her head.

MILORD
You'll have to pay Master Sims
tupence to see the loonies in their
cages  maybe they can teach you
some new tricks, Nell.

NELL
I've no need of their wit to
entertain you, Milord.

Lord Mortimer tries to get the kernel of the thought between
his mental teeth. Before he can get it, John, the footman,
comes back through the crowd.

JOHN
They say, sir, that one of the poor
devils in there fell from the roof,
trying to escape.

MILORD 
(without any feeling)
Very regrettable  well, drive on.

JOHN
(a little excitedly) 
Your Lordship  it seems to me the
man was known to you.

MILORD
Eh?

JOHN
I thought I saw him in your company
not a week gone by.

MILORD
Eh  really?

He shifts himself ponderously forward on the cushioned seat.

MILORD
Well, let's have a look.

John holds the door open for him and he starts to get out.

CLOSE SHOT - the step of the carriage as Lord Mortimer's
satin-slippered foot is placed upon it. The step sags down
and the carriage groans with his weight.

MED. LONG SHOT - the crowd, SHOOTING PAST the rear wheels of
the coach. Lord Mortimer, proceeded by the footman, makes his
way through the crowd.

ANOTHER ANGLE. On the pavement, in a disjointed fashion, the
body of the man in the white shirt lies sprawling. Lord
Mortimer bends over him.

JOHN
(gesturing) 
You  with the light 

The link boy advances his torch.

LOW CAMERA SETUP.    The torch light illuminates a close view
of Lord Mortimer's face.   '

MILORD
(quietly and without change of
expression) 
It is  it is young Master Colby.

MED. FULL SHOT. Lord Mortimer turns to a man in a leather
apron whose official capacity as a guard is demonstrated by
the keys hung at his hip.

WARDER
He fell trying to escape. Some of
our boobies haven't sense enough to
keep safe behind their bars.

MILORD
Where is Sims? 

The man shrugs.

MILORD
Fetch him.

WARDER
He is dining out, Milord.

MILORD 
(angrily)
Dining out with Colby's blood on
his hands! Do you know me?

WARDER
(knuckling his forehead)
Yes, Milord,

MILORD
Then tell Master Sims to wait upon
me in the morning. I have some few
words I wish to say to him.

The warder bobs his forelock in deferential agreement. Milord
turns away, striding through the crowd to his carriage.  .

FADE OUT

FADE IN                                                                                                                           

INT. ANTE-CHAMBER OF LORD MORTIMER'S HOME - DAY                          

The sun shines warmly into this little bright-bandbox of a
room to illuminate the brooding figure of a man in a black
coat. He sits with his chin upon the rounded head of his cane
and the seamed wickedness of his heavy face, the thick woolen
stuff of his clothes and even the stiff leather of his shoes,
all make a sad contrast to the shining satin, polished wood
and painted wall paper of this pretty apartment.

This is Master Sims, Apothecary General of the Hospital,          
St. Mary's of Bethlehem, pamphleteer to the Tory party,            
a poetaster and a wit; a type de siecle cut from the                  
same sharp cloth as Boswell, Johnson and Voltaire; men                
of genius who were at the same time scoundrels and toadies.                                                                                                                   

From the next room comes the shout of Nell's parrot and    
the roaring laughter of Lord Mortimer. As Sims sits waiting,
a small procession of servants pass bearing trays of covered
dishes from which small clouds of steam escape. The last is
an elaborately dressed little black-a-moor bearing a small
silver mirror and a patch box. Sims interposes his cane
before the colored boy, bringing him to a halt.                                                                                   

SIMS                                   
Will you remind Lord Mortimer that
I am waiting.

The little black-a-moor gives him one look and passes on
disdainfully.

CLOSE SHOT - Master Sims relaxes again into a waiting
posture. From Lord Mortimer's room comes another shout of
laughter. He looks at the doorway with hatred, then quickly
looks about the room, straightening his face as if afraid
that even this momentary flash of true feeling might have be
on seen.

INT. LORD MORTIMER'S BED CHAMBER - DAY                                                  

Lord Mortimer is still in bed surrounded by billowing                  
cushions, so that the bed and his body are one great mass of
globular curves. Nell Bowen, in a velvet riding habit, her
train over her arm a crop in her hand

and a cocky tricorn on her head, lounges at the foot of the
bed. Beside her on a stand sits her parrot. The servants are
busily setting out Lord Mortimer's breakfast table. The
colored page has presented him with the mirror and is holding
before him. Lord Mortimer selects a patch and looking in the
mirror finds a place for it on his cheek. He pats It into
place, then turns the mirror so that the little, colored boy
can see it.

MILORD
Well, Pompey, are you a pretty boy
this morning?

Pompey looks into the mirror and makes a horrible grimace,
contorting his face into what he conceives to be the very
pink of ugliness.

EXTREMELY CLOSE SHOT - of the mirror with Pompey's grimace
reflected therein.

MED. FULL SHOT - the group.

NELL 
What are you trying to do, Pompey?

POMPEY
(looking up)
Milord, I want to look like the
visitor in the hallway.

MILORD
(almost roaring as he sits
up in bed)
Sims! I'd forgotten Sims!
(to servants)
You there clear out. I want room
for anger.

The servants hurriedly finish putting the last dishes on the
breakfast table and, bowing,  start to take their departure
from the room.

NELL
(calling after them gaily)
Send in the good Sims  first 
course for Milord's rage, to be
eaten with a sauce of Lightning,
and to the tune of thunder - Send
him in  send him in 

INT. ANTE-CHAMBER -  DAY

The servants come in from the inner room.    One of them
starts over toward Sims who lifts his chin expectantly from
his  cane.    Before the servant can speak there is a bellow
from the other room.

MILORD'S VOICE
(shouting)
Sims!

With a smirk the servant gestures toward the door.    Sims,
rising slowly, passes into the other room.    As he goes
through the doorway another bellow can be heard.

MILORD'S  VOICE
Sims!

The door closes behind him.  With one-accord the servants
cluster about the door, one  gluing his eye to the, keyhole, 
another his ear to the panel.  There is a confused hub-bub of
angry SOUNDS.  They grin maliciously. Suddenly, the door
opens and the servants straighten up and try to look as if
they had been engaged upon lawful errands, then relax as
Pompey comes through the door.  He  looks them over coolly,
shuts the door and then takes the key position at the
keyhole.



INT.   LORD MORTIMER'S BED CHAMBER -  DAY

Master Sims is  making an elegant "leg" before his Lordship.    
Lord Mortimer is in  full  spate.

MILORD
--  that you hated him I knew, that
you envied him was known to all,
but that you would dare -- dare to 
leave that murderous window open -- 
to murder him from spite  and envy -

SIMS
Murder, Milord? There was no
murder. Jackson was my guest. 
He decided to leave the window
before I could open the door for
him and then -- that monstrous
accident.

NELL
Accident? Master Sims is writing a
new dictionary.

Both men look at her, completely puzzled.

NELL
Are accidents contrived, plotted,
executed?

Sims looks at her for a moment, appraising and judging his
antagonist, then he smirks.

SIMS
Exactly,   Mistress Bowen.    This
was  a misadventure  contrived by
the  victim and executed by
nature's law that those who lose
their grip on gutters must fall.

MILORD
You stick to that story, Master
Sims?

SIMS
I could never invent one half so
droll. The characters of the tale;
two poets  Colby and myself. But I
am not only a poet, but also, by
your Lordship's favor, the
Apothecary General of St. Mary's of
Bethlehem Hospital. My friend comes
to discuss poetry. I am absent. My
guards mistake my friend for a mad
man. He attempts to escape from
them and is killed -- like a
romance, Milord.

MILORD
It's a romance that cost me twenty
guineas and a night of laughter.

SIMS
How so, Milord?

NELL
(breaking in)
Lord Mortimer was foolish enough to
pay in advance for poetry promised
in the future. Jackson was to write
a masque for the fete Lord Mortimer
is giving.

SIMS
(almost cringing in his servility)
If I could offer my humble talents 
- even at the hospital I deal in
wit and laughter, Madame. Are there
any who have come to Bedlam and say
the entertainment is not worth the
tupence they paid?

NELL
You don't entertain me, Master
Sims.

SIMS 
(grinning)
That is because you have a tender
heart. Most people laugh at my
ugliness.

NELL
(coldly)
It offends me, sir.

SIMS
(with a gracious gesture)
To move a lady so beautiful in any
way --

MILORD
(laughing)
He's gallant, too.

SIMS
I am as you wish, Milord, and I
shall make your fete a frolic you
will remember.'

MILORD
How?

SIMS
Sometimes the success of the play
belongs to the players. What if the
masque were performed by my company
of wits, the Bedlamites?

MILORD
Have your loonies perform?

He begins to laugh at the thought.

MILORD
The opposition --- not John Wilkes
nor his whole Whig Party -- could
think of anything as clever as
that, eh, Nell?

NELL 
You didn't think of it either.

MILORD
Well, it's one and the same thing 

He waves his hand in Sims' general direction.

MILORD
My friend, here, thought of it.

SIMS
Let us say that you inspired the
thought, Milord.

MILORD
(immensely pleased)
You hear that Nell? I inspired him.

Nell looks from Lord Mortimer to Sims and back again. She
says nothing.

SIMS
(trying to draw her into
this community of good
feeling)
Let us say that you both inspired
me  Milord and the beloved of
Milord.

Nell flashes him a quick, hard look.

NELL
I think you misunderstand, Master
Sims. I am Milord's protege. I
entertain him and
he has no more freedom with me than
any other man.

There is a short silence. Both men are embarrassed.

SIMS
I, Milord, will but give me the
day and hour of the fete, I'll
prepare a masque of madness to set
you howling.

MILORD
A week from today at the Vauxhall.
The company assembles at eight.

SIMS
Thank you.
(to Milord)
With your leave --

He indicates the door. Milord waves a fat but graceful hand.
With another bow, Sims backs toward the door. Milord reaches
for the cup of chocolate on the stand and begins to drink
from a tiny china cup; a cup that looks like a thimble in his
pudgy hand. He begins to laugh. Nell looks at him
inquiringly.

MILORD
A merry notion --

NELL
(sarcastically)
The Lord Mayor will roll in the
soup with laughter.

MILORD
A capital fellow this Sims -- a
capital fellow.

NELL
If you ask me,  Milord,  he's a
stench  in the  nostrils,  a  sewer
of ugliness and a gutter brimming
with slop.

MILORD
But witty.

NELL
(with a smile)
So he tells us.

MILORD
Even if his wit is wanting his
Bedlamites will set my guests
roaring.    Everyone who goes  to
Bedlam expires with laughter.
Why don't  you go and see them,
Nell?    You'll see how funny they
are.

NELL
Perhaps I will.



EXT. ST. MARY'S OF BETHLEHEM HOSPITAL - DAY

A  group of three Cockney girls carrying baskets  go past, 
directing their  shouts of "Lavender, sweet lavender" toward 
the houses  across  the  street from the asylum.    A  cart
with a  canvas  tilt passes. In it are a bevy of young women, 
fresh from the  country. They gawk  at  the  grey walls  of
Bedlam,  pointing their fingers and chattering among
themselves.

(See Hogarth's "Harlot's Progress,  Plate #1")    A dandy on
the sidewalk looks at the girls in the slowly moving cart
through his quizzing glass. A scrub woman is  scrubbing the 
steps  to the hospital entrance.

Walking heavily,   letting his weighty cane aid him, Master
Sims  comes down the   street.    At the entrance steps he 
pauses.

MED. CLOSE SHOT -  the charwoman looks up.    Towering above
her  is the lord of this mad-domain.  Hurriedly she  begins
to wipe dry the  step  she had been scrubbing. Sims  stands 
quietly until she has  finished, then, without a word or a
nod, passes  on up -the  stairs. Almost instantly a warder
opens it and respectfully steps aside to let Sims enter,    
Sims passes him without a salutation or without even noticing
the man's hand deferentially at his forelock.

DISSOLVE OUT

DISSOLVE IN

INT. SIMS' OFFICE - DAY

This is a cluttered apartment. Books, manuscripts, bottles,
pipes, canes and other oddments and oddments are scattered
about in a disorderly fashion.  In a corner of the room is a
counting desk, Perched on a high stool is a slim wraith-like
creature of the male sex with an enormous periwig atop a tiny
head so that he looks like a spider with a fleck of wool on
his head. He lays down a quill-pen on his ledger and rises to
greet Sims with a low bow. This worthy clerk is called Guy
Podge.

PODGE
(making a leg)
Good morning, Master Sims.

Sims takes off his hat, throws it to one corner of the room,
removes his scratch wig and lets it fall to the desk top.    

PODGE
There is a Quaker waiting for you,
sir -- a master stone mason. Will
you have him in?

Sims looks around the desk.

SIMS
Podge where is my rhyming lexicon?
I want a rhyme for Mortimer.

PODGE
That Quaker, sir -

SIMS
Whatever are you rattling on about? 
I have an important commission - a
rhymed comedy for Milord Mortimer -
and you bother me with some
snivelling Quaker.

PODGE
(humbly)
He's been waiting so long.

SIMS
Waiting?

PODGE
(with a glance at  the
clock)
Four hours, sir.

SIMS
I waited three hours for Lord
Mortimer before he would give me a
dog's word. Let him wait.

PODGE
He will not wait. He's a good
workman and cheap, I'm told.

SIMS
Cheap?
(thinking a moment)
Let him in.



EXT. HALLWAY - DAY

Podge crosses to the door, leans out and beckons.

INT. SIMS OFFICE -DAY

In comes William Hannay, a young Quaker of about twenty-six,
dressed in the plain, neat habit of his sect. His  hair is
unpowdered and is square cut. He looks both neat and washed,
which is a great deal more than can be said for even the
luxurious person of Lord Mortimer, to say nothing of the
fusty garments and dirty scratch wig of Master Sims. Podge
stands by the door while the Quaker advances and stands
before Sims' desk. Sims, who has returned to his perusal of
the book, does not lift his head. The Quaker stands silently.
Podge makes a nervous SOUND in his throat. Sims pays not the
least bit of attention. There is an awkward silence, then
Sims, very deliberately, closes the book and looks up. 

SIMS
You may leave us, Podge.                                                                            

Podge fusses out the door.

SIMS
My clerk tells me that you will do
the work cheaply.                                                                   

HANNAY                                                  
With cut stone one foot thick and
the best mortar, I could do the
work for fifteen guineas.

SIMS
What if I were to give you eighteen
guineas? 

HANNAY
It would be too much.

SIMS
(as If he had not heard)
Eighteen guineas and you are to
return to me two  then you would I
have a better price and I would I
have some reason to employ you. 

HANNAY 
My friend - I have forgotten what
thee has said. If thee do not
repeat it, then I can believe no
evil of thee.                      

SIMS
What kind of can't is this? I've
asked you for a bribe, man! You've
never been asked before? This is
simple business between us two.

HANNAY
(obviously controlling his
temper)
My friend, about the stone masonry -

At his moment, the door bursts open and Nell Bowen comes
sailing into the room.

Sims reaches hastily for his scratch wig, slaps it on his
head and rises, smiling. Nell is in riding clothes and has a
crop in her hand.

SIMS
I had not looked forward to the
pleasure of seeing you so                  
I soon again, Mistress Bowen.

Nell Bowen, out of the corner of her eye, gives the Quaker an
appraising look, speaking to Sims as she does so.

NELL
I have a curiosity to see the
loonies in their cages.                        

SIMS
And so you shall  and so you
shall.                                   

Sims goes around the desk and offers her his arm with half
bow. She places her gloved hand on his elbow. Hannay steps
aside to let them pass out the door. 

INT. CORRIDOR - ST. MARY'S OF BETHLEHEM - DAY

Sims and Nell come out into the corridor and he guides her
toward the left. Behind them Hannay emerges from the office
and stands waiting.

ANOTHER ANGELS - Nell and Sims walk down the hall.    At the
rack, Sims pauses.

MED. CLOSE SHOT. - Sims and Nell. She looks up at the rack.
There are some gentlemen's hats, two small swords, a bludgeon
and a sheathed dirk on a broad leather belt hanging from this
apparatus. A guard stands beside it, Sims puts out his hand
for Nell's riding whip She looks puzzled and draws away from
him.

SIMS
Your riding crop. Mistress Bowen.
You must hang it here. It's a law
of the institute  no weapons 

NELL
For Heaven's sake, why?

SIMS
In his play, Dekker, a second-rate
dramatist of the last century,
wrote of those in there --

He gestures to the door at the end of the corridor.

SIMS
"Fierce as wild bulls/ untamable as
flys,/ And these have oft/ from
stranger's sides,/ Snatched rapiers
suddenly/ and done much harm."

NELL
Strangely  one forgets you are a
man of letters, Master Sims.

Neil hands him her whip. He hangs it on the rack.

SIMS
Our hospital is ancient and well
known -- much written of - I dare
say, no man or woman comes to
London from the country who does
not pay his tupence.

He puts out his hand, palm up and Nell fumbles for a moment
in a reticule at her waist, brings forth some coins, counts
out two coppers and puts them in his hand. He smiles and
offers her his arm again.

TRUCKING SHOT - The CAMERA on a crane, DOLLIES BEFORE Nell
and Sims as they walk toward the doors at the end of the
corridor; The nearer they get to the door the closer the
CAMERA is to Nell's face so that finally she is in full CLOSE
UP. As she walks down the corridor strange cries, shrieks,
bursts of laughter and hysterical babblings grow louder and
louder, Nell, listening as she walks, grows more intent and
wondering. So long as Sims continues in the frame, he is
watching her reaction to these SOUNDS with cruel amusement.

As the CAMERA BACKS THROUGH the double doors, the doors
opening to either side, Nell's face is in  FULL CLOSE-UP. 
Both she and the CAMERA STOP.

The CAMERA HOLDS just long enough to convey the look of
horror on her countenance, then activated by the crane, the
CAMERA SWOOPS UP and BACK to reveal the SOUND and fury of
Bedlam.

(Note to Director: Please use care with the following
sequences according to conversation regarding the showing of
insane and lunatic persons.)

The main ward of Bedlam from the superior height of the
camera is shown as a strange, unearthly place. Barred windows
set high in the wall push dust-filled beams of sunlight
across the room, leaving the larger portion of the great hall
in shadow,  In these shadows and in the blinding sunlight,
strange, aimless human beings can be dimly seen. At the same
moment that this curious room reveals itself to the eye the
horrid SOUND of Bedlam bursts upon the ear; the moans, the
shrieks, the maniacal laughter and the bird-like twitter of
idiocy. At the far end of the room, Sims leads Nell from the
dark doorway to a blazing square of sunlight.

FULL SHOT - Sims and Nell.  Nell looks about her. What she
sees is one small section of the main hall of Bedlam. Near
the stairway are the open doors of two rooms through which
the mad inmates can be seen.

(This set up should approximate the picture of Bedlam by
Hogarth, with Sims and Nell in the places of the mistress and
the maid, visitors to the institution who can be seen in the
left middle b.g. of the painting.)

MED. CLOSE SHOT - Nell and Sims are seen through the weaving
ribbons in the fumbling hands of an idiot who is amusing
himself at "Cats Cradle."

SIMS
Are they not witty, Mistress Bowen?
Look at the frolic that this one
treats himself to. All day long
weaving nets to catch peacocks for
the Royal dinner.

He forces a laugh,  Nell looks at him.

NELL
(quietly; still shocked by
the first contact with
the insane; almost as if
to herself)
They are all so lonely -- they are
all in themselves and by
themselves. They pay no heed to us.

SIMS
(smiling faintly)
You noticed  that.  They have their
world and we have ours.

NELL
(still speaking almost as
if to herself) )
Like separate dreams.

SIMS
Ours  is a human world, theirs  is
a bestial world -- without reason
and without soul.    They're
animals.

He  takes her arm.

TRUCKING SHOT - Nell and Sims as they approach a pillar that
holds up the roof of the great hall. At a small table butted
against this pillar sits a quiet, decently dressed man,
Oliver Todd, the author, who is busily writing with a quill
pen, Sidney Long, a tall, slim man of early middle age with a
bald head and dressed in breeches and waistcoat leans against
the table. Crouched at the foot of the table is a timorous
young maniac, Dan, whose eyes are wide with countless, unseen
terrors.

SIMS
(as they come up to this group)
Some are dogs, These I beat.

He lifts his hand and Dan, the Dog, crouches away from him in
abject fear,

SIMS
(as they continue to walk)
--and some are pigs.
(he points)

MED. CLOSE SHOT - A dirty man.  This man has matted unkempt
hair and board and crouches down in a mass of soiled rags.

SIMS
--these I let wallow in their own
filth.

They pass on.

TRUCKING SHOT - Sims and Nell.

SIMS
Some are tigers -- their remedy is
a dose of iron -- chains.

He pauses and points.

ANOTHER ANGLE - to show the barred doorway of the room in
which Tom, the Tiger is confined. This is a gigantic maniac. 
The rents of his garments show the muscles of his torso and
arms. He is chained to the wall; one chain binds his right
arm to the wall, another chain passes about his waist and
through  in the wall behind him; other chains hold his legs.
Only his left arm and hand are free and with this hand he is
plucking at the chain which binds his torso.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - Dorothea, a young girl in a grey gown, her
dark hair falling about her shoulders. She stands statue-like
by a pillar, her eyes set in a vision of far away worlds. 
Not a muscle moves in the face of this victim of melancholia.
As Sims and Nell come up to her, Sims stops and with a coarse
hand pats the cheek of the insane girl, the contemptuous sort
of pat one would give a heifer in passing a stall.

SIMS
- and some, like this one are
doves.

Nell looks at him with aversion.

NELL 
I've seen enough.

She turns and starts away.

TRUCKING SHOT - Sims catches up with Nell and lays his hand
on her elbow.

SIMS
But you haven't seen the ones in
the cages -

NELL
I've seen enough.

She marches resolutely toward the door.



INT. CORRIDOR - ST. MARY'S OF BETHLEHEM - DAY

Nell, with Sims a pace behind her, comes out the double doors
and starts toward the rack.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - the rack with the Quaker in the b.g. Sims
and Nell come up, and Nell reaches for her whip. Sims, with
exaggerated politeness forestays her and hands it to her
ceremoniously.

SIMS
-- but you have no idea how merry
they can be -- what amusement they
afford --

NELL
Amusement? From that mad girl with
her staring eyes?

CLOSE TWO SHOT - Nell and Sims. With a sudden exasperated
movement, Nell lifts the whip and brings it down in a
smashing blow across Sims' cheek.

Sims nursing his cheek, makes a leg, backing away from her.

SIMS
If I have offended you, Mistress
Bowen --

Nell starts to lift the whip and he backs away from her. She
turns and starts rapidly away, flouncing past the Quaker
without giving him so much as a look.

CLOSE SHOT - Sims, as he watches, Nell.

EXT. ST. MARY'S OF BETHLEHEM - NOON

Before the door of the hospital stands a gnarled, misshapened
little valet, wearing postillion boots and holding the
bridles of two blooded horses. One of these horses carries a
side-saddle. They move restively and he calms them by patting
their necks.

Suddenly, the door of Bedlam bursts open and Nell, without
bothering to close it, comes quickly down the steps.  Behind
her in the doorway, the Quaker appears and starts coming down
the steps.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - As Nell comes to her valet. She crosses
quickly to her horse, Varney cups his hand for Nell's foot to
help her mount. As she starts to put her foot between his
hands, she makes a sudden quick movement to transfer her crop
from her left to her right hand. The suddenness of the
movement alarms Varney's horse. It rears and Nell's horse
shies and pulls away from Varney. He tries to hold the reins
as the horse rears and plunges.
Suddenly, Hannay steps in, takes the reins from the little
valet, and after a brief struggle, he subdues the horse,
holds it for a moment patting Its neck to calm it.

NELL
Thank you, sir.
(smiling)
My valet can plait a tress or twirl
a furbelow quicker than a handy
woman, but he has no knack with
horses.

HANNAY
I was glad to do thee this service,
I saw thee strike Sims. Thee should
not have done that.

NELL
Do you think I'm afraid of him? Do
you think he could harm me?

HANNAY
(sailing)
Thee are able enough.  It is the
poor ones in there I'm thinking of. 
Sims will make them suffer for that
blow.

NELL  
Are we lovers, that you "thee" and
"thou" me? I've never seen your
face before,

VARNEY
He's a Quaker, Mistress Bowen,

He goes through an absurd performance of shaking and
shuddering. Hannay looks at him with deep resentment,

HANNAY
My name is William Hannay. I am one
of the Society of Friends.

NELL
(scornfully)
I've heard of them. They turn the
other cheek,

HANNAY
(smiling)
There's more to being a Quaker than
turning the other check, and saying
"thee"  and  "thou".
It's feeling pity for those in
there, as  you did,

NELL
Do you think I struck him because I
felt pity for the loonies?

HANNAY 
I saw it in thy face.

Nell forces a laugh.

NELL
Pity? I had no such feelings, sir.
I struck the man because I wanted
to  because he is an ugly thing in
a pretty world.

HANNAY
There are many ugly things in this
pretty world, if thou would but see
them.

NELL
(looking at him directly)
Master Quaker, I did not always
wear velvet.

HANNAY
(smiling)
Eh, I had guessed that. But where
there is one like thee to wrest
comfort from a hard world with wit
and  cleverness there are ten
thousand who can not.

NELL
I have no pity for them. Let them
do as I did.

HANNAY
But those in there --
(pointing)
Can they help themselves?

NELL
And I have no pity for them, either
-- animals without souls --

HANNAY
That is not thy thoughts.

NELL
Is it not? Come a week hence to
Vauxhall in the evening and you
will see me laughing at those same
loonies you think I pity.

Nell makes a motion to Varney who cups his hands again. Nell
places her foot in his hands and mounts her horse.

HANNAY
Thou will not laugh at the poor and
the afflicted -- not  thee. I have 
seen great ladies and their hearts
were like stone, but thee --

As Varney mounts, Nell looks down at Hannay,

NELL
(gathering her horse)
My heart is a flint,  sir --  it
may strike  sparks,  but they are
not warm enough to burn.     I have
no time to make a show of loving
kindness before my fellow men --
not in this life. I've too much
laughing to do.

She strikes her booted foot against the horse's flank. Varney
rides after her.    Hannay watches them.

FADE OUT

FADE IN

EXT.   THE FETE CHAMPETRE - VAUXHALL GARDENS -  NIGHT

The CAMERA SHOOTING OVER the  necks of two  fiddles

DISCLOSES a night scene  from Fragonard:    At a long table
covered with linen and gleaming with silver is a gay company.   
The men are  in court dress and powdered wigs; the women in
bouffant skirts.    The whole scene is illuminated by
lanterns hung on tree limbs and in the bushes and shrubbery
of the  gardens.

At one end of the table stands a structure not unlike the
tall, narrow apparatus which Punch and Judy shows are given.  
A curtain hangs across the face of this box hiding its
contents from view.

The CAMERA EDGES BACK TO show the two musicians  in the
foreground who sit on the  lawn,  their backs against the
bole  of a great oak.:    One la playing a violin,-the-
other a viola and behind them,   standing leaning against the
trunk of the  tree is another musician with a

Suddenly from the right a tumbler in multi-colored garments 
comes whirling  in, head over heels, a torch in either hand.   
His last violent somersault brings him right side up in front
of the table.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - Lord Mortimer at the  center of the table
with Nell at his right hand and another lady on his left.    
In front of the table  is Sims,  dressed in court satins and
wearing a white wig on his head.    The acrobat, torches in
either outstretched hand, has come to a  stop just beside
him,

REVERSE SHOT -  SHOOTING OVER Lord Mortimer's shoulder. Sims,
grinning, holds the acrobat's head in his hands at table
level, his right hand under the man's chin and his left hand
on top of his head.    The effect is that of a man who holds
a manikin head,   inasmuch as the acrobats face is masked
with a  sharp-nosed Venetian mask through which the eves
gleam in mad fun,

SIMS
(ceremoniously)
--and here,  Milord,   is  the 
spirit of Lunacy to   illuminate
the Golden Age of Reason 

He  releases  the mad acrobat's head.

ANOTHER ANGLE - With a prodigious  leap the acrobat

whirls,  somersaults and lands on his knees  in front  of the  
gaily painted box.    He holds up his  torches and the 
curtains   slowly part to reveal what appears to be a gilded
statue;  the subject a youth crowned with bays, a loin cloth
around his hips and a golden orb and scepter  in his hands,

ANOTHER ANGLE -  to  include  the entire table.    There  is
a stir among Milord's guests; exclamations of delight and a 
light patter of applause.    Sims bows.

SIMS
Lit by Lunacy and speaking with the 
voice of Youth,  the Age of Reason
will  tell you of its brightest
adornment--(with a gesture) Milord
Mortimer.

MED.  CLOSE SHOT - The  gilded boy moves forward to the

little stage-like projection at the opening of the box. For
the  first  time it  can be seen  that this  is not a statue,
but a young boy of about twelve covered from head to  foot
with gold leaf.    Now that his  eyes are open,   they stare
wildly pale in contrast to the gilded skin.    He tries to
speak, gasps, and tries again.

MED. FULL SHOT - with Sims in the foreground.

SIMS
(lightly)
Come Reason, you've wit enough
to say a word or two.

The boy tries again.

MED. CLOSE SHOT -  Lord Mortimer as he half rises and calls
down to the end of the table.

MILORD
What say you to this Wilkes --a mad
boy playing Reason. That's a Tory
joke for you.

MED. CLOSE SHOT ,  The end of  the  table.    Here  sit Lord
Sandwich and John Wilkes.  A pretty girl sits between them 
with numerous  patches on her face.  Wilkes bends across to
speak to Lord Mortimer.

WILKES
...And only the Tories laugh at
it.    The opposition wonders what
the  effect may be on that sick
young boy.    The Tories  care only
for the  jest, we Whigs have  some
concern for the humanities.

MED.  CLOSE SHOT -  Milord.

MILORD
You hear that,  Nell   give them a 
jest and  they answer with a
political tirade.

NELL
He said something about the boy --
the effect --?

MILORD
(carelessly)
Go and ask him. He'll make you a
speech on the matter.

Nell shrugs.

MED.  FULL SH0T - The gilded boy - Sims in the f.g. and part
of the  company at  that end of the  table.

GILDED BOY
To this pretty world 

CLOSE SHOT - Nell.

GILDED BOY'S VOICE
(fumbling over the words)
 pretty world --

She looks thoughtful, then starts to rise.

FULL SHOT - The entire company as Nell starts down toward
Wilkes'  end of the table. (Note to Director:  Please avoid
showing the full figure of the gilded boy as much as possible
by using the voice to gain such effects as can be had.)

GILDED BOY
To this pretty world, there came
Heaven sent, Divinely Inspired -

He breaks off.

SIMS
Good  good  the great voice of
reason.

GILDED BOY 
The blessing of our age 

He stops again.

SIMS
(prodding him with his
cane)
Come, come! I spent all morning
beating it into your head.

The people at the table laugh. The gilded boy drops the
scepter and clutches his throat as if it pained him.

SIMS
(Turning to Lord Mortimer)
You see, Milord, Reason is overcome
with emotion when it must speak of
you.

MILORD
Prod him on, Sims.

SIMS
Come on! A few more of those golden
words I taught you, lad.

GILDED BOY
A man set like a jewel --

MED. CLOSE SHOT - The other end of the table.    Nell is
bending over Wilkes' shoulder to speak to him. He is half
turned.

WILKES
The effect? Somewhere I heard that
the human body must breathe through
its pores. If you shut those pores -

He gestures toward the glided boy.  Nell looks over, nods and
starts back.

Nell looks over.

EXTREME LONG SHOT - The young lunatic in his bright gilt is
writhing in agony. By now the orb, too, has joined the
spectre on the ground. Sims points at him _with his pane. 

SIMS
Another word, good, gentle Reason.

GILDED BOY
(in a voice choked with
pain)
 this prince of men, this paragon -

He stops, fighting for breath.

SIMS
Go on.

CLOSE SHOT - Lord Mortimer with the two ladies on either
side. He is laughing and the hand that holds his wine glass
shakes with mirth and the wine drops over the satin of his
coat and stains the ruffles at his wrist.
The woman at his left bends forward, eager and excited by the
pain she witnesses. Her face is set.

SIMS' VOICE
Go on -- go on!

MED. FULL SHOT -- Sims and the glided boy -- Sims prods at
him with his cane.

GILDED BOY
(forcing it out)
Lord Mortimer -

He falls to the ground and lies still.

FULL SHOT - The table. There Is a general stir, but most of
this movement is the excitement of laughter.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - as Nell comes to stand beside Lord       
Mortimer.                                                                                                         

MILORD
(laughing)
Bless me, Nell, better than                                        
your parrot -- what an eulogy -                                    
from a mad boy freezing with ague                                   
and burning with fevers.                                         

Nell looks at him without replying.                                

MED. FULL SHOT - Sims bending over the boy.  Two footmen with
white aprons over their livery come into the scene.

SIMS
(to the servants)
Duck him in the river -- a
bit of canvas and a handful of
coarse sand will get the gilt off.

As he says this,Nell leans across the table toward him.

NELL
Master Sims 

He turns in her direction.

NELL
Isn't that harsh treatment for a
sick lad?

SIMS
They have to get off the gilt if
he's to be well again.

NELL
So you know that.                                                                          

Sims looks at her with an air of surprise.

SIMS
Know what, Mistress Bowen?                                        

NELL
You know that anyone painted                                                 
over so thick as this poor lad                                         
will die.                                                                                    

ANOTHER ANGLE - the table. This has become more                                 
interesting than the guests had anticipated.  They are
craning forward eagerly some still half-smiling from                
their former laughter.                                                                                           

CLOSE SHOT - Sims.

SIMS
If I understand you properly, this
boy is dying because --

A footman kneeling, beside the boy looks up and plucks at
Sims' sleeve. Sims looks down.

FOOTMAN
The boy is dead, sir.

SIMS
(correcting himself)
-- the boy is dead because his
pores were clogged by the gilt.



GROUP SHOT.

SIMS
Well, then, sweet Mistress Bowen,
as you are such a stickler for the
correct definition, you will grant
me the legal fact that this boy
died by his own exhalations. You
might say  he poisoned himself.

FULL SHOT - the table. As the guests hear this, they burst
into loud laughter.

FOOTMAN
(to Sims)
Where shall we take him?

SIMS
I have told you -- the river 
canvas  sand -- there is no change
in my order.

The servants start to pick up the boy.

ANOTHER ANGLE - SHOOTING PAST Nell as she watches the
servants carry away the limp body of the boy. Then she looks
at Lord Mortimer. He Is pouring wine; his chuckles subsiding.
She looks to the right. A fop is seated there, licking pastry
off his fingers.

NELL
Milord -- have we not had enough of
this?

MILORD
Eh?

NELL
(pointing to Sims)
Enough of this boring, dull man and
his cruelty. "

MILORD
But we're all laughing, Nell.

NELL
I'm not laughing, Milord..

MILORD
He shall make you laugh.
(calling)
Sims!

NELL
Spare me that.

She starts to turn away.

MILORD
But Nell 

NELL
A boy died tonight - a boy -- a
boy who had no mind to guide his
thoughts or deeds  maybe there'll
be some concern about that among
the Whigs. There certainly is none
among the Tories.

MILORD
Oh, you'll find they're laughing
too.

She starts away and he gives her a little push in back as if
it were a benediction and a blessing. She moves off.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - Wilkes, Lord Sandwich and the paramour of
that nobleman.

LORD SANDWICH
Liberty  that is a great word you
Whigs found somewhere, but just the
same, you'll end either with the
pox or on the gallows.

WILKES
That, Milord, depends on whether I
embrace your sweetheart or your
politics.

Lord Sandwich and his companion burst out laughing.       
Wilkes Joins in.                                                            

ANOTHER ANGLE. It is at this moment that Nell comes walking
up behind them. She has not heard what was said; she hears
only the laughter. She looks at them for a moment without
speaking, then with a look of disappointment, walks off.

LONG SHOT - Lord Mortimer's end of the table.

Sims is leading up a young lady whose face is also adorned
with a Venetian mask. This one is fringed and hung with tiny
bells.

SIMS
(with the air of one who
is master of ceremonies)
Here is Alfrieda, Queen of the
Artichokes. She will sing for you.

FULL SHOT as seen from Nell's angle. She hears the roar of
laughter and sees the poor, mad wench trembling at Sims'
side, then turns and passes into the darkness between the
trees. As she does so, a cracked female voice can be heard
beginning the song. "One World's Turned Upside Down."

DISSOLVE

EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT

CLOSE SHOT - a barber shop window. (See Hogarth's painting, 
"Night".)    The window is set with small square panes of
glass.    In each pane is a short candle. This candle-light
illuminates not only the interior of the barber shop but also
a portion of the darkness outside.    Through the window, as
in the Hogarth painting, a barber can be seen shaving a
customer, holding the customer's nose between thumb and
forefinger to steady his head. The CAMERA DRAWS BACK TO show
a doorway at one side of the barber shop.    On this doorway
is lettered

THE SOCIETY OF FRIENDS

Meeting House

As the CAMERA HOLDS on this doorway,  the doors open and
Quaker men and women come quietly out into the street. Some
walk one way, some the other.  William Hannay comes out and
starts down past the barber shop.  As the light from the
candle-lit window falls on him, a voice from the other side
of the street calls his name,

NELL'S VOICE
Master Hannay --

Hannay stops abruptly puzzled.

MED. FULL SHOT - Nell's carriage, parked on the other side of
the street.  Varney opens the door and Nell, in all the
finery she wore at the fete, comes out and  sweeps across the
street, the CAMERA PANNING WITH her.

FULL TWO SHOT - Nell as she comes up to Hannay,

HANNAY
This is a strange place to see
thee, Mistress Bowen,

NELL
(looking around)
A little dull perhaps  but a good
enough place to ask the                                                  
questions I want to ask.

HANNAY
(smiling)
So far, Mistress Bowen, I have
found thee more ready with                                                      
answers then with questions.

NELL   
Don't fear -- my questions are pert
enough. First, do you                                                    
think me a woman of kind heart?  

HANNAY
So I have told thee.

NELL
Why?

HANNAY
I saw thy face at Bedlam  it had
compassion and kindness.

NELL
I have never seen that in my                                                  
mirror. But let's say I grant                                              
the fact  let's say I saw                                                    
things that moved me to pity --                                          
what then, Master Quaker?

HANNAY
Perhaps God sent thee here so that
thee might find guidance -                                           

NELL
From you?

HANNAY
I have not said so.

NELL
Well,  from whom then?

HANNAY
Perhaps he  sent  thee  so that we
might  speak together.

NELL
I have  seen things  tonight  I
have no  liking for   my friends 
laughing at sorry idiots brought
out  from Bedlam to  amuse  them -- 
a poor boy --


HANNAY 
Thou need not tell me. It Is                                                  
a bad time for the poor -- and                                              
people suffer, the ones With wit      
and the ones-without.

NELL
And if you feel sorry for them -
what do you do about all this?

HANNAY
I do what I can. I am a stone
mason.

NELL
How does that help people?

HANNAY
I build well -- let others build as
well  and soon this city will                                    
be a clean and decent habitation.                                         

NELL
But what of me? What can I do? I'm
only a jester to bring laughter to
Lord Mortimer's dinner table.                                            

HANNAY   
Perhaps even in the amusement of                                        
Mortimer there may be a way for
thee to help the poor people in
Bedlam. Is not Mortimer a member of
the Council?                            

She looks at him for a moment, then nods her head.

NELL
Good. You're not such a fool as                                         
I thought you.                                                                              
(suddenly flirtatious and feminine)                                                                    
But why  don't you remove your                                                  
hat  have you no liking for me?                                        

Almost instinctively the Quaker starts to lift his hand           
to his hat brim then stops and brings it down to his              
side.

HANNAY
It is a rule among the Friends to
uncover only before God.                                                      

She  smiles at his confusion. He smiles back at her           

FADE OUT

FADE  IN

INT.   LORD MORTIMER'S ANTE-CHAMBER -  DAY

CLOSE SHOT -  Pompey.  The little colored boy is seated on a
high stool,  examining with a dandified air the polish of his
finger nail.    He  turns  from this elegant diversion to 
the  disdainful  contemplation of some person at  the  other
aide of the  room.

The   CAMERA  PANS WITH his  glance   to reveal  Master Sims
in his  snuff-brown  coat,  his   chin on his  cane,  waiting
as he  waited before.

ANOTHER ANGLE  of   the room -  showing  the  door  to Lord
Mortimer's chamber.    The door opens,  a  gentleman Is                     
= ushered out by a footman, who,  holding the door open,

turns to Sims.                                                                                                         
;'

FOOTMAN Milord will see you now, Master Sims.

Sims rises slowly, crosses to the door and goes through it, 
Pompey watches him with lofty interest. When the ..                          
door closes-behind Sims, Pompey returns to the elegant

examination of his finger nails,

INT. LORD MORTIMER'S chamber - DAY                                                               

Milord, dressed in his small clothes but without his coat, is
seated before his poudoir.  His valet is in attendance.  At
the moment of Sir-is' entrance, Lord Mortimer has his fat
face deep within a paper cone and the valet is sprinkling
powder on his dressed wig,

Nell is seated on a straight chair beside a little table on
which is a plate of biscuits and a glass of wine.  She is
nibbling at a biscuit.

SIMS
(making a leg)
Good morning, Mistress Bowen,

NELL
(gaily)
Good morning.

Lord Mortimer emerges from the powder cone,

MILORD
Ah, there, Sims -- Ah, Sit down                                            
and wait a bit, I've news for you.                                         

He puts his face back in the cone,                                                              

SIMS
(to Nell)
I trust you enjoyed the fete.

NELL
You will hear presently how much I
enjoyed it.

Lord Mortimer emerges from the cone. The valet takes .     ;

it away from him and begins to whisk the loose powder

from his shoulders,                                                                                           
;

MILORD
Sims, you've no idea what we've
decided,  Nell has a splendid

notion.  She wants to turn                                                       


Bedlam upside down -- make all                                              
:

the loonies happy as linnets,

SIMS Mistress Bowen is very kind.

You can't imagine what a  clever

vixen  she  is,  Sims---   thought

it all out before she  oven  spoke

to me  -- beds  -- blankets  --                                            
1

some  to  sow and some   to bake  --

good food  a  practical lass,

SIMS
(smiling)
I can quite understand what
Mistress  Bowen wants.    We've
needed good beds and good food in
Bedlam for a long while,

NELL
You've  forgotten to mention good
treatment,  Master Sims,

SIMS
That, too,  I'm sure we could
afford that.

He pauses, looking at Nell.

SIMS
You can't imagine what gratitude I
bear you, Mistress Bowen,  Those
reforms you propose will make my
name stand out in the history of
Bedlam --

The valet begins to hang a sash around Lord Mortimer's bosom. 
Lord Mortimer rises to facilitate this ministration,

MILORD
(to Sims)
We know you'd agree.

SIMS
I'm overjoyed, Milord,

MILORD
Good  good.
(to Nell)
You see, it's done, Nell -- not a
bit of trouble.

SIMS
There is but one little point,
Milord  the trifling matter of
money.

NELL
(quickly)
Milord has thought of that..

MILORD
Of course  of course - the council
will vote the funds.

SIMS
That is generous of you, Milord
very generous.

NELL
How so, Sims? What sort of
generosity?

SIMS
Does not Milord have property in
Moorfields?

MILORD
A dozen dwelling houses  a
warehouse  two inns. You see,
Sims, I know my accounts,

SIMS
I know your properties. They are
taxable by the institute,
therefore, Milord, this reform
would cost you no loss than five
hundred guineas in additional
taxes.  But what is that to you,
Milord -- a more bagatelle  some
little gift you'd gladly give to
Mistress Bowen,

NELL
I'll relinquish that little gift,
Master Sims.

MILORD
I gave you no gift, Nell.

SIMS
She merely speaks, Milord, of a
gift she's not going to have.  Now
take Master Wilkes -- he would
never be so generous -- he would
say,  "Loonies don't vote."

MILORD
But that's  true.    There is
nothing to be had from them.

NELL
You were going to do this as a kind
deed, Milord.

SIMS
(murmuring)
Five hundred guineas.

MILORD
There would be so much I would have 
to do without.  We'll have to
forget this whim of yours, Nell.

NELL
It is not a whim, Milord. It is the
first thing I've asked of you. 

SIMS
(protesting)
Now, Mistress Bowen, Milord has to
keep up appearances at Court 
that's a great expense to a man.

MILORD
That's true.    You've no idea,
Nell, what a great responsibility
it is to be rich what an expense. 

NELL
It's simply this, Milord  I've
asked you to do a good deed - and
you find the very thought of it too
expensive.

MILORD
You've no right to speak to me that
way, Nell.

NELL
I've all the rights of having put
up with you for almost a year
Milord   trying to make you laugh
and then listening to that fat
laugh of yours as it comes rumbling
out of your fat throat.

MILORD
(sputtering)
Put up with me -- with me --

NELL 
I said so.

MILORD
But look what I've done for you.   
You'd be camping In the rain on
Strathmore  Common with the other
strolling players if you had not
caught my eye.

NELL
Do you call  that weak and watery
vessel your eye?    I would not
want to  look at the  world 
through it. I would not want  to be
a dull man forever  in need of
amusement.  I would not want to
bribe and be bribed -- to fawn upon
the king and kick the commoner  -
in short, Milord,   I would not
want to be Lord Mortimer.

SIMS
Such angry words.

MILORD
(sputtering)
You would not want -- you would not
want --

NELL
(as  she starts for the
door)
Nor do  I want to be with you --
not  for an  instant  longer -
maybe being rich and great and
powerful is  infectious  --  it's a
disease  I don't want  to  catch.
Goodbye,  Milord.

At  the doorway she   turns.    An amused light  comes  into
her eyes.  She first grins, then grimaces and  sticks her
tongue  out at Lord Mortimer,

INT. ANTE-CHAMBER  -  DAY

Nell comes  quickly out  of  the door and passes with a rush
through the  ante-chamber.  Pompey, still seated on  the high
stool,  looks at her in astonishment. And when the wind of
her passage subsides, he sits puzzling out  the meaning of 
this passionate  exit. With a  shrug he gives up  the mental
effort and takes  from his pocket a pair of "conquerors", 
two chestnuts, each tied to a separate string,  which he
proceeds  to  bang together to see which one "wins."    
Then, as the door to the  inner room begins to open, he 
quickly  stuffs  them back Into his  pocket and assumes a
formal air.   Sims  and Lord Mortimer appear in the doorway.   
Lord Mortimer's arm is  familiarly about the shoulders of the 
other man.

SIMS
Of course, as I pointed out to you,
you have every right to take legal
steps --

MILORD
You've been very helpful, Sims.

SIMS
But it grieves me, Milord, to have
been the cause of the quarrel.

He starts to go through the door, with him.

Lord Mortimer goes

MILORD
It was not your fault.  She
quarreled with me. She insulted me.

Sims bows and Lord Mortimer closes the door behind him, Sims
straightens himself; breathes deeply.  Pompey watches him,
then suddenly jumps off the stool, bows and says with great
respect.

POMPEY
May I guide you to the door, Master
Sims?

With assured pride, Master Sims follows the pageboy from the
room.

FADE OUT

FADE IN

INT. NELL'S LODGINGS - MORNING

The place  is  in  an uproar,    A bailiff,  assisted by
several porters,   is  removing  the  furniture.  The 
bailiff has  a paper  in his hand which he waves  angrily
before Nell's  face.  Varney cowers  in  one corner.     The
parrot on  its stand in  the  other corner of the   room is
screaming and flapping its wings. Nell has  a dish  in her
hand and this  dish is  in imminent  danger of being thrown
at the bailiff.

BAILIFF (WAVING THE PAPER)
You know  Lord Mortimer's signature 
--is this not  it?

NELL
I can recognize  a pig's   tracks
when  I  see  them.

BAILIFF
Then you know I have the right to
remove the furniture which he
loaned you.

NELL
Loan does he call it? He and that
loathsome Sims.

BAILIFF
It is all legal -- all by order.

NELL
Oh,  take  it and get out!

She  lifts her hand. The bailiff ducks. She puts the dish
down gently on a  small table. The bailiff picks it up and
hands it to one of the porters.  He crosses the room and
picks up the parrot, stand and all. Varney comes out of his
corner and takes hold of the stand.

VARNEY
That's not Lord Mortimer's.

NELL
Leave Poll alone. She's no present  
to bo given and taken  back.

VARNEY
She's been with Mistress Bowen
since Mistress Bowen played
"Aurora"  in "The Rivals."
(proudly)
We did very well in that.

The bailiff relinquishes  the parrot and looks around the
room which has been  cleared by his men. With a courteous 
tilt of his hat he goes out. Nell looks around her.    There 
is nothing in  the  little room except Varney, herself and
the parrot on the stand.    She begins to laugh.

NELL
Serves me right, Varney.  A kind
heart butters no parsnips.

VARNEY
But what shall we do,   Mistress
Bowen? We've nothing but  the
clothes we wear and poor Poll.                                             

NELL
Poll? Poll's enough---

INT. LORD MORTIMER'S ANTE-CHAMBER - AFTERNOON

MED. FULL SHOT of Sims and Mistress Sims.  Mistress Sims is a
young woman of about thirty. She is dressed in the mode, with
perhaps a little more elegance than an honest woman would
display. Her figure is good and when she moves there is an
assurance and authority in her movements that one would not
readily ascribe to a young and innocent girl. On her face are
several decorative patches; their placement, as was the
manner of the time, dictated by such skin blemishes or marks
of disease as they wore intended to hide.

SIMS
--andremember if gin is offered
you, my dear, you must take wine 
it is more genteel.

MISTRESS SIMS
But I like gin. It makes me merry.

SIMS
You'll be merry enough on wine.

MISTRESS SIMS
But you tell me that Lord Mortimer
likes a witty girl.

SIMS
You'd best leave the wit to me,
I'll make you seem witty.

MISTRESS SIMS
I can crack a joke well enough.

SIMS
Not in good company, my dear niece.
You're not accustomed to it, you
know.

MISTRESS SIMS
(hurt)
I've known some gentlemen.

SIMS
But this is a lord -- a man from
whose largess many blessings can
come to the family of Sims -- and
all for just a little laughter.
That's all he wants  to be amused.

MISTRESS SIMS
A fine lord indeed! Mocked by a
parrot.

SIMS
But that parrot is our key to open
Milord's friendship to you.
Remember, you were offended -- you
offered money --

It is at this moment a footman emerges from the interior
chamber, and, with a bow, gestures to the open door.

HIT. LORD MORTIMER'S CHAMBER - AFTERNOON

Lord Mortimer is at a small Sheraton desk, writing with a
quill pen. He rises to greet his visitors.

SIMS
Milord  a dreadful things --

He catches himself in a pretense that his excitement had
overcome his good manners.

SIMS
Lord Mortimer, this is my niece,
Kitty.

MILORD
A charming person -- she does you
honor, Sims. But have you heard the
latest news of my lady Mistress
Nell? What a jest she's hit upon.

SIMS
You mean the parrot, Milord? It is
because of that we've come here.

MILORD 
(admiringly)
-- A great bit of jest -- what a
vixen!

Sims and Mistress Sims exchange glances.

SIMS
I had hardly thought to find you in
such humor.

MILORD
But it's only a jest.  Nell has the
bird for sale in the market place
letting it scream that silly ditty,
"Lord Mortimer is like a pig, His
brain's small and his belly big."
All London's come to laugh at the
bird.

SIMS
So they have. And It does you no
good, Milord, This joke will make
your proud name a mockery.

MILORD
The bird won't sing too long. I've 
sent Pompey to buy it,

MISTRESS SIMS
(in a rather flat, vulgar tone)
That girl holds the bird at a high
enough price.

Sims darts her a  look.

SIMS
(quickly)
My niece knowing of my affection
for you tried to buy the bird. She
offered twenty guineas and was
refused.

Lord Mortimer starts to cross to a small table on which are
sot out a carafe of wine, glasses and a stone bottle of
Holland gin.

MILORD
Oh, Mistress Bowen wants more
honey, on her bread than that,
Sims." Pompey has a purse with a
hundred guineas in it.

MISTRESS SIMS
(with a glance at Sims)
A hundred guineas for a bird!

MILORD
Will you have some wine, Mistress
Sims?

MISTRESS SIMS
Wine is too French for me, Milord.
It is the way I feel about men. I
like men to be as big as beer and
as strong as gin. Beer has a head
on it, you know.  You can't say
that for wine. Gin has some muscle
to it and you can't say that for
wine either.

Sims tries to give her a warning glance. She takes the drink
of gin Lord Mortimer has poured for her,

MILORD
(watching her)
Bless me, I've never heard anyone
put it that way.   

SIMS
There is much to be said for our
national institutions.

It is at this moment that there is a discreet knock at the
door.

MILORD
Come in.

Pompey enters and as he comes through the doorway he holds up
a purse apparently full of guineas. '

MILORD
She refused?

POMPEY 
She said it was not enough.

MILORD
What sort of game is this?

POMPEY
Mistress Bowen told me to tell you
the bird would remain for sale and
that you could sell every property
you owned and not have money enough
to buy it.

SIMS
Oh  that's the way the wind blows,
Milord.

MILORD
Malign me - The girl digs her spurs
too deep.

Sims beckons and Lord Mortimer follows him to a corner of the
room.

SIMS
(whispering)
Milord, we can always make her my
guest.

MILORD
At Bedlam  no, no. She's as sane
as you and I.

SIMS
Was Colby mad? He was my guest.

MILORD
We've been good comrades,  Nell and 
I.  I'll not do that.

SIMS 
As  you will, Milord.

They start  out  of the two  shot,

MED.   FULL SHOT -   as   the  two men cross  the room to
where Mistress Sims is  seated. Mistress Sims pours a glass 
of gin and hands it to Lord Mortimer,

MISTRESS  SIMS
Here, Milord. Here's confusion to
your enemies.                                                         

Milord  takes  the  glass.  She clinks her glass against his
and they both drink. Sims watches them and smiles,

SIMS
It's a  shrewd trick. You can't re
strain a  parrot  from slander --
you can't exercise  the  right of                             
privacy against a bird.  But  I                                
have  a way, Milord.                                                       

MISTRESS SIMS
Another drink? It will make you a
lion.

Milord  takes  the  drink and swallows it at a gulp.

MILORD
I'm an angry man.                                                                       

SIMS
There  are  laws against  the
depredations  of live  stock,
Milord, is  not  a parrot live  
stock?    Are   you not suffering
loss. You know that, "he who 
steals my purse steals trash - but
he  who --"

MISTRESS SIMS
(interrupting)
Why I heard that at  the 
playhouse.

Sims gives her a look to silence her.

MILORD
What do you  suggest?

SIMS
We can swear out a writ of seizure 
- send a bailiff for the parrot and
have it here within the hour,

MILORD
We could do that.

SIMS
Indeed we can.

MISTRESS SILK
Arrest a parrot? I'll drink on
that, Milord.

She tosses off another glass of Hollands.

INT.   LORD MORTIMER'S  ANTE-CHAMBER  -   DAY

Pompey jumps off his stool and back up against  the wall to 
get  out  of the way as a whole squad of people come 
crowding through.  There  is a bailiff who has Varney
clutched firmly by one elbow while with the other hand Varney
holds onto the parrot.  After then come Nell and Hannay,

BAILIFF
(hauling and tugging at
Varney)
Come along --  come  along.

His  efforts  to push Varney through the  door  into Milord's 
room are  so violent that he blocks  the door instead of
opening it and has to pull Varney around to one side to clear
the doorway.  This momentary stoppage enables the Quaker to
say a word to Nell,

HANNAY
I told thee no good would come of
it. Thee can not mock thy friends
this way.

NELL
Mock him --  he'll wish I'd only
mocked him when I  finish.

HANNAY
Softly.

NELL
Bah!

She flings into the other room after the bailiff and Varney. 
Hannay quietly follows her.

INT. LORD MORTIMER'S BED CHAMBER -  DAY

Milord and Mistress Sims are a bit reddened by the gin they
have  consumed,  but Sims himself is seated elegantly, 
delicately holding up a tiny wine  glass. Milord, his wig a
bit awry goes lurching across the room toward Varney.

MILORD
I swore  I'd wring  its neck. Give
me  that bird,   Varney.

Varney looks fearfully from Lord Mortimer to Nell.

NELL
Your gifts you can take back,
Milord, but the parrot was mine, is
mine and remains mine as long as I
want.

Lord Mortimer lurches forward and seizes the parrot roughly
from Varney's wrist. With one hand he holds it by the body,
the wings fluttering, with the other hand he seizes its neck. 
The parrot squawks piteously. Nell screams. The Quaker steps
forward and with a quick movement, takes the parrot from Lord
Mortimer.

HANNAY
Thee must be careful of other's
property.                                             

MILORD
(making a great bustle to
get at his sword)
Curse you, man! You'll fight me for
this.

Nell takes the parrot from the stone mason; smooths its
disturbed plumage with her hand. Lord Mortimer finally gets
out his sword.

MILORD
(furiously)
Draw man, draw!

HANNAY
As thee can see, I an weaponless, I
do not fight nor brawl with other
men.

MILORD
(furiously advancing and
menacing the Quaker with
his sword)
You will fight me.

HANNAY
I cannot!

MILORD
Fight or  I'll run you through.

He has the point against the Quaker's  chest.

MILORD
Will you not fight?

The Quaker shakes his head,

NELL
Milord --

The muscles of Lord Mortimer's fat arm tense as he prepares
to  thrust. Hannay sees  the  desire  to strike in the 
other's eyes.   With a quick movement  of his arm,  he 
brushes aside the sword and seizes Lord Mortimer by both
arms.

HANNAY
(very quietly)
Friend, thou hast no quarrel with
me.

He gives Lord Mortimer a shove.  Lord Mortimer goes stumbling
backwards, catches his heel on the edge of the carpet and
falls backward into the depths of the feather mattress_ on
his bed,

CLOSE SHOT - Lord Mortimer struggling to get up from the soft
cushions. Nell with the parrot on her wrist bends over him,
laughing.

PARROT 
(shouting)
Lord Mortimer -- Lord Mortimer --

Hannay bends into the scene, takes a firm hold on Nell's arm
and draws her back, saying.

HANNAY
(with a slight smile)
Thee must not mock thy friend.

FULL SHOT - The group,  Hannay takes Nell's arm and quickly
gets her out of the room while the bailiff and Sims rush to
aid Lord Mortimer.

EXT. STONE YARD - AFTERNOON

It is a bright sunny day and the clink of the hammers on the
chisels makes a merry and industrious sound. Two or three
journeymen are busy squaring blocks of granite.  In the f.g.
Nell is seated on a block of cut stone with her skirts lifted
a few inches to protect them from the dust. Behind her stands
Varney with the parrot on his wrist, Hannay stands before her
in his work apron, his sleeves rolled and a sledge in his
hand.

HANNAY
Thee can earn an honest living for
thyself.

NELL
I had to sew my costumes when I was
on the stage.

VARNEY
Two shillings a week and all found
for a seamstress.

HANNAY
One can live well on that if one is
frugal.

NELL
(sighing)
What would I do with Varney? Who'd
have him?

Hannay feels Varney's arm muscles and shakes his head,

HANNAY
Thou hast not strength enough for a
mason, Varney.

NELL
(shrugging)
You see?

HANNAY
Just the same I'll give Varney
work. He can sweep up the dust
here. He has strength enough for
that,

NELL
He sweeps, and I sew -- all very
fine, but not very exciting.
(to Varney)
What do you think of it, Varney?

VARNEY
I like a merry life,  Mistress
Bowen.

NELL
(rising suddenly)
And so by blazes -- so do I!
Everyone makes his living with his
own tricks. My tricks are not
yours, Master Stonemason.

VARNEY
If I may say a word. Mistress Bowen
-- you still have many friends

NELL
That I have! There's Captain
Standing  but he's always talking
about Fontenoy - and Mr. Armiston
and Wilkes - there's Wilkes -

INT. JOHN LARD'S PUBLISHING HOUSE - DAY

This is a small shop opening directly onto the street. The
walls are lined with bookcases and a library ladder serves
the highest shelves. On this ladder a gentleman with a cocked
hat pushed back on his wig sits reading. There are bins of
books on the sidewalk in front of the shop and counters
within. At the rear of the shop is a manually operated
printing press. The shop is fairly well filled with
customers; serious gentlemen who are looking at books,
discussing prints and indulging in political arguments. Sims
is standing near the printing press with a companion, a stout
gentleman who looks not unlike Dr. Samuel Johnson. The CAMERA
is set up to SHOOT THROUGH the press. The press lowers,
stamps and starts to move up. The printer, wearing the
typical box hat of his trade, reaches into the press for the
finished sheet and hands it to Sims.

INSERT     THE FINISHED SHEET.  It is a cartoon by Hogarth
depicting John Wilkes with horns, a tail and a devil's
pitchfork.

BACK TO SCENE - Sims and the other man chuckle and look over
to another corner of the shop.

The CAMERA FANS WITH their gaze to pick up Wilkes and Nell
standing near a small counter. Wilkes has a book in his hand.
He is talking across it to Nell.

WILKES
So far as I'm concerned, dear
Mistress Bowen, you need not teach
your parrot any special phrases for
my benefit.

Nell looks at him for a moment, trying to figure out this
cryptic statement.

NELL
Am I to understand from that,
Master Wilkes that you're not
interested  not in Bedlam nor in
me?

She makes a movement as if to go.  He restrains her by
putting his hand lightly on her arm.

WILKES
I did not mean that. I meant only
that I am a different sort of a man
from Lord Mortimer. I am not easily
pleased.

Again Nell and Wilkes exchange a long silent glance.

NELL
I think you expect too much, Master
Wilkes.

WILKES
I offer more.  You want to fight
the nastiness and the corruption of
Bedlam and I offer you political
alliance with John Wilkes. Bring me
evidence and I'll be pleased to
take it to court.

NELL
Let us say that puts a brighter
face on the matter Master Wilkes .

WILKES
One gives a girl a kiss to seal a
certain kind of bargain, Nell.

NELL
(protesting)
This is a rather public place,
Master Wilkes.

WILKES
(disregarding her)
But one shakes hands with a comrade
and a friend.

He puts out his hand. Smiling delightedly, Nell gives him her
hand.

THE  CAMERA PANS BACK TO SIMS AND HIS COMPANION.

FRIEND
(smiling  at cartoon)
This is a real blow at Wilkes,

SIMS
(looking off at Nell and
Wilkes)
It is a blow I'll leave you to
administer.  I've a blow of his to
ward away.

He puts his hat on his head and starts for the door.

INT. LORD MORTIMER'S CHAMBER - LATE AFTERNOON

A little table has been drawn up to the fireplace and around
this table sit Lord Mortimer, Master Sims and Nell Bowen.

SIMS
-- and so you see, Mistress Bowen,
Milord thought it would --be best
to make friends again.

NELL
On your advice, I suppose, and for
some purpose of your own?

SIMS
(with a resigned gesture)
Milord, speak to the girl.

MILORD
Every word he says is true and
better put than I could say it,

NELL
Well, so we're friends again. You
go your way and I go my way.

SIMS
But friends aren't that off-handed
with each other, Mistress Bowen,
Milord would like to be kind to
you.

NELL
I'm duly warned.  Go on.

Sims holds up a large bank note. After a proper pause to let
Nell take in the full significance and amount of the bill, he
speaks:


SIMS
Milord thinks you've been looking
rather pale as of late  perhaps
the waters of Bath  a rest 

He hands over the bank note.    Nell takes it and looks from
him to Lord Mortimer.  She then reaches out to the tea table
and picks up two pieces of bread as she speaks.

NELL
(to Lord Mortimer)
Milord, you know that I have a
contempt for certain kinds of
money. How deep that contempt is I
am about to show you.

She takes a big bite of the bank-note sandwich, chews and
swallows it then throws the rest of it into the fireplace.

SIMS
(bowing to her across the
table)
The Bank of England thanks you for
three hundred pounds.

Nell rises and cuffs his face for his impertinence. This
makes Lord Mortimer laugh.    With contempt she stalks past
him to the door.

SIMS
(taking papers from his
pocket and putting them
on the table)
Tomorrow after the Commission for
Lunacy examines her she will strike
no more blows  not at you nor at
me.

He drips a pen.

SIMS
Here  you sign here.

Lord Mortimer takes the pen reluctantly and holds it poised
over the paper.

MILORD
But confound me, Sims, I can't sign
this. She's not mad. She's not a
danger to herself and others, as it
says here.   

SIMS
Sign, Milord. She's a danger to my
position and to your properties.
Alone she means nothing. With
Wilkes behind her she's more
dangerous to us than any mad woman.

MILORD
(weakly)
But  I don't  like  to do this.

SIMS
Sign.

INT. THE LUNACY BOARD'S CHAMBER - ST. MARY'S OF BETHLEHEM -
MORNING

This is a medium-sized room.  A peg-board runs around the
walls and on each peg hangs a cooked hat, point down.  (See
Hogarth's "Hudibras" -- Plate IX - The Committee)  These hats
are the only decoration. At one end of the room is a small
barred window.  In the center of the room, three tables are
arranged in a U-shape and covered to the floor with dark
cloth. Around this U-shaped table sit ton commissioners of
lunacy in sombre clothing. Most of them wear either scratch
wigs, periwigs or their own hair, powdered. The three chief
commissioners at the center of the table wear judge's wigs,
the hair curling down to their shoulders, Nell stands before
the opening of the U made by the three tables,

NELL
(rattling on)
I'm twenty-three years of age -
born at Rye -- my parents are dead
and I have no husband nor child --
what more would you wish to know?

CHIEF COMMISSIONER
The Commission of Lunacy will frame
the questions for you, Mistress
Bowen.

NELL
Ask away.

CHIEF COMMISSIONER
Do you know your alphabet?

Nell looks at him with scorn.

NELL
I know A from Zed and I can read
and write as readily as any man I
see before me --
(she takes a look)
Perhaps a little better,

There is no answering smile on the dour faces of the
commissioners,

CHIEF COMMISSIONER
Do you know the difference between
right and wrong?

NELL
What is right for you - that much I
know -- and vice versa.

The Chief Commissioner nods to the man at his left,
knowingly. The man nods back,

NELL
(watching them)
Oh, don't fool yourself, A merry
answer does not make me a fool,
gentlemen.  Ask me a sensible
question and you shall have a
sensibleanswer -

Again the two men look at each other, but the nod is a little
different this time,  Nell has scored a point here.  Behind
the Judges a door opens and James Sims comes through. With a
nod to the commissioners, he pulls up a chair so as to take
his place at the elbow of the Chief Commissioner,  The Chief
Commissioner nods to him. He leans to whisper in the Chief
Commissioner's ear.  The Chief Commissioner looks up at Nell.

CHIEF COMMISSIONER
Mistress Bowen, is it true that
some days past you refused                                            
the sum of one hundred gold guineas
for a parrot not worth                                              
five shillings?

NELL
I had my reasons.  It was a jest.

At the foot of the table, a commissioner looks up at her,

SECOND COMMISSIONER
You know your sums?

NELL
If two and two make four -- I     
do.

CHIEF COMMISSIONER
Knowing that one number added to
another makes a greater number, I
presume you know a large sum of
money from a small sum.

NELL
I only know I like large sums
better than I like small sums.

SECOND COMMISSIONER
Then why did you refuse one hundred
guineas for a parrot worth five
shillings?

NELL
I told you it was a jest.

CHIEF COMMISSIONER
Knowing the value of money,
Mistress Bowen, can you explain why
it was  that you ate a bank note?

NELL
For a jest. The Chief Commissioner
nods.

NELL
Master Sims knows why I ate the
money  to show my contempt for it.

SECOND COMMISSIONER
Is that how one shows contempt?

NELL
No.    But at that moment it was
the only way to show contempt, I
was angry and that's what occurred
to me.

CHIEF COMMISSIONER
Do thoughts, like that always occur
to you when you are angry?

NELL
But surely everyone does foolish
things some times  at a whim  for
a prank    

The Chief Commissioner nods his head.  Sims grins.

SECOND COMMISSIONER
Is it wise to eat money?

NELL
But it was a jest.

A paunchy commissioner laughs,  Sims smiles. The Chief
Commissioner raps with his palm on the table top for order.

CLOSE SHOT - Nell as she looks about, panic growing in her
face,

NELL
Sir  gentlemen  would you permit
me to  communicate  with Mr. John
Wilkes  he would speak for me.

FULL SHOT -  The commissioners.   The  Chief Commissioner
looks  at Sims.  Sims   shakes his  head,

CHIEF COMMISSIONER
(turning back to Nell)
This is not a  court -- you are not 
in need of any witnesses but your
own sanity and we shall judge the
worth of that.

He turns to Sims  and begins to whisper.  The Commissioner on
his right hand and on Sims' left hand bend in to confer.

CLOSE SHOT - Nell as she watches them.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - the end of the table whore Sims sits with
the Commissioner. Nell is in the f.g.  The Chief Commissioner
glances through some papers on the table, picks up a quill
pen and signs his name, then passes the paper to Sims.

CHIEF COMMISSIONER
Mistress Bowen you have asked for
voluntary commitment to enter St.
Mary's of Bethlehem Asylum, The
charges for your care and keep are
to be borne by Milord Mortimer and
I have here  
(he holds up the paper)
the commission's approval of your
request.  The commission has
adjudged you insane.

As he finishes speaking, the commissioners start to rise, get
their hats from the peg-board and start for the door,

NELL
But I made no petition to enter
Bedlam.

CLOSE SHOT -  Sims  as he looks at her and grins.

SIMS
Perhaps you did it in jest,
Mistress Bowen,

He joins the others as they leave the room. Nell rushes
forward into the U formed by the three tables,

NELL
You're not going to  put me  in
Bedlam -- not for a little joke 
not for playing a trick 

They pay no attention to her and continue leaving the room.   
Nell holds out her hands to them and tries to plead with
them.

NELL
Milords  gentlemen  please listen
 I'm of sound mind --I know what I
do -- I know what I say,  I did not
ask for admission to Bedlam --
please  please 

Without looking back at her, they leave the room. Sims is the
last to leave.  He is the only one who looks back. As he goes
through the door, he shuts it behind him. Nell crumples to
the floor in the middle of the U and lies there sobbing.

drawing in around the prostrate girl.)

FADE  OUT

FADE  IN



INT. THE MAIN ROOM - ST. MARY'S  OF BETHLEHEM - NIGHT

BIG HEAD CLOSE UP - Nell,     She is  listening and around
her can be heard strange, low human SOUNDS.  Her eyes are
wide with apprehension and alarm.  She rolls them first one
way and then another following the source  of these soft
SOUNDS.

The  CAMERA  PULLS  BACK to display a  little  of  the  
space around her.     On the walls,  crouching,  rounded
shadows can be  seen moving;   almost as  if animals were 
crawling, indistinct and horrible through terrible  darkness,

ANOTHER ANGLE - MED.   CLOSE SHOT - Nell's face.     On the
wall behind her one of the soft, indistinct  shadows begins 
to grow harder in outline, distinct and erect in appearance
the  shadow of a human.     The  shadow leans toward her.    
She gazes at  it with panic-fixed intensity. Her lower  jaw
falls  slack in  terror as  the  shadow, growing larger, 
comes  closer.    She takes her eyes from the  shadow and
searches in the surrounding darkness  for its source.    
Suddenly, her whole body moves away from what she  sees  in
an  instinctive  gesture.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - REVERSE ANGLE - to show Nell in the f.g.
coming toward her is a man.  His figure is in outline.

CLOSE SHOT - Nell as her mouth begins to form a scream.  The
scream is topped by the hard, sudden metallic sound of chains
being flung down.  She looks wildly in the other direction.

LONG SHOT - Toward the door from Nell's angle.  Coming toward
her are three men with pieced lanterns.  The three moving
blobs of light are fantastic and eerie in the room.  They
come steadily toward her, revealing themselves as Master
Sims, attended by two guards.  One of the guards pushes him
aside.

CLOSE TWO SHOT - Sims and Nell.    Sims comes up to Nell,
holds his light over her face and grins down at her.  He
fumbles in his pocket, pulls forth a coin and holds it up.

SIMS
Here in Bedlam, my dear, we cannot
feed you bank notes.

He forces the penny he holds between her teeth.

SIMS
Try chewing on this.

DISSOLVE                               

INT. LORD MORTIMER'S CHAMBER - MORNING

CLOSE SHOT - Poll the parrot. A man's hand comes into the
frame and presents a cracker to Poll.

MILORD'S  VOICE
Polly wants a cracker.

POLL
(repeating)                                                          
Polly wants a cracker.

The CAMERA PULLS BACK TO disclose Lord Mortimer in very tight
white riding breeches and boots.  Varney is holding the
parrot before him. On the floor around them are open trunks
and portmanteaux.

MILORD
(looking up brightly)
You see, Varney, now that he is
mine, I've already taught him a new
and original trick,

VARNEY
Yes, Milord.

There is the SOUND of a door opening and both look off.

ANOTHER ANGLE - MED. LONG SHOT - to show Mistress Sims In mob
cap and mantalet as she comes in from the ante-chamber.

MILORD
Ah, my love -- and how did you
spend the night?

Mistress Sims ignores him and looks at the trunks.

MISTRESS SIMS
Are you going on a voyage, Milord?

MILORD
Oh, no, not a voyage.  Just a trip
to the country to ride -- to smell
the innocent air -- to listen to
the twitter of the birds -- to
rusticate -

MISTRESS SIMS
(pointing to the tight
trousers)
I see  to rusticate,

MILORD
I would invite you, my dear, but
it's a bachelor occasion -- sport,
you know -- manly things.

MISTRESS SIMS
(still eyeing the tight
trousers)
I see.

She shrugs.

MISTRESS SIMS
Well, all good things must end,
Milord, I'll have a bit of the gin.

She crosses over to the buffet and pours herself a                        
glass.  She drinks.                                                                                          

MISTRESS SIMS
And another little sip to take away
the dry taste of piety.

She downs the rest of the gin.

MILORD
Piety? I thought there was precious
little of that in this house.

MISTRESS SIMS
There's a Quaker outside who wants
to see you. Pompey is sending him
about his business.

Varney looks up from attending the parrot.



INT. LORD MORTIMER'S ANTE-CHAMBER - DAY

From his high stool Pompey is holding forth to Hannay.

POMPEY
- such a person has never been
known in this household.

HANNAY
Come now -- thou must know that to
be an untruth. Nell Bowen had tea
with Milord only yesterday.

POMPEY
(shaking his head)
Your young lady was the one who
was telling tales. There's been no
woman in this house but Mistress
Sims since I can remember  so they
tell me.

Hannay looks at him. He knows it's useless to ask further,

HANNAY
Well, never mind.

He turns and leaves the room. Pompey watches him off, then
digs into the pocket of his jacket and takes out a piece of
toffee. He begins to munch it. The door from the bed chamber
opens. Instantly, Pompey thrusts the toffee back into his
pocket, then reaches for it again as he sees that it is only
Varney.

VARNEY
Where is the Quaker?

POMPEY
He's been and gone.

VARNEY
He must have just left.

POMPEY
That's likely. 

Varney gives him a dirty look and hustles off in pursuit of
the Quaker.

DISSOLVE

EXT. THE STONE MASON'S YARD - DAY

Hannay in his street clothes comes slowly down the street and
passes under the block and tackle. From behind him comes a
shout. He turns.

VARNEY'S VOICE
Master Hannay -- Master Hannay -

Hannay who has turned at the sound of his name, waits and
Varney comes running In to him.

VARNEY
(excited and out of
breath)
I'll tell you where she is, Master
Hannay.  I'll tell you where she is
-- they put her in Bedlam.                            

HANNAY
In Bedlam?

VARNEY
Aye  --  yesterday -- they summoned
her.     She's  there, now.

HANNAY
Well -- friend -- thee must come
with me. We shall go to Bedlam.

VARNEY
No, no.  I can't go with you. I'm
employed by Milord,

Hannay looks et him. Varney quickly explains,

VARNEY
You see, Master Stonemason, I have
to live.

He lifts his arm.

VARNEY
And you, yourself, said I haven't
muscle enough for honest work.

HANNAY
It is enough that thee is an honest
man, Varney -- that thee ran all
this way to tell me where she  is.

INT. THE MAIN ROOM - ST. MARY'S OF BETHLEHEM - DAY

MED. FULL SHOT - the pillar near which Oliver Todd is busily
writing at a small table.  The author is engrossed in his
work, his quill pen flying, the point creaking and scratching
on the paper.  Near him slouches Sidney Long, a tall, slim
man, who continually thumbs the edges of a book.  A shaft of
light strikes past them and in the murky depths of the room
on either side the dim figures of other mad men and women can
be seen.  Nell stands near them, looking fearfully about her. 
Suddenly from far off a voice can be heard calling.

VOICE
Nell Bowen  Nell Bowen --                                                    

CLOSE SHOT - Nell as she looks.  Other voices take up the
chant of her name.

VOICES
Nell Bowen -- Nell Bowen -- Nell
Bowen --

She looks about puzzled.

MED. FULL SHOT - the group near the pillar.  The voices are
still calling and Nell's anxiety and curiosity verges on
terror.  She looks around to find the source of this weird
chanting.  Sidney Long looks up from his book and sees her
anxiety.

LONG
Is that your name they

Nell nods.

NELL
How do they know I am here? 

LONG
They don't know.   Some of our poor
companions spend their days looking
out the window.  If they hear a new
cry they repeat it, then others
take it up and so it goes.

NELL 
But my name -- how do they know?

LONG
Someone  shouted in the  street --
someone trying to reach you.

NELL
(gratefully)
Oh -- thank you -- thank you.

Long points with his finger and she runs off in that
direction.

LONG SHOT - Nell running through the alternate light and
darkness of the main room.

MED. FULL SHOT - Nell as she comes up to the window. Her name
is still being called. 
Three lunatics, two men and a woman, are hanging out the
window. She forces her way between them and bends out over
the sill.

CLOSE SHOT - Nell,  She looks up and down the street. The
three patients watch her with meaningless, uncomprehending
eyes.  Finally she turns away in disappointment.

EXT. ENTRANCE - ST. MARY'S OF BETHLEHEM - DAY

William Hannay is just mounting the steps.

INT. CORRIDOR - ST. MARY'S OF BETHLEHEM - DAY

At the arms rack stand two warders.  One of them is taking
the admission fee from a young apprentice all done up in
holiday finery, with his lass on his arm. The other warder
hangs up the boy's cudgel on the arms rack. The little
business of entry fee and weapon checking having been gone
through the young couple are admitted into the main room just
as Hannay comes up to the arms rack. Without a word he holds
out a two-penny piece.  They look at him, then at each other.
The older of the two warders shakes his head.  The younger
speaks.

YOUNG WARDER
(in a surly voice)
You can't come in.

HANNAY
By George Sims' order I suppose.

YOUNG WARDER
Even so.

During this conversation the older of the two warders has
slipped away in the direction of Sims' office.

HANNAY
And may I see Sims?

YOUNG WARDER
(with a jerk of his head)
And quickly too.

Hannay looks around in the direction of the warder's nod

REVERSE ANGLE - Sims, with the older warder, is coming toward
him. 

TWO SHOT - as Sims and Hannay meet.

HANNAY
I've been refused admittance.

SIMS
That is unfortunate -- but a  new
ruling -- you understand --                                            

HANNAY
I understand only that I am a free
man -- that I have money in my
hand.  You have no legal right to
deny me entry to a place where
others have been admitted.

SIMS
Quite true -- quite true.

HANNAY
Well?

SIMS
The warder will take your tupence.

The older of the two warders takes Hannay's money,

SIMS
And now if you will leave your arms
at the arms rack --                                                           

HANNAY
I have no arms.  I am of the
Society of Friends.                                                                       

SIMS
Then I'm afraid we must return your
tupence.

HANNAY
But why?

SIMS
Did you not quote the law to me?
Let me then quote law to you -- It
is a rule of our institute that any
who go into the main hall must hang
their arms upon that rack.

HANNAY
But I have no arms.

SIMS
Since you have none, I cannot let
you enter.

HANNAY (FURIOUSLY)
Thou cannot deny me entrance for
such cause.

He takes a step toward the door and tries to push it open. It
is looked. The two warders and Sims grin.

SIMS
I must.

For a moment the Quaker stands silent but furious as if ready
to try physical conclusions with the two warders, then he
collects himself, shrugs and walks off.

SIMS (CALLING AFTER HIM)
It is a rule, and I break no rules,
Master Quaker.

Hannay walks off without turning around.

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE OF ST. MARY'S OF BETHLEHEM - DAY

This is a portion of the street which has not been seen
before. The street at the side of the hospital. In the street
is a horse-drawn stone sledge and several hand wains. On the
sledge are three great pieces of cut granite and in the wains
are tubs of mortar, trowels, chisels and other impedimenta of
the mason's craft.

Three young masons are at work sliding one of the cut stones
onto a litter. They catch sight of someone off scene.  One
mason nudges another. They stand up. Hannay comes strolling
into the scene.

FIRST STONE MASON
Brother Hannay  I'll be blasted --
sauntering as  if it were a
holiday.

HANNAY
On my own business, friend Smith,
and without profanity.

SECOND STONE MASON
And without this good job of work
that we have, Hannay.

HANNAY (PLEASANTLY ENOUGH)
I bid for it.

SECOND STONE MASON
And found Master Sims' way of
doing business a little strange,
eh?

FIRST STONE MASON
(turning to his work)
We've the work -- we've the will 
let's at it boys!

They bend to the stone again-and start heaving to get it into
place.

HANNAY
But you haven't the knack of it.

He bends down and gives a heave and the  stone  slides easily 
down the rollers and onto the litter,

FIRST MASON
(wiping the sweat off his
brow)
Thanks, Hannay.

SECOND MASON
Maybe you'd give us a hand.

THIRD MASON
There are but three of us.

HANNAY
I'd just as leave.

The four men take their places  about the litter.

FIRST MASON
(to Hannay)
You call.

HANNAY
One  two  heave, all.

With a great surge they force the litter up onto their
shoulders.

HANNAY
Lead away.

The two men at the front of the litter start up a short ramp
into the building.

INT. ST. MARY'S OF BETHLEHEM - DAY

A long narrow corridor. The four masons carrying their cut
stone come along the corridor to a place where it leads into
a slightly wider but darker hall. Here a candle is hung in
the wall and there is evidence of mason's work.  The first
two masons come up to this place and halt.

FIRST MASON
Call!

HANNAY
One, and two and down we go!

Simultaneously they lower the litter. All four stand around
the stone, wiping their brows, hitching up their aprons;
laxing off the tension of hard muscular labor.                                                                  

FIRST MASON
Thanks, Hannay.

HANNAY
Thee is welcome.

SECOND MASON
Now you're here, Hannay, you can
see all of Bedlam without paying
your tupence. Can't he, lads?

They all nod. The first mason winks.  Hannay pretends not to
have noticed the wink and the jocular air of the two others.

FIRST STONE MASON
Oh, aye -- indeed you can. All the
wonders of Bedlam for nothing.

HANNAY
(quietly)
That I would like to see.

THIRD STONE MASON (POINTING)
This corridor leads to the main
room.

SECOND STONE MASON
It's a little dark maybe, but If
you get to the end of it, Hannay,
you'll see an eyeful.

HANNAY
Down this way?

They nod.

HANNAY
If thee don't mind I'll go and
look.

He starts down the long corridor and Is lost to view. The
three masons stand looking after him, grinning.

FIRST MASON
He'll be back soon enough.

SECOND MASON
(laughing and slapping his
leather apron)
Never fear.

THIRD MASON
Like a shot from a gun.

INT. CORRIDOR - ST. MARY'S BETHLEHEM - DAY

Very little light comes into this dark corridor; only light
enough to show that at intervals there are strong, iron
barred doors like the entrance to cages of wild beasts. The
corridor is narrow and Hannay gropes his way through the
darkness toward a dim light at the very end.

CLOSE SHOT - Hannay as he gropes his way.  His hand passes
from the solid wall onto the bars of one of the doors. Prom
the darkness of that room a white, ghastly hand Is suddenly
thrust and seizes his wrist. He struggles to pull away from
the clinging grip of these thin fingers.  Finally, he pulls
away, but this exertion has brought him back against the door
on the other side of the corridor. His gaze is still fastened
on the door from which the hand was thrust, when a sudden
burst of maniacal laughter explodes against his ear. He
whirls.

REVERSE SHOT - An old woman with wild eyes and streaming
white hair thrusts her face between the bars at his shoulder.

MED. FULL SHOT - Hannay as he proceeds.

TRUCKING SHOT - As Hannay quickens his stride and looks from
one barred door to the next, eluding hands -which reach out
for him, fists that are shaken and all around him the
screaming and laughter of the incurably insane.

MED. FULL SHOT - As Hannay comes up to the door at the end of
the corridor. This door, which leads into the main room of
Bedlam, has a cross-barred window set into it.

LONG SHOT - Through the window from Hannay's ANGLE.

TRUCKING SHOT - As Hannay quickens his stride and looks from
one barred door to the next, eluding hands which reach out

MED. FULL SHOT - As Hannay comes up to the door at the end of
the corridor.  This door, which leads into the main room of
Bedlam, has a cross-barred window set into it.

LONG SHOT - Through the window from Hannay's ANGLE.  He sees
the sun-striped interior of the main room.  At the far end
near the pillar where Long and Todd habitually sit, he can
see Nell.

CLOSE SHOT - Hannay.

HANNAY
(calling softly)
Nell  Nell Bowen 

FULL SHOT - Nell at the pillar.  She hears her name, turns
and than relaxes as again the chorus of the insane take up
the chant of her name. 

VOICES
Nell Bowen  Nell Bowen --

MED. CLOSE SHOT - Hannay through the window. He, too, hears
the chanting of the name; is puzzled and confused.

VOICES
Nell Bowen -- Nell Bowen --

Finally the shouting subsides.

LONG SHOT - Nell Bowen as seen from Hannay's ANGLE.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - Hannay again cups his hands and calls
softly.

HANNAY
Nell Bowen 

Again the queer and confused chanting of the name springs up.

MED. FULL SHOT - Nell. She listens, half confused, half
disgusted, only hoping for the irritating SOUND to stop. It
diminishes and dies away. She relaxes.

CLOSE SHOT - Hannay at the window. He tries again.

HANNAY
Nell Bowen 

Again the chant breaks out.

FULL SHOT - Nell. For the third time she hears the SOUND of
her name being called by myriad voices. She starts slowly for
the window.

FULL SHOT - The back of Hannay's head at the window and Nell
passing toward the other window.

VOICES
Nell Bowen -- Nell Bowen 

Hannay shouts her name, but it is a shout lost among the
others. She is about to pass out of sight when she looks
over. He reaches his arms through the bars and waves. She
catches the gesture and starts toward him. Some ten feet from
the window she stops and looks to the right. From his
position and the position where the CAMERA is set up, what
she sees cannot be seen.

HANNAY
(encouraging her)
Come Nell -- Nell 

She makes a sudden resolution and with one or two fearsome
glances to the right, comes quickly up to the window and
grabs hold of Hannay's arm.

ANOTHER ANGLE - SHOOTING FROM the corridor TOWARD the main
room. Nell has come up to the barred door. The shadow of bars
falls across her face and on the floor. Across those shadows
another shadow moves, grim, grotesque and huge. As she and
Hannay talk the shadow keeps passing and repassing, partially
on the floor and partially on her face. She continues to
cling to his arm, holding onto this link to the sane world
with frantic intensity. Hannay comforts her.

NELL 
You've come to take me away.

HANNAY
(shaking his head)
No.  There is no way.

NELL
Find Wilkes. He'll get me out

HANNAY
I had thought of that. I'll seek
him out, but until he can free
thee, thee must be patient.

NELL
Patient? How can I be patient? I'm
terrified -- these people are like
beasts.

She glances off to the unseen figure on her right.

HANNAY
So thou has that same thought --the
same thought as Sims.

NELL
No. But they frighten mo. They're
dirty -- savage -- mindless 
disgusting --

HANNAY
(patiently)
Thee wanted to help them  they put
thee here -- for trying to aid
them.

NELL
I still want to aid them, but I can
not here -- not here where they are
all about me. All I want is release
or a weapon to defend myself.

HANNAY
Thee has thy kindness and thy
courage -- they can be sword and
buckler to thee in this place.

NELL
I want better weapons -- I want
something more than my naked hands
to help me if there should be
trouble. Give me a weapon.

HANNAY
Thee knows that I carry no sword.

NELL
Anything.

Hannay shakes his head.

HANNAY
I carry nothing that could harm my
fellow creatures.

NELL
(pointing)
Your trowel.

He looks down to where his trowel is stuck through his broad
leather belt.

HANNAY
That is to build with.

NELL
It has a point -- it has a handle.

Hannay shakes his head, again. Nell looks at him.

NELL
Would you have me maimed --
scratched - scarred?

She looks at him. 

NELL
My face?

HANNAY
The Lord will not let it happen,

NELL
Give me the trowel and I will not
let it happen.

He shakes his head again.

NELL (MORE SOFTLY)
Look at my face again  look close 
- shall it be scarred?

The Quaker stands looking at her for a moment, then he pulls
the trowel from his belt and hands it to her.

HANNAY
God forgive me for what I do.

NELL
(seizing the handle of the
trowel)
Forgiven or not, at least I can
defend myself.
Now get to Master Wilkes. Wilkes
will have me out of here like that.

She snaps her fingers. Hannay looks at her, then starts away
past the camera.

INT.  JOHN LARD'S PUBLISHING HOUSE  - AFTERNOON

Lard, himself, a square, well-fed man,  is operating the
printing press. Between the rhythmic banging of the press, he 
talks with Hannay.

LARD
I haven't seen Wilkes for the last
week.

HANNAY
He's never at home.

LARD
He's electioneering.

HANNAY
But where?

LARD
Anywhere in the Kingdom.

HANNAY
It is a matter of import  grave
import -- a woman's reason hangs on
It.  I must see him.

LARD
He has ordered pamphlets and
posters from me. He has to come
here. When he does, I'll tell him.

HANNAY
(starting to turn away)
I'll be back tomorrow.

INT. MAIN ROOM - ST. MARY'S OF BETHLEHEM - NIGHT

The great hall is feebly lit with a few rush lights hung on
the walls. But near the pillar is a pool of light from a wax
candle set up on Todd's desk. By its light, he is still
writing while Long stands beside him still engrossed in the
edged leaves of his book. He is flipping them past his thumb.
Well is seated on a stool near then, but with her back toward
then. At the next pillar Dorothea the Dove stands mutely
beautiful. The other inmates are dim moving bulks in the half
light. Suddenly from afar comes the booming of Big Ben
striking eight o'clock. Long lays down his book, takes a
greasy pack of cards from his side pocket and shows them to
Todd. Todd lays down his pen and clears the desk before him*

LONG
(looking off at Nell)
We night ask her, Master Todd  she
seems quite lady-like  quite sane,
or as I might express myself before
the bar, compos mentis en lex.

Todd nods.

LONG
Then I shall ask her. We can have
Dan. The four of us can play
Paroli.

Todd nods. Long goes off.

TWO SHOT as Long comes up to Nell.  He makes a graceful leg,   
Nell looks up at him.

LONG
(formally)
...Madame, would you care to join
us? We are going to play Paroli,

NELL
That's kind of you. But I have no
money,

LONG
Money? We play on our word.

NELL (RISING)
I have a wealth of words;     I
don't cheat but I warn you I'm not
above amending  the mistakes of
fortune.

FULL SHOT - Todd, Dan the Dog at the desk as Nell and Long
come up, Todd rises quite reasonably, Dan the Dog crouches
over the chair with a vacuous grin. Long introduces them.

LONG
This Mistress Brown, is Oliver
Todd, He will not speak to you, nor
to me, but there is no harm in him
and he writes and reasons well. And
this Is Dan, sometimes he fancies
himself a dog -- sometimes the
rider of a spirited horse, but he
has no malice in him and he
remembers how to play cards. I am
Long -- Sidney Long, the Crown
Solicitor  whose enemies will not
let him practice at the bar! I, the
most skilled of them all, I have
many enemies  many, many enemies.

NELL
(soothingly)
I understand.

LONG
I should not have told you that.
But believe me, we who are near
this pillar are the safe ones --
the good ones  the wisest --that
is why they let us have the candle 
- but the rest  you must be
careful of the rest.

NELL
(feeling her
skirt where
the trowel
is hidden)
I am careful.

LONG
Let us begin the play.

Nell seats herself and the rest also take their places around
the desk.  Long shuffles the cards,

LONG
I will hold the bank -- twenty
thousand pounds 

He indicates an empty space on the desk, Nell looks at him
and then at the empty space and points to the empty space
before her.

NELL
Five pounds for a card,

LONG
Five pounds.

He passes her a card, Todd holds up the five outstretched
fingers of one hand. Long passes him a card, Dan looks from
one empty space on the desk to the other and nods sagely,

DAN
Five whippets, ten bassets, one
gaze hound.

Long looks at him and passes three cards,  Nell looks at her
partners in this mad card game with a little smile on her
lips.

LONG
Does anyone wish another card?

NELL
Five pounds.

He passes her another card. Long looks to the others. They
shake their heads.

LONG
Banko.

Everyone turns up his cards and looks.                                                    

NELL
Paroli.

LONG
Fortune smiles at your first play.
What card?

NELL
(holding it up)
Knave of Spades.

L0NG
You win.

They all pass back their cards. As Long shuffles then the
sound of heavy chains moving and a man groaning can be heard
in the darkness. Nell looks off. The others pay no attention.
Long deals. Todd holds up three fingers.

DAN
Eight bulldogs.

Again the painful groan is heard from the darkness.

NELL
What's that?

LONG
A poor wretch  Sims gave him a
dose of iron this morning. The
chains scruff his flesh.

NELL
Will the warders not help him?

LONG
They've heard too many groans to
bother.

NELL
But what about you? Don't you ever
help the others?

LONG
Why should we help? We are the
people of the pillar.

The groaning sounds out again.

LONG
A card?

NELL
Wait.

She listens to the sound of the groan.

NELL
I can't play with that going on.  
May I have the candle?

LONG
Be careful of the straw.

Nell picks up the candle and starts toward the direction of
the groaning sound.

LONG SHOT - Nell, as she, threads her way between the
sleeping figures of the loonies.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - Nell stops to listen, trying to orient
herself by the sound of the groaning. She starts off.

MED. CLOSE DOLLY SHOT -Nell following the sound of the
groaning. Suddenly, it stops. She stops with it. Then it
begins again. Again she goes forwards

CLOSE SHOT - Nell. She pauses. The groaning is very near. She
looks around her at the huddled figures, lifting the candle
high, trying to distinguish among them the injured man. She
holds the candle in her left hand and looks to the left. From
the right comes the clang and jangle of heavy chains. She
whirls, her right hand-seeking the trowel.

CLOSE SHOT - from Nell's ANGLE. Right before her stands a
half-naked lunatic encumbered with his "dose of iron." This
is a curious and frightening contraption of steel plate and
chain, a terrifying travesty of chivalrous armor. For a
moment, they stand en tableau, Nell with the candle upraised
on her left hand, the trowel held dagger-wise in her right;
then the man groans.

NELL
(whispering)
Do your, chains hurt you?

The man nods. Nell places the candle warily on the ground,
clearing a space in the straw with her foot before him. Then
she turns to the man again.

NELL
Where does it hurt?

The man gestures with his head toward his restricted elbow. 
With her free hand Nell touches it.

NELL
Here?

The man nods.

NELL
Would it help if I put a bit of
cloth there to ease the chain?

Again he nods. She tears a little strip from her fichu and
with her left hand, starts to stuff it under the chain at the
man's elbow. It is awkward, one-handed. She draws back, looks
at him, then puts the trowel down on the ground next to the
candle. With her two hands, she easily tucks the cloth under
the chain, then tears another strip and oases the burden on
his other elbow.

NELL
Better?

He turns his head painfully. Nell tears a third strip and
tucks it in at the collar of the contraption. He smiles. She
smiles back at him, bends to pick up the candle and starts
back toward the pillar.

MED* CLOSE SHOT - the pillar. In silhouette can be seen the
three figures of Dan the Dog, Todd and Long. Beyond them,
Nell's candle can be seen advancing through the darkness,
then finally she herself is disclosed In this moving pool of
light as she comes up to the desk and sets the candle down.

LONG
He's quiet now. That was kind of
you.

NELL
It's just that I don't care for sad
music with my game of paroli. Let
us play.

LONG
A card?

NELL
Five pounds.

LONG
Any others?

LONG SHOT - SHOOTING PAST the group of card players TOWARD
the main door.   Dorothea, and her pillar are in the
perimeter of the candlelight.   Out of the darkness behind
her, his hands folded behind his back, Sims appears.   He
watches the card players for a moment. Then, almost absently,
he lifts his hand and pats Dorothea's cheek.

CLOSE SHOT - the four card players, as Sims comes quietly up
to them. They look up.

SIMS
A very pleasant group you make,
dear people.

They all look at him without answering, Dan crouches away,
making soft, placating SOUNDS, He disappears into the
darkness.

SIMS
It's so nice to find you here among
the upper classes, Mistress Bowen.
But then it is exactly where I
expected you to be.
It's a law of physics -- the
lighter elements, like scum, rise
to the top.

NELL
I thank you, Master Sims -- a
delicate compliment -

SIMS
(bowing his acknowledgment)
I see that you have joined what
little we have of society -- the
group around the pillar. Is this
the brotherhood your Quaker friend
preaches? Or perhaps you're afraid
among the rest  those dark shadows
I see about me --

NELL
I'm not afraid.

SIMS
Then you've forgotten.

NELL
Forgotten what?

SIMS
Forgotten that you were going to
reform Bedlam -- cleanliness and
soft beds for the delight of the
patients -- good treatment  Well,
you've been here a week, Mistress
Bowen and your only friends are
these  our nobility.
(sneering)
The brotherhood of man --

NELL
And give me clean straw -- I'll
make beds for them. Bandages  and
I'll bind their wounds  water and
soap --

SIMS
That would delight me to too. You
shall have water -- you shall have
soap -- you shall have straw
enough. I hope you make good use of
it.

NELL
I shall.  Never fear.

SIMS
But now I leave you to dream about
these Augean labors. May you find
your dreams sweet and cleanly.

He turns and goes toward the door. On his way, he again
passes Dorothea and again pats her cheek.

FADE OUT

FADE IN

EXT. ST. MARY'S OF BETHLEHEM - EARLY MORNING 

A few people pass along the street.

INT. MAIN ROOM - ST. MARY'S OF BETHLEHEM - EARLY MORNING

CLOSE SHOT - Oliver Todd is busily writing. The camera is set
up on his back.

GRAY'S VOICE
But where is it  you promised a
chapter for today.

The CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL BACK TO Master John Gray, stationer
and publisher, a well-fed man. He is bending over Oliver,
berating him testily, Sidney Long, his book in his hand,
slouches nearby.

GRAY
I appeal to you. Master Long  is
it fair? I support his family 
feed his children  even pay my
tupence to come in and get my
script and it is not ready.

LONG
We've been busy. We've been helping
Mistress Bowen.

GRAY
Mistress Bowen  who is she?

Long points.

LONG SHOT.  A thin crowd of people are gathered at one place. 
The camera is set up to show the crowd but not what they are
working at.

CLOSE SHOT - Nell, in the middle of the crowd of loonies. 
They are stupidly staring while she bulks together a heap of 
straw and covers it as neatly as she can with a thin blanket.   
Beyond her,  other similar pallets can be seen neatly
arranged along the wall.  The loonies watch her stupidly.   
She finishes making up the pallet, dusts off nor knees and
starts down the hall.

MED. FULL SHOT - Gray, Long and Todd.

GRAY
Oh - a new female warder -- now
about a next chapter 

LONG
Not a warder, Master Gray -- an
inmate like ourselves who does all
she can to help her fellow
sufferers.

GRAY
What can she do?

LONG
Look, I'll show you.

INSERT

THE PAGES OF THE BOOK as they flutter past, revealing that a
series of drawings have been made; drawings which are
animated by the movement of the  pages.

These animated drawings show a girl feeding a person in bed;
reading to a man chained to a wall.    As the pages flutter
past, Long's voice can be heard.

LONG'S VOICE
What can she do you ask?    She can
feed those who have not wit enough
to feed themselves -- she can wash
the helpless   cheer, the
despondent   she  can --  she is
an angel in this darkness.

BACK TO SCENE.

GRAY
Very interesting -- but this book
you have   those drawings-

LONG
Oh --  the pictures  you don't
half their wonder,  Master Gray 
(enthusiastically)
If I could only get a light behind
these pages I could throw them
large as life up on the wall.

GRAY
Aye -  that's not a bad notion one
could charge admission. You could
even tell the story Todd's writing
that way.

LONG
(in the manner of one 
imparting a secret)
You forget --  it's because of
these pictures that I'm here --
that and because I'm the best
lawyer in England,   I, the most
skilled of them all.

GRAY
Oh, yes, that's true.

He turns to Todd.

GRAY
And you,  Oliver  You'd best
finish that chapter by tomorrow or
I'll withdraw my support from your
family.    Understand?

Without, turning, Todd nods his head.

OMITTED.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - Nell, as she comes along the corridor
behind the pillars.  She passes Dan lounging against a pillar
and stops to-speak to him.

NELL
Dan, did you chance to see a
trowel?

DAN
A trowel? I'll build you a wall  a
wall that high.

NELL
Master Long, have you seen a
trowel?

LONG
I beg your pardon.

NELL
A trowel  a mason's instrument. I
mislaid it some days ago.  I'd like
it back.

LONG
Oh, yes -- a trowel.

He looks suspiciously at Nell.

NELL
I'm not mad, Master Long. I had a
trowel.

LONG
(comfortingly as to a
child)
Oh, certainly, Mistress Bowen.
We'll help you find it.

Nell shrugs hopelessly at him and smiles.

NELL
You think I'm mad. Sometimes I
think I've gone mad myself,
scrubbing and making beds and all
for people who don't even know that
I'm trying to help them.

LONG
They know.



INT. DOOR OF THE MAIN ROOM - ST.  MARY'S OF BETHLEHEM - DAY

Sims,  attended by two guards,   comes through and starts
down the room.   He comes up to the  group around the pillar.   
Dan is  slightly in his way.   He  raises his arm
threateningly.    Dan merely looks at him with a stupid sort
of interest but no fear. Sims looks puzzled for a moment,  
then pushes  the  idiot out of his way..

SIMS
Good morning,  Mistress Bowen 

Nell nods  to him in dignified greeting.

SIMS
(looking about)
What a happy place this has become.
Everything is so much cleaner --
the idiots even have their faces
washed.
Only a little time and this
wonderful change in Bedlam! What
wonders will you not accomplish in
a life time.

He makes a mock bow.

SIMS
Madame, you are to be
congratulated.

NELL
What do you want?

SIMS
I want only to reward you. Didn't
you ask for a separate sleeping
apartment?

NELL
I'd like  to sleep  in peace,.           
The main room is noisy at night.

SIMS
And I have a room for you --  a
prettier chamber --  if you will
come with me  --

Nell rises.



INT. CORRIDOR - ST. MARY'S OF BETHLEHEM - DAY

Two guards with cold chisels, hammers and bolt clippers are
snapping chains, the links of which come through holes in the
wall and are passed around a stone pillar in the corridor.



INT. TOM THE TIGER'S CAGE - DAY

Tom reacts in surprise as first one chain and then another
falls to the floor. He takes a great draught of air into his
lungs. He moves cautiously, feeling his freedom.  His eyes
move wildly.

INT.  MAIN ROOM - ST. MARY'S OF BETHLEHEM -  DAY

TRUCKING SHOT - Nell,  Sims and the  two guards behind them.

SIMS
Unfortunately, you will have to
share this comfortable apartment
with one other.  I'm sure you won't
mind that

NELL
Better one than a hundred.

ANOTHER ANGLE - to show Nell, Sims and the two guards
approaching the cage. Sims takes out a key,

SIMS
This is your new chamber, my dear
lady.

Inside the cage the gigantic maniac is beginning to move away
from the wall, still tremulous with his new freedom; his
movements hesitant.

CLOSE TWO SHOT - Nell and Sims.

SIMS
(with a gesture)
Won't you enter?

Nell looks at him.

NELL
You've not driven me mad yet, Sims.
I would not go in there.

SIMS
And I wanted so much to please you-

Nell starts to turn away. Sims catches hold of her elbow.

SIMS (CONT'D)
Wait.  This was to show you  that
all those mawkish theories you've
learned from the Quaker are lies. 
Men are not brothers  men are not
born kind and good  even the
mindless ones are savage and must
be ruled with force.

NELL
I know your thoughts on the matter,
Sims, they do not interest me.

SIMS
(disregarding this)
With the others, yes, you could
prove the little value of
gentleness  but look at this man --
look at him and tell me that kind
words and tender deeds can rule him
-- look!

He crushes her elbow in his hand to emphasize his point.

NELL 
I am looking   it proves nothing.

SIMS
But you don't dare enter the cage
with him -- that proves much --
that proves the falseness of all
that you have come to believe.

NELL It does not.

SIMS
Well, then, enter the cage, gentle
him with a word -- conquer him with
kindness -- or admit that your
Quaker lies.

Nell looks directly at him, then, firming her will, she takes
a step toward the door.

SIMS
(taunting)
You would enter.

Nell nods. He opens the door wide enough for her to pass
through. She hesitates, then steps slowly into the cage. Sims
clangs shut the door behind her..

INT. TOM THE TIGER'S CAGE - DAY

In his first astonishment Tom retreats from her. She stands
still, a pace within the door, and looks at him. He takes a
few steps toward her, almost as if impelled with animal
curiosity. He circles to one side, then hunches his great
shoulders. His whole body grows tense like that of some tiger
who stiffens before he leaps.

NELL
(quietly)
My friend, you do not wish to hurt
me, nor I you.

It is the first gentle word spoken to him in years Before
his madness can triumph over his surprise, Nell walks to a
small chair, catches up her skirts and seats herself.

NELL
Perhaps you would like to talk. I
will listen to you.

The gigantic maniac places himself before her and tries to
talk. Only inarticulate gasping sounds come from his mouth.
He gesticulates wildly. Then again he breaks into a frenzy of
gasping, disarticulated sound.

NELL
I know -- you are trying to
remember  some day you will. 

He is silent.

NELL
(comfortingly)
You will remember -- some day you
will remember.

She looks up at Sims.

CLOSE SHOT - Sims.    He shrugs and turns away leaving the 
cage  door unlocked behind him.

DISSOLVE

INT. JOHN LARD'S PUBLISHING HOUSE - DAY

Wilkes and his political supporters crowd the little
publishing house. Most of them are admiring a poster hanging
up on the wall which reads:
Your Votes, Poll and Interest are desired for
JOHN WILKES
Citizen and Joiner, to be
Chamberlain
He having more creditors than any other person.

A little away from this group stand John Wilkes, Hannay and
Varney.

VARNEY
 and the bailiff came. She went
with him to Bedlam.

WILKES
Apparently Sims fears an
investigation. Men have rid
themselves of unwanted wives by
that sweet expedient but it
takes Sims to forestall criticism
with imprisonment.

HANNAY
I will not believe such ill even of
him  but she is there.
I have spoken with her. She's as
sane as thee or me.

WILKES
Mistress Nell with that bright,
quick mind of hers -- saner than
either a politician or a Quaker. 
This is still England, Hannay, and
we have laws here  laws of right
and justice. I shall see that Sims
feels their full weight,

He pats the Quaker's shoulder.

WILKES
We'll have Nell out of Bedlam in a
twinkle -- never fear --

FADE OUT

FADE IN

INT. MAIN ROOM -. ST. MARK'S OF BETHLEHEM - NIGHT

FULL SHOT - Two maniacs are seated together on the floor. One
has a book in his hand, but from it he reads incongruous
verses.

FIRST MANIAC
Let Hull, house of Hull rejoice
with Subis a bird called the Spight
which, breaks the eagle's eggs. Let
Scroop, house of Scroop rejoice
with Fig-Wine-Palmi primarium
vinum. Not so - Palrai-primum is
the word. Let Hollingstead, house
of Hollingstead rejoice with
Sissitietaeris herb of good
fellowship. Praise the name of the
Lord September 1762.

While he reads the other maniac keeps shouting.

SECOND MANIAC
That's not right -- that's not
right -- that's not the word of
Truth -- the word of Truth is
peace.

With this last remark he tears the Bible from the other's
hand and the two begin to fight madly for its possession. In
the struggle the Bible is torn and its leaves scattered.

Nell, with Tom the Tiger following her, comes into the scene.

NELL 
Oh, Wallace  Edward  Stop!

She takes the Bible from them. Tom gets on his knees to pick
up the torn pages, handing them to her one by one.

SECOND MANIAC
We were fighting over the word
peace.

Nell grins.

NELL
Wiser men than you have fought
about it, Edward.

SIMS' VOICE
Mistress Bowen --

She turns. Sims comes into the scene attended by his two
warders.

SIMS 
 a word with you.

She steps quietly forward.

SIMS
I have good news.

ANOTHER ANGLE - showing that behind Sims and Nell is the
pillar near which Todd's desk is placed. Todd is busily
working and Long, as usual, is leaning against the desk,
thumbing his book of motion pictures.

SIMS
You are to have a new hearing
before the commission.

NELL
(eagerly)
When?                                                                         

SIMS
When it pleases the Commission.                                                

She starts to turn away very disappointed. Sims takes her
elbow.

SIMS
It will please them to have your
hearing tomorrow afternoon. I'm
delighted for your sake.                                                              

Nell gives him a quick, direct look.

SIMS
Indeed, I am so pleased -- you've
so endeared yourself to me -- that
I want to do everything possible to
make sure your hearing is a success
-- that you will be released --

NELL
(briefly)
Thank you.                                                                                                

SIMS
In fact, I have ordered our most
beneficient remedy for you.

At Nell's foot, Tom the Tiger reacts to this; begins to
crouch away. Nell puts her hand down, touches his shoulder
and quiets him.

TWO SHOT - Long and Todd. For the first time, Todd lays down
his pen and turns to listen. Long's face is a study in
frightened Interest.

MED. FULL SHOT - Sims, Nell, Long, Todd and Tom. Sims looks
around at Long and Todd, savoring their fright. Nell also
looks at them. What she sees in their faces puzzles her.

NELL
A remedy, Master Sims?

SIMS
Have they --
(pointing to Long and
Todd)
not told you?

Nell shakes her head.

SIMS
It is my own invention -- a cure --
a specific for the lax and
wandering mind.

He takes Tom's shoulder and moves him a little so that the
light falls on the kneeling maniac's face.

SIMS
Look at him. When he came here he
had but one concern -- to remember
something he had forgotten -- I
tried to help him with my remedy --

Sims sighs deeply.

SIMS
Perhaps I was not drastic enough.                                           

NELL                         
I need no cure.

SIMS
(shrugging)
Just to be sure, Mistress Bowen.

NELL
No.

SIMS
I've given you an invitation. Now I
must speak as your physician. Come
with me.

NELL
I'll take my chances with the                                                    
Commissioners.  I need no cure,

SIMS
As the Apothecary General of
Bedlam, I order you.

NELL
No!

SIMS
If you insist upon it, I must force
you.

He takes a step toward her.

NELL
Force me? Here? Look around you.

SIMS
(grinning)
Do you think your friends will help
you?

NELL
I have helped them.

SIMS
You expect them to band together
and overwhelm me. If they could
reason so, they would not be here.

He comes closer to her.                                                                                       

NELL
I warn you. They know me. They know
that I've helped them -- been kind
to them --

SIMS
(sneering)
And so they love you and will aid
you -- again that Quaker nonsense --

He comes right up to her and seizes her wrist. She pulls
back. For a moment they stand silently, pulling in opposite
directions, then his superior strength begins to tell and she
is forced to take a step toward him. From the darkness two
arms suddenly reach in and seize Sims. He drops Nell's wrist
and tries to yank himself free. A whole group of lunatics
crowd in upon him, grasping him with their hands. Nell backs
away from him, one hand restraining Tom.

SIMS
Let go of me.

LONG
(stepping to Nell's side)
Hold him.

SIMS
(shouting)
Warders -- help -- warders --

NELL
Shout away, Master Sims. Shout
away. Your men are used to Bedlam
and its noises -- they have heard
too many cries to pay attention to
one.

Sims sees the logic in her speech and keeps silent.

NELL                      
As for me, I'll just borrow your
keys, Master Sims.

She takes them from his hand.

LONG SHOT - As Nell, the keys in her hand, runs toward the
main door. Todd sees her and rises from his place at the desk
and goes quickly after her. At the main door he catches up to
her as she inserts the key into the lock.

TWO SHOT - Todd and Nell.

TODD
(as he lays a restraining
hand on Nell's wrist)
No  Mistress Bowen  not that way.
There's a warder in the hall                             
and another at the front door.                                  

NELL
But you heard him threaten me with
the treatment. I can't stay here.

TODD
There's a little window that is
left unbarred                                                       

NELL
I think I know that window, Master
Todd. You are mad if you think I'll
try to climb through that window as
Colby did, and others before him, I
dare say.

TODD
I'm not mad, Mistress Bowen  I'm
not like the others here. I've been
placed here, by my family to keep
me from drink - so that I may write
and support them. I know that
little window is dangerous --
designed for a death trap -- but
those who tried before were men of
small strength.

NELL
I'm no Hercules

TODD
Tom could lift you through that
window.

Nell considers this, the nods.

TODD
(pointing)
You can go through that door

They start off in that direction.

MED. PULL SHOT - Sims as he still struggles in the grasp of
his captors. He is addressing himself to Long who still
stands before him.

SIMS
Long  you've more reason than the
rest and I expect more from you 
you know that there are chains to
bind you and rods to beat out the
punishment you'll get for this. You
understand that don't you?

Long nods mutely.

SIMS
Then go to the door  call the
warders for me -- or else you'll
feel the weight of those chains and
the bite of the rods on your back.

Long hesitates.

SIMS
Do as I say.

LONG
(hesitating and  looking
around; frightened)
But the rest  what will they do to
me?

SIMS
Are you afraid of their vengeance?
They couldn't think far enough
ahead for that. They are lunatics.
They have been tried and found
incompetent by fair trial.

LONG
Trial? Quo Warranto  corpus
delicti  cum grano salis.

SIMS
Ah yes, I'd forgotten you were a
lawyer.

LONG
A lawyer, air? I am a Judge.
(in great excitement)
I am a judge 
(levelling his finger in
Sims' face)
I, the most skilled of them all 
and you shall be judged  judged I
say.

There is a general movement of excitement among the lunatics.
They move curiously forward; some grinning, some snickering
in excitement.

LONG
(pointing)
Bailiffs, hold that man! He
disturbs the court.

Three or four lunatics, including one of the women, fasten
themselves onto Sims' arms. A woman maniac begins to twitter,

WOMAN
Try him  try him,

MAN
A fair trial for Master Sims - a
fair trial 

Sims struggles in the grasp of his captors.

ANOTHER ANGLE -As Nell, followed by Tom and Todd, passes the
struggling group, Sims reaches out one hand to her and calls,

SIMS
Mistress Bowen  speak to them --
please speak to them -- I beseech
you.

Nell pauses, looks at him and then laughingly says.

NELL
Give Master Sims a fair trial.

She turns and with Tom following her, walks across to the
small door near the cage. She unlocks it and followed by Tom
disappears into the darkness of the corridor.

DISSOLVE



EXT.  THE ROOFS OF ST. MARY'S OF BETHLEHEM - NIGHT

CLOSE SHOT - Nell and Tom come out onto the window ledge.

NELL
(whispering)
Tom -- you must get up on the roof.
You are to go first, then you must
pull me up  up  you understand?

He nods, Nell throws open the window and gives him a little
pat on the shoulder. He starts to climb out.
Evidently, he has found a hand-hold above him as first his
head, then his torso and finally his legs disappear, Nell
edges out to the outer ledge of the window and lifts her hand
up,

NELL
(whispering)
Tom.

EXT.   THE ROOF GUTTER  - ST. MARY'S OF BETHLEHEM --  NIGHT

Tom kneeling in the gutter.    He has  one hand extended down
over the edge and this hand is wound tight around Nell's
upraised wrist.

NELL
Tom 

He starts to pull. She lets her feet slide off the window
ledge and is suspended above the street.

CLOSE SHOT - PROCESS - Tom and Nell.  The strain of pulling
Nell up brings Tom's head back so that he sees the stars
above him. He looks at the stars, forgetting all else. He has
forgotten about Nell. She swings suspended by only one hand
four stories above the hard cobbles of the street,

CLOSE SHOT - Nell.

NELL
(whispering)
Tom   Tom 

TWO SHOT -  Nell, frantic, but  still holding her voice to a
whisper.

NELL
Tom   Tom 

Suddenly,  comprehension dawns  on Tom's  face.    With a
great effort he pulls her up and she scrambles   safely onto 
the gutter.    She crouches there, breathing heavily, Tom
looks at the stars. Then she starts off over the roofs, 
leading Tom.

INT. MAIN HALL - ST. MARY'S OF BETHLEHEM HOSPITAL - NIGHT

LONG SHOT.    In the dimly lighted room pandemonium reigns
without let or license.    The insane patients, shouting in
excitement,  are in a great crowd about the pillar where Long
and Todd habitually stay.

Todd's desk has boon converted into a bar of justice and
behind it sits a stout lunatic with a dirty sheep's skin
spread over his head to Imitate a judge's wig. Behind him
stands a thin, sombre-looking idiot who makes exact splitting
motions in front of his face.

IDIOT
I am Solomon the Wise -- split him
in two -- split him in two.

A jury of twenty crazy men and women are herded together by
Don the Dog to the right of the desk. At the left, surrounded
by other lunatics, held by two crazy bailiffs is Master Sims.
Long, himself, is the crown advocate. Oliver Todd, the sanest
of them all, is evidently acting for the accused.

MED. FULL SHOT - Long.

LONG
(pointing an accusing
finger)
And so, Milords, we have brought
this man before you to answer for
those crimes  these crimes which I
shall number for you  neglect 

A great shout rises from the lunatics.

LONG 
-- cruelty -

Another yell that grows fiercer arises.

LONG
(as he continues more
rapidly)
 whippings  beatings  dirty
straw to lie upon 

Some of the lunatics dance around Sims, tearing off their
garments to show the marks from the lash; the bruises from
the club.

LONG
A great shout rises and above it
can be heard the clanking of the
chains from those still fastened to
the walls

LONG
Starvation -- stealing our food 
for all these crimes, Milords and
Gentlemen of the Jury, I ask
Justice.

A roar from the crowd follows. Sims tries to speak but his
words are drowned out by the shouting of the maniacs. They
swarm about him. Some pluck at his clothing with their
fingers. He goes down to his knees, the lunatics rain blows
on him.

CLOSE SHOT - Sims. His face is battered. He is shaken by the
blows and kicks of his charges. He tries to make himself
heard, pleading with outstretched arms and finally his words
can be heard.

SIMS
I beg you  let me speak  lot me
talk.

It is to no avail. They surge toward him again and again the
kicks and blows rain down.

DISSOLVE



INT. QUAKER MEETING HOUSE - NIGHT

After the hurly-burly shouting and screaming of Bedlam here
is perfect peace. The monotone of the Quaker costumes, the
orderly lines of the benches and the deep quiet with which
those simple people commune with God give a feeling of great
peace. Hannay sits at the end of one bench near the door.
Suddenly, that door bursts open and Nell stands there, wildly
disheveled by her flight, her eyes and face glowing with
excitement. She takes the few quick steps necessary to bring
her to Hannay's side.

NELL
William 

HANNAY
(whispering)
Shh. This is God's house.

NELL
(lowering her tone)
I broke free from Bedlam.

HANNAY
But thee should not have run from
there -- thee were to have a new
hearing tomorrow.

NELL
If I lived that long. He had some
treatment that he was to give me 
a treatment that made even the
maddest of them shudder to hear --
I ran --and they have him now.

HANNAY
Who has him?

NELL
The loonies  they've seized him
and are trying him in mockery--
they will kill him. It is what he
deserves.

HANNAY
Hush. Thee should not speak of any
man that way.  Have they killed
him?

NELL
They will  they will --

Hannay starts to rise and takes her arm.

HANNAY
Then thee must go to him. Thee must
speak to the poor afflicted ones
and save him.

NELL
Save him?

HANNAY
Can one know his mind? Can one know
what sickness lies in it? As thee
were kind to those in Bedlam, thee
must be kind to those whose
sickness forces them to hurt their
fellow man.

Nell hesitates.

HANNAY
Is it not the same thing? Has Sims
not a madness thee can pity?

Nell  thinks, then nods.

HANNAY
Come  -- we  shall get Wilkes   he
will help us  

He  starts to lead her from the Quaker Meeting House.

INT. ST. MARY'S OF BETHLEHEM HOSPITAL  - NIGHT

The rush lights have burned low and  only two portions of the
place are  well  illuminated; the pillar around which the
main group of  the  insane are gathered around Sims and the
other pillar where Dorothea,   the Dove stands in deep
quietude.

CLOSE THREE  SHOT   -  Sims as he faces Todd and Long. Behind
him is the  spectral figure  of Solomon.  Sims has been
pretty well battered.   His wig is gone. His face is dirty
and bruised.

SIMS
I did not want to hurt you. I did
not want to put chains                    
on you  to starve you  --to steal
from you.

LONG
But you did.  And now it  is our
turn.

SIMS
You  will  not dare harm me.
They'll load you with chains,
scourge you with the  cat. Then you 
shall really know what cruelty can
be.     I warn you.

TODD
Your vengeance is not our present
concern.  What you have done
concerns us -- why you did it.

SIMS
I  told you  --  I had  to  -- even
as you do things because you have
to do them -- even when you know 
they're wrong --

LONG
But  why?

SIMS
(still addressing himself  to Todd)
Can't you understand?    This  is a
great world and strong men with
great advantages rule over it and
men like me are frightened -- born
poor and misshapen 

TODD
Did you beat us out of fright Sims 
did you starve us out of fear?

SOLOMON
Split him in two.

The crowd moves forward, yelling. Long and Todd hold them
back with outstretched arms.  Sims cringes.

LONG
Is that why you still threaten us
if harm comes to you?

SIMS
(turning to him with a
snarl)
I warn you -- the chains - the
rods 

TODD
You spoke of your fear 

SIMS
It is a great world -- a world of
force and pomp and power -                              
and I was frightened at my
littleness - my ugliness and my
poverty.                                                               

TODD
And for that you struck and starved
-- 

SIMS
(desperately)
It is the frightened dog that bites
-- and I had to fawn and toady and
make a mock of myself so that all I
could hear was the world laughing
at my ugliness, I was afraid.

TODD
You had to strike us.

SIMS 
Yes -- yes -- can't you understand?

TODD
I understand.

SOLOMON
Split him in two.

LONG 
And our punishment 

SIMS
Let me go. There will be no
punishment.

TODD
He is sane.  There is a fear in him
 a fear that strikes out -- that
claws and tears at the world like a
singed cat. He is sane.

LONG
He will not punish us. He is sane.

JUDGE
This man is sane.

SOLOMON
Split him in two.

The crowd surges toward Sims, but Long interposes and
stretches out his arms to stop them,

LONG
Wait -- wait.

He is given a little space and a little quiet in which to
talk,

LONG
This man has been judged sane -- he
has no place here  he must leave --
you cannot harm him -- it is the
order of the court that he is sane
and that he shall be free.

The loonies nods their heads sagely. This seems a proper way
of settling the matter.

LONG
Bailiffs, release the prisoner!

The bailiffs let go of Sims. He can hardly believe that he
has been freed. He looks apprehensively about him, at the
faces of his charges and then begins cautiously, slowly to
back toward the door.

ANOTHER ANGLE - As Sims backs away his course brings him past
the pillar where Dorothea the Dove stands in her usual statue
like immobility. He starts to back away past her, moving
cautiously, keeping his eyes on the gaping lunatics who
follow him. As he comes close to Dorothea she puts her hand
into her bosom and draws forth the trowel. With a calm,
almost majestic movement, she plunges it into Sims' back.  He
falls to the floor, sprawling, and the lunatics crowding
about him hide him from view.

LOW CAMERA SETUP - Showing the loonies around Sims, They are
frightened at what they have done and begin to move away,
some furtively, some running.

LONG
They will punish  all of us.    The
Apothecary General is dead.

CLOSE SHOT  - Sims as he moves weakly.

LONG'S VOICE
We must hide him  somewhere we
must hide him --  so that they will
never know --

Many hands come into the shot and the body is lifted up.         

FULL, SHOT - A group of the loonies as they carry Sims
through the main hall.

MED. FULL SHOT - The door near Tom is cage. As the loonies
come up to it, Long takes a key from Sims' pocket, opens the
door and they pass through it.

DOLLY SHOT - As the lunatics carry Sims through the corridor
of the incurably insane, pandemonium reigns.

INT. THE INTERSECTION - ST. MARY'S OF BETHLEHEM - NIGHT

Here are the trowels, the mortar and the stones left by the
masons, as well as the unfinished wall. The lunatics cane
into the shot bearing the figure of Sims. With a great effort
they put him behind the wall, propping him up in an upright
position and silently with many a glance over their shoulders
they begin to wall him up. When the stones have reached his
chest his eyes open.
Almost as if frightened by this, the lunatics hasten,
throwing up the blocks of stone, slapping the mortar into
place. The wall rises above his head and he is blocked out.

DISSOLVE OUT

DISSOLVE  IN

INT.  THE MAIN HALL - ST. MARY'S  OF BETHLEHEM - DAY

Along the walls the  lunatics are lined- up.    There are
many warders watching them.  In the center of the hall,
walking toward the camera is a small group of people
including a warder,  the Chief Commissioner of Lunacy, 
another gentleman,  John Wilkes,  Hannay and Nell Bowen.

MED.  FULL SHOT  - The group.

NELL
(to Wilkes)
-- and when we got here, Master
Wilkes, he was gone.  Long said he
just left -- disappeared -

CHIEF COMMISSIONER
That is all I can get out of Long,
but I know they must                                                 
have killed him.                                                                  

DOLLY SHOT  - As the group advances toward the  little door
near Tom's cage.

CHIEF COMMISSIONER
But it's so preposterous, Master
Wilkes   a man like Sims doesn't
just disappear.                                                                   

The little party has reached the door and they pass through
it into the corridor. The warder leads the way with a lamp.                                                                                   

INT.  THE CORRIDOR  - DAY                                                                      

MED. FULL SHOT - As the party proceeds through the
intersection.    They come to the intersection and stand.   
Hannay crosses to the wall behind which Sims' body is buried.

WILKES
-  and that's  precisely why he
disappeared.     They tried him,
found him guilty of sanity and let
him go.   
Can you imagine what was in his
mind -- the mind of this man who
had sworn on all that was holy to
aid and comfort these people  -- 
can you imagine his feeling of
guilt?  I think that is what drove
him to run away.                                                                              

CHIEF COMMISSIONER
They killed him.

CLOSE SHOT - Hannay.  With professional interest he looks at
the masonry. It seems rough and badly done. He puts his hand
up and feels the mortar, then looks at his hand. His hand is
wet. He taps the wall. It is hallow. He turns as if to speak
to the others of his discovery, then pauses to listen as the
Chief Commissioner's voice drones on.

CHIEF COMMISSIONER
-- killed him and hid his body
somewhere --

WILKES
You can't prove  that without
finding his body.

CHIEF COMMISSIONER
.......We shall find it and we
shall punish them.

WILKES
Yes, I know - the chains -- the
beatings -- I tell you it's no
good. What you need here is a
better man to fill the post that
Sims has fled from  and after him
a better man and so on until things
here are as they should be; all
kindness and care for these poor
sick ones,

TWO SHOT - Nell watching Hannay as he listens to Wilkes. His
hand is still out-stretched and on his fingers the wet mortar
can be seen. As Wilkes finishes talking, she and Hannay
exchange glances.

ANOTHER ANGLE - Showing the group. The Commissioner and
Wilkes turn away and start down the corridor. Hannay starts
after them. Suddenly Nell throws herself in his way,

NELL 
You're not going to tell them.
You know what It means to the
people in there. Is it not worth
silence to save them suffering?                                              

HANNAY
I must tell the truth.

NELL 
But no one has asked you.

NELL
(looking at him with a                                                       
twinkle in her eye)
I have heard there was much
rejoicing in,Heaven for the lost
lamb that comes back to the fold.

HANNAY
Let me pass, Nell. I must tell
them.

NELL
With only a little silence you                                                   
can win a lost lamb for the                                                       
fold, Master Hannay. If you                                                    
speak you gain nothing but                                         
suffering for those in there.                                 

Hannay stands puzzled, shaking his head. His conscience seems
sorely tried.                                                                            

NELL
They have not asked thee.                                                                  
Thou hast no need to affirm and why
should thy hand be added to the
weight that those people in there
must bear. Is that God's Will?                                           

Hannay looks at her for a moment, then slowly grins.

HANNAY                                                   
Are we lovers that you thee and                                         
thou me?

Nell smiles back at him.

FADE OUT

THE END
