is one of the most controversial people in the United States of America. I have been friends with this gentleman on and off we're back on again

for least twenty years. I've known him- and this was a fun

cast, if you like God, damn it, I'm not listening this guy, give it a chance if you're, drunk or stoned, definitely give it a chance you're going to love it. I hope, if not a lot other pocket

still isn't. If, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Alex Jones,

the Joe Rogan experience

Alex Jones were live

wow it's going to be back for the second visit. It's good to be here. Man good see, see we

trump meeting with Kim Jong on we've got the

Cohen hearings in Congress. A lot of energy going on a things are happening: planets are aligned



we should tell everybody that you and I had with. First

we had a long conversation on the phone which led to just

a lot of talking you were driving to Vegas a few weeks ago. We took their own half and then we

side to do another podcast and we cleared the air on the phone.

We decide to clear the air more in a podcast there's a lot of things going on

I told you a long time ago that I would have you back on and in the interest

of being completely honest, there's I was

to do it not because I didn't want to talk to you, but because of just the amount of bullshit that I get from

able to get angry that you and I are friends. You know that give that guy a platform, that's

when will give that guy a platform, that's the big one. You know, but you- and I have always had a good time together- was that we've always had fun together are only problems have always been when we're not

like. If you're talking about me or if I'm talking about you not if we're talking to each other, it's the distance,



has been the promise to telephone. If lack of communication, the lack of communication has been a problem. The thing that people

upset about you, the thing that we wanted to talk about like quick to get it over with or not not quick, but just to get

up front up front. That's the best way to misrepresented. Yes, is the sandy hook's? Yes yeah, so your take on it just give me your take on it.

Well, first off because it's always misrepresented, I

mass shootings happen and they're real tragedies and, I believe part happened.

And you believe sandy hook up absolutely and now

last year the meeting

came out and said, Alex Jones has partly didn't happen.

And he sending people to parkland parents, houses

and there was no video, no audio wasn't true. I think I said I believe, parkland happen, so I'm not going to be

the mass shooting, the tile guy, I huh,



been branded as the sandy hook. I even imagine a final cut pro video editing timeline. You go back

almost seven years ago. This is more than seven years now,

Internet didn't believe some of things about sandy hook. I

covering it weeks after my first articles and things are all this will be used for gun control and I bet the guys on Prozac

a mental patient which he was

about two weeks into it, my listeners

and start sending me all these anomalies and things and later

some anomalies weren't accurate and I

just moved on from it. Okay

I mean I'm, not animal Anza, I didn't kill those kids, but when I'm on the

now people don't know. Adam Lanza is the guy that killed those kids. They think it's me,

actually, I believe you're not in prison, for what you did to sandy hook. All I know is:

call sandy hook, that kids show, but I don't think that's, I think the

majority of them are angry, because the narrative has been that you're sending people to the sandy hook, families host home.



Exactly and I know you'll, never have that you're responsible for these people getting harassed because you said on your radio show that it wasn't really. Yes, there is video and audio of me saying I can see how people don't think it happened, and I can see how people think it's synthetic is. There's been staged. Events before.

That then gets edited put together cobble together, but I never said go to people's houses. I never said go investigated, you ever say that you think it's not real. Yes, I did. But now you do think it's real

because I learned some of the anomalies were not accurate. That's a problem

him with all this conspiracy shit right because the conspiracy

free stuff, the people that want to believe they

Even conspiracies with everything- and I think, there's a certain percent- and we talked about this- just

a few minutes ago now, when I started getting accused four years ago, a couple

until then I should know. I think it happened.



And the people that I had interviewed and things sort of saying he's involved he's one of 'em, because you are now saying that it happened. They thought they had been compromised. Yes and then I really realizing, oh

work. A certain percentage of people are schizophrenic exactly and then they just think every

This is a thing about conspiracies it's very attractive to people that are schizophrenic, schizophrenic people think everything's, a fucking conspiracy from

at the bottom, every single interaction that people have some sort of a stage event that's trying to take them down or control.

All this or mind- control that that's a big factor in

A lot of this conspiracy theory shit is mental illness

when I started people come to the office saying that I'm

beau bridges or that I'm Jeff Bridges, or that I am I bill Hicks and people in restaurants screaming f. You bill,

we know it's you it's kind of like Dan, rather of

threatening me. What's the signal Dan, what's the signal? What I have experienced now, the quote: fame of being sued



famous being conspiracy guy. I was legitimately questioning things because of Gulf of Tonkin northward

things really happened: babies that weren't thrown in

guys there, Iraq WAR,

I kind of realize a few years ago that I kind of had my own mild psychosis,

and that when you been lied to by the media and the culture so much over and over again, everything then starts become.

Automatically you're sure it's fake and then everything you. She fits into that.

You get four or five years ago I began to realize, because I was on the receiving end of people pulling up in white vans with guns at my office saying I know you put a microchip in my head and I'm going to kill you

so it was kind of like once I got super famous. It was like whoa.

There's a certain percentage of people that are way off on the spectrum where they believe everything is fake and there's

believe everything they hear is true. I mean you should be

you should be questioning, you should have the right to do it, but but it's somewhere in the middle, and so

this one will see about sandy hook, I legitimately,

and it would people brought up anomalies. I then had debate,



but on both sides. The internet push me to keep

bring. I probably covered it twenty times in the first

here's. What happened

and then, as soon as I questioned it not being staged, I got a so much that I said screw it mass shootings happen. I believe it happened, but then

media would call me or interview me and say: ok

tell us the anomalies of why you questioned they were gay,

ing me to say it again have right to question it but

they thought well, how shows versus dead kids Alex Jones and I AL shows arrested families. This is a perfect way to get this guy, who so popular get people to question to get people to think this would

years. I think I'm smart, I'm not to figure out what's going on so when Hillary, a few months before the election, gives us huge

says Alex Jones has a dark heart.

He knows sandy hook, kids died, but he says they didn't.

He sends people their houses he's the worst guy in the world. I came

I said: listen, I never



anybody the houses, but I apologize was taken out of context people the right to question, but I

sorry for the families and I'm sorry for hurt and I get it

experience crazy people now, big time. Just like you have

Please stop saying

I'm saying it didn't happen, please

stop saying: I'm sending people whose house is what happens when they put it on

every major tv channel local tv channels, radio, I mean I mean thousands of articles that then gets indicated a van. If I said one hundred thousand articles that slow number, though,

amount of sandy hook. Coverage against me has

then show insane so huge because it supposed to be the first domino that once I'm taking down, then all the dominoes fall. Well, it's also click bait. There's

also a thing. If you say Alex Jones Sandy Hook and you put in a title a certain amount of people just going to click on it Alex Jones '

is still pushing a sandy hook. Conspiracy theories, one that I saw just two days ago. Exactly

the point I've gotten to is here's the key.



They then they say more people are showing up in Connecticut, more people are coming their houses, which they are

Does the media is all over the news saying there's a big conspiracy here Alex Jones.

'cause, it doesn't happen, and so people then hear it

they think. Oh, you know it's like

looking for the Mossman or something they're all running up there in the media, saying in my name and I'm saying no, I believe it happened years ago and so then,

I'm getting the blame in the attacks in the demonization of the threats for what the

print media is saying over and over again that I'm saying that it didn't happen and the families are getting the threats and the families are getting in tax and the families are getting called crisis actors.

Yes, something different, oh my god in hindsight.

Absolutely but again I legitimately

powerful as it was.

I wasn't retrospectively looking everything I was doing as much as I should nobody's perfect as you,



the older you grow when you learn things, but I just began to realize about three years ago that

making my identity not being a national is not being a populist not being a free market guy there making

whole identity sandy hook and the

we're going to assume it end. Well, it's just because that's what gets clicks yes, but then, but then before I ever got sued

I said I believe sandy hook happen. That's not not my I I barely ever covered stop right. You

and that's not what they're doing they're not trying to make this weakness admit even worse, but they're not trying to make your identity they're not trying to define.

Do or do some sort of a documentary, a biography on your life there,

finding something that people want to pay attention to. This

are the problems with the news coverage today is that they find things that people want to pay it

into and they focus on them out of proportion it

three when they say that I

making money off sandy hook when, when the newspapers in the publishing houses

using me as a way to put out



that in cinerary. Hurtful thing: well, it's also going to be hurtful. I didn't mean to be in January, I was legitimately questioning. Is the internet was asking a bunch of other state stuff and then I say: hey take it back, don't do it and then

Oh no! We're going to commit this hurtful thing. That's for kill, free speech, but is hurtful in your freaking name, and

and that's. Why I'm not saying I'm the victim here, I'm saying: stop it because everything they do about the Platte

maybe the biggest frustration is. I still have my huge audience and radio stations in floor

news wars, dot com but reaching

people's very hard and then now

I've been silenced, the mainstream media can say whatever they want. Joe about you about me, and I can't respond. I mean you go to Youtube and type in Alex channels. Well, this is where you another negative stuff and there's one that says: White Supremacy and Alex Jones, and you click on

it's a famous british actor and author saying, Alex Jones, says: kill the

family.

Of of parkland parents and



we have lawyers getting ready to fall sued over this? I warn the guy sent letters he didn't take it out. I have to you, could pull up his famous projector forget to send

Youtube, all the main stuff

up on top. It's like the seventh eighth

this is Alex Jones and White supremacy. What to do about it and he says: Alex Jones

White Supremacist are saying:

go to the people's houses at parkland and kill the parents, and we have to take

the air base killed. The parents, there's no free speech for killing parents and I'm like dude.

Do not say that I'm going to get killed.

I am never said. Nobody now department, I sure, as hell didn't say, kill their parents let's. Let's so now can let's take the setting stuff. You know about fake news. They have green lighted, making anything

You can imagine up about me and it

like insane

and that's all I'm saying Is- is that

at a certain point, it's like Jesus. I get let's, let's take this step by step. I'm sorry,

it's ok! This invisible is. We want to give you



opportunity to communicate and

clear the air and talk and some of the shit that you

I talked about earlier. There's a bunch of things going on one there's: it's a story that attracts people's attention.

Right a story of a guy who saying that people didn't get killed when they did get killed, and it's horrific for people to look at it's horrific to people

about their own children will not only get murdered, but then someone would accuse them of being a crisis actor. So then they

pushing that story and that story becomes

thing that they make money off of which is really

and in some ways, kind of ironic. They keep this store

three in the news and they keep getting clicks off of you and

representing some of the things that you said yes

and some of the things that you said you wish you

and said to like. That's that's also real, but but I mean let's be clear,



not even defending myself people learn stuff, as you get older hindsight, you're like. Why did I do that? Like I used whatever? Was

big hot thing, on the internet, I would just debate because it was

interesting with this. What I wanted to get to you

you were doing this show and in this show, you're on the air hours and hours a day and you're

thing about all these. Various things is this:

is it fair to say that you weren't really one hundred percent aware of what kind of influence you were having? Absolutely if you,

did know you would a phrase things differently and done things differently. You know it's

even beyond that I was just younger and- and I was covering what

other people were saying. I was not the first, the tent, the hundred the ten thousand you

about it on the internet was a firestorm all over the news that people are denying it and I've got

was going hey, look at this video, but isn't it the problem with every single national tragedy? Anytime, something happens,

there's a certain amount of people that think that there's a conspiracy even



it's just a plane crash, even when it's just what the

thanks any sort of national. Exactly at all, I'm saying is

sandy hooks, not the hill on dying on. I I support people's right to question

and I understand, because there's been so much lying and corporate media and by governments and staged events that are admitted into classified that once people see that one thing was staged

then everything else must be staged, and then I-

been on the receiving end of

early. Thousands of made up conspiracies, which you laugh at until people on a truck with gun, show up yeah

and so I understand part of this- is

complex world. We live in all the information we have more than ever, and a lot of it is all the drugs people are on

a lot of it schizophrenics. This is a big problem, a big green

We were talking about this certain percentage of the beings. Half of Brazil has



raise arm to make she basically psychotic. Well, it doesn't make you psychology to risk. Taking crazy affects your judgment. This is toxic programs, you don't have more cats smell p S, yes it well, it definitely does that to to rats it actually re programs, rats brains, makes them sexually

and there's a bunch of parasites.

Each of them to some the probably haven't even been identified. That's where the whole crazy cat. Ladies and come from yes, that's exactly this, it's one of the reasons why they tell women when they're pregnant to stay the fuck away from cat litter. Don't touch cat litter, don't cats! Yes, you cats! Yes, you mean it can be actually fatal for babies, but the

China, King Middle, when they said, kill the damn cash. Well, I'm sure there's a lot of factors there right see

Wives tales were like you get demon possessed,

that cat and really it's a

membrane warm, but that's probably also why they told you that that's a real brain worm programming, like you were saying earlier, I looked at screw. I don't know that that the top soccer's teams have the highest level of brain worm infestation. Well, it's there's a disproportionate amount of people that live in.



Trees were the high toxoplasmosis infection with successful soccer teams. There was some stuff.

That was done on that, where we had a doctor, women that women more sexually promiscuous more they just yes, it's recklessness yes and they think the men are more reckless and that's why there's a disproportionate amount of motorcycle victims that test positive for toxoplasma

This is with Robert Sapolsky out of Stanford University was telling. Is there a way to removed? I don't think through right. Warm! I don't think there is.

Well, you know, there's like snails that get a brain warm that programs to the top of the tree

birds, eat it and then, and then it's crapped out and the snails eat that and then go and it's just food cycle. Yes, yes, so how don't tell me in classic evolution- and I also believe interpretation by by Right- wingers of

the bible- is not what it says, but I

solution? Answer big quick jumps, but we know what's going on, but the idea



just there's the worms and there's all these different. Well, what about the one that gets into a grasshopper through the aquatic worm gets inside of a grasshoppers body and gets the grasshopper to commit suicide, gets a grasshopper to jump into

water and drown, and then it comes out of its body and that's where it

it lives. It lives in the water, so it literally gets its

to commit. So how did that chain of events? How does that evolve? Where suddenly a worm gets in a grasshopper and

something a supercomputer couldn't do it be programs to drowned it.

Well, this is a matter of complex biology means, I think

it's insanely complex and that's something that science

lists, are studying on a daily basis to ensure that coming want to talk about me all day,

We are here to do it and I- and I know I don't have a talking point- I don't have a pr firm, yeah we've a top.

Before we don't here about what am I gonna Thio? What do you want to say today? So you could help me get it out. I don't

I'm alive, I want to say a bunch of things. I'm only learning how this works being



the process of it. It's giving me a much bigger view that,

three years ago, when I first got on here

because I've experienced what other

People have sent the bad things I did experience. I did it from a good heart. I believe question was okay. I was

other people questioning, but then

weird sick, irony

in the media that says that I'm the

on the rated sandy hook didn't happen. When I wasn't too, then in my name, popular

is it to a level of like they put.

Is key. Then, before you invade a major country, I mean this

been going on for years every day. The news, the print no

died at sandy hook. Outshone says Alex Jones has go to their houses and hurt them what the hell's it for it goes on and on and on and on what you're thinking this, because it's about you so because it's about you



becomes a primary point of focus because it's affecting your life and it's something you're concentrating on, but the volume is massive it is. Volume is massive because it's something that generates interest. This is part of the problem with the way

do news today. Anything that

rates. Interest I mean if the

if the media really cared, they probably

have would have never talked about it

never brought it up that we had real terror attacks in the sixties and seventies that weren't staged you go back and look at him,

the weatherman and all that stuff and the government. The media didn't cover it well. This is a long time ago.

But but but but they didn't cover because it gives. If you cover terrorists, they do it more right. That's true! I was agreeing with you yeah, okay, that's true

It's like in other countries, they don't print the name of mass

shooters in the newspaper 'cause. They don't want people to get attention for that.

Some, all I wanna say, is Joe. I genuinely I've known you twenty years or since, like one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight ninety nine

I genuinely really in trying to find the truth and



I realized that once I saw a bunch of the classified staged, events like north

like are or gladio or light Gulf of Alpha Tonkin or

small it I mean I couldn't help it. I do he probably assuming the day after it happened,

I said the guy's got a noose around his neck at two, a dot m and

ha go and fuck has a noose in Chicago who's, walking around with the news who even knows how to write. Who knows how to make a noose.

And the cops show up. Forty,

minutes later he's like the door with a noose around his neck yeah, I mean subway tile said it's fake, but that's it I'm sitting there I said Sumi destroy me, my it's fake. I can't help it but see. The problem is that the psychosis comes in because, if you're a little kid is I've been read more about Psycho,

try to understand this stuff, if you're a little kid and

somebody with red, hair beach, you and tortured you a check out man with red hair job title, what we're gonna not like guys around here, so so so it's kind of like or if you would like to



is a kid letter that creates mental illness later right. So we've been locked with the media in the corporate system and seen all these fake hoax is and the fake stuff about cabin. On the face of the coverage of kids and the face of

small it. She that's now the public. Actually, here's what happened, I'm getting huge backlash and small. It's not it's, not women. Who

given you back last letters and the public are like hey small, it's fake, the Covington,

these fake bhalaji, four,

mostly women, said it was all fake. So why are you saying Sandy

looks real everything's fake. It's like no dude everything's, not think that's. What I'm saying is that

torrential is gone and

so yeah there's a bunch of fake stuff, and we have a right to question it, but now now then now the general

put my fans believe everything straight. But let me stop you there, I'm ranting, I just it's. Ok, I want you to rent this, but this is. This is the nature of the beast. This is

but you're selling to a lot of these people. This is why they're tuning into you, they want to hear you uncover conspiracies, and some of them



aren't as bright as others, and some of them can't see logic. They don't see it, they don't understand, I'm legitimately questioning. I don't just think everything. I know you don't listen. I think. If you never talked about sandy hook, you have no problems. I really do believe that I believe there would be proud

times I think people would look down on you and call you a right wing lunatic and all sorts of other things which they

even know when I knew you when I first knew you you were getting arrested for going after George Bush. I remember when

but you are not a right wing system, a question here as well. You were asking him a pertinent question about the CFR and his dad's drug. Yes, exactly exactly, and this was it,

that was running for president as a Repub,

can getting you were I brought up IRAN Contra the CFR. My point: is you weren't you weren't tide to to a party? You were

to find the truth, and I only pray that when I align aligned with Trump that's when all hell broke, loose, yeah yeah, that was part

I think that was Hillary admits she looked at.



Whole Bio said sandy hook hit him on that right now. Do you still communicate with Trump? Not in a while?

I have a shot, it becomes a big issue, I mean I obviously make it was sir gets to be able to talk to Trump. I mean Don Junior was on tackles last night or talking about me him saying what happened is wrong in the fact that they've used

we as the way to start the casual society and then and then imagine there

supposed to block somebody from banking and they have a good record. It's not fraud. Here's a whole other story. I had an a plus plus rating with my shopping, cart and bank accounts. I had for twenty two years and

banks, looked at it and said: we've quite frankly, never seen anybody with a credit rating. This high 'cause, you never even do chargebacks with our shopping cart,

we'll. Do that? What does mean chargebacks point? Is we have the best credit to rest? Okay, a group out of Boston

which I'm not going to mention here for your show and things, but we're preparing litigation against who does the rate



it's a secret rating system for like Talib,

Al Qaeda, the mafia. That's that's! Given the bank executives two days before Paypal, bandits, they put a hate, does

patient from the southern Poverty LAW Center Shane, I'm basically a terrorist

So when I call you I hate person now it means a terrorist in Interpol, so all over

western world

and we've been sent documents out of England and out of the U S.

That we were sent this by high level banking people that have worked out. We make contacts, lawyers check that they can't believe it. They have

designated me is an international terrorist and that's how they took five of my six bank accounts and got me down to one bank account with

Trick Credit Shang. You cannot take money on your shopping, cart,

infowarstore dot com for Prada

which T shirts books whatever you.

You aren't allowed to be in commerce because you are a terrorist and what do they use to define terrorist h,

It's classified symbols and we got some of the docking pages hate ages, hate



and just so, they just decide arbitrarily that you're, a hateful person that you promote hate, no judge, no jury. It's the global chinese social score, that's what they're! All!

sing for here, but this is what we're talking about this very important. This is actually dangerous. This is

really dangerous to give people the ability to define people without any strict, rigid qualifications? Without anything, you can point to

If I was a convicted murderer and got out of prison. I started on.

Stores, sell, T shirts

that was Charlie Manson. He hit like four tv specials on on on CBS on sixty

I was a kid I watched, Charlie Manson. I don't think he was allowed to get paid for those, though I think that was part of the thing because of his

sure they have laws on that. But the point is: would do her all the river shows. The point is Hitler

Basically was the number one thing on the history channel when they first launched it, so you can hear what Hitler has to say, even though we

he's a bad guy. Well, why can't your Alex Jones has to say because

they have found what I talk about is effective. It gets people thinking and they want to

shut down because we've we've re launch



Populism enforces done this. My audience has seventeen

the six worldwide populism.

Globalism Anti communism, Anti China and the big tech companies, Google and

Apple, and all of them have publicly moved to China and they publicly agree

The sensor and control the populations in the nose and that's why TIM Cook got so mad

me and I made a huge issue to Trump and I sent reports the President. I know he got and that's what happened.

On that Sunday night when they said. That's it we're Donald Jones. We have to take him down because I got investigations going

at the national security level, sending big reports the President through law, firms of Reuters and

AP, and then the articles which he wasn't getting.

China has given the code keys by apple this last year and

is moving their database there. All the code keys have been given to the chinese government and apple says.

Just part of being there and Google's building dragon fly.

Help since the entire population with the social,



the scores are already. Testing in Venezuela with China

bring it here and everything you do live time will be controlled and all the

Airlines now are putting cameras in that watch you, while you're in there. You think. Let me stop you because you rent and again I am ranting. It's ok. You

think they're using sandy hook as an excuse to get you off the

and the sensor you and to take away your ability to make income not because of that, but using that as an excuse because of the other things you do like targeting things like Google and talking about

things that you're talking about where they're in China and China's allow their allowing China to censor the population, I'm just telling I'm not against Google or apple, they did a lot of cool things. I'm saying stop it

I told you ten years ago you were built here in the? U, with DARPA money, don't go help. China

This stuff don't be evil. Well, I only take something because I I knew someone who worked at Google. I know someone who used to work at Google. I should say their thought process was that Google is going if they don't.

Bring Google to China in a censored form they're going to copy Google.



This is the real. The real worry, because China copies everything I mean there.

Intellectual copyright, but there gonna steal it better now, true, but it. But this is what they're saying what was it about that job, but did

Let me let me explain something from the point of view of Google as a business, and I don't

is I'm not saying. I agree with this because I don't wish more apple juice, get some apple juice in your system, fella. They they thing

king and this is what I was talking to a woman who was a very high level executive and she was saying that they're going to steal it. If we don't work with them,

they're, just going to steal, Google and and take the code and make their own version of it. So then

as a business. There like this is inevitable they're going to do it anyway, we're just going to give in

to their censorship demands. I don't agree with

I don't think it's a good idea, but I don't know what I would do. If I was Google I'll tell him you'll tell what I'll tell the little tissue. What should they Dio for China, your dad on what that person told you



when I had the globalist fifteen years ago, twenty years ago, trying to buy me off ten million a year. You know whatever, by the way cheers here, cheers brother anyway, when they did all that.

When I get all that. What were they trying to do who's trying to buy a lot? Well, I can't get into a private meetings. It's it's journalist of all record, but you, your body, gets this offers like Alex you're gonna him

those things by being on the inside, if you don't, join this and help save the planet and do all these big things might have got the same speech when he was in high school already. Ut had planned to tell you about that. What, if that later? But if you don't join us in the

bad guys there in the system are going to win, that's how they cooperate. 'cause, that's how those people you're talking to.

Pretty good person that person at Google they've had hundreds of their top engineers quit

over this, because here's the thing China in

one thousand nine hundred and forty nine- was nationalist and and



capitalist and our own cis, but declassified left us the Ford Foundation. That's above the CIA helped put the chai comes in power. It took

some decades to get running water in toilets. They have

environmental standards, no rules that had all of our investment they've been built up because

the chinese commies will do it over the global swine.

You go and you are in China. They make

you become state, run to get zero percent tax corporate. Ok, so I tried to lower ours, just be competitive,

China has zero percent corporate tax. Look it up now. If you become state sponsored state run

show they're claiming oh,

us of our technology, we're to go,

over there and spread our legs to him even more. So it's not a

people were willing and we're willing to take you along with us. So the idea that well, if we don't give it

so they're just gonna rip it off. So let

go really give him all the big secrets and and have Google last your till the Pentagon



going to help you with a autonomous drones, but Google Gay

them all. The latest aye ai.

And I'm getting more sophisticated stuff in a moment,

gave them all the sophisticated, a I and

China announces they've got all these drones that are autonomous and all these ai Ai Weapons systems director aircraft, so

what I'm telling you is China.

Has no rules. Twenty

ago they had cows that produce human milk. Twenty years ago

had spiders that british body armor spider guts

they have human animal hybrids. Thirty years ago, they've got giant. Human tissue farms

You know you hear. Oh, your Achilles is torn. We've got,

grown. A lab attendant is not a frickin tenant grown a lab. It's uh

Fricking deal humanoid, these aren't human.

The way they get around it is they made me went with that we're seeing saying so many things. This is listen. I love you to death.

You said that you know million dollar shipping which are real. I believe they are

you say so many different things without stopping it's hard



reporting to the government agency, so they'll listen, investigate Md Compartmentalized,

but will be studied for years. So

Well, I Jo Jo, JO, JO, yes Joe. It was in

my key quarterly. Twenty five years ago they had human animal embryos what they killed with the embryonic level. I believe they've got humanoids. I believe this I've been they look. They ever do use crisper to enhance children with higher intelligence. R S and Sharma was actually was a side effect. They believe a h. I it was something about HIV immune to HIV show yes,

I roll that is already been tested,

but it has a name

what's really going on, they have

call breakaway civilization

some of the regular civilization without sandy hook, which I get. I appreciate. Let me cover

and I'm sorry I never happened. I believe that happen. I'm sorry for people's pain, and

I ask



the families, and I asked the the lawyers. I asked them all stop at my name, saying on the wolf at the door: Shango

for these families and

running around to the news everywhere saying Al

Jones has Sandy hook didn't happen, be

the media about the media is the most unpopular thing in the world with seven.

Approval rating in Gallup. So when they say

I say it's fake that sin's people

to Connecticut, because people think the media lies. So if they're saying Alex Jones said didn't happen, it must have not happened and now they're trying to create a violent event, not the families.

I think some of the people involved know that if they make a big enough hype about it, they're going to have a big event:

up there in Connecticut, understand and they're gonna blame it on me. So I'm saying no! No! No!

I believe it happened

saying I said it didn't happen and stop saying that I'm saying no kids died because I want to talk

about human, animal hybrids and humanoids because Joe, why is it got to be a humanoid? Why? Because, if you make

A few percentage points another Anna,



or another creature.

It's a gray area. There's no human rights. You have an animal rights movement, you have a human rights movement. There's no alien movement aliens are real they're creating.

Human animal hybrids- that are a new creature- never here on earth, it's alien,

so the aliens are already here. I is alien.

The chimeras are alien, alien

they're already here so you're, saying they're, making these human animal hybrid. So they can what harvest tissue from them

just level one was level two what's level eight, because

I'll tell you a lot for the best

knowledge, a lot of people. Think: oh, it's! It's

Leman! Harvesting! Ah fall!

Are these Buddhist really healthy? That's big!

That's going on because they still have a

better non rejection rate, but with the eras

I remember twenty two years ago, reading

BBC article that was

testing the waters occasionally tested, and I go

about fifteen years ago, the first



the animal human come

test if they're not brought to term, but some

I just want to plant them in utero own cows, because

as a bigger uterus. You grow bigger, humanoid and get more tissue, and so then I went

I better go research that so I went to Ut Library. At that time you could get some of the internet like one thousand nine hundred and ninety six. I wouldn't actually pulled up all these m. I t reports talking to my dad other people who was a doctor

and they go yeah. That's really crazy and it

all about how we've got to prepare the public.

For this, because we're going to be able to download their memories and then put it in

This is before blade runner so

not like this is the world's on imitating blade runner, blade. Runner is

preparation for what's coming and there too

more human than human. This is going to be more advanced. This is going to be better, but like everything like a cell phone or like a vaccine



it's got a Trojan horse. It's got a back door, it's already been tested, it's already been perfected, it's being rolled out you're, not given the real technology you're, not given the real life extension you're, given the crap Joe and the earth is seen as like an egg yolk to give the proposed

in power for this new thing, that's going to be born

and whether you believe it or not, just like when the new thing, meaning artificial intelligence, beyond that, it's a fusion of artificial intelligence and a whole

synthesis of new life forms, and so

text, big giant race. When he almost came in and told you 'cause, he goes he's billionaire functions and he has a conscience so he's freaked out and they go these billions

functions. I don't just know this. I've talked to people, and I was in wired, Mag,

sing twenty something years ago. Why the future doesn't need his bill? Joy, a billion,

CO owner, said: Microsystems

list of billionaires billionaire meeting with two hundred guys and the consensus was we're going to play video games

party all day, we're going to set up a world government we're to slowly type

take the employees in the the public him down, put it

magnetic radiation out with five g, the scrambles their dna lowers your iq. We're were



smash mental illness in a controlled societal collapse that will then

organized and controlled in the mop up crew by robots controlled by

the globalist programmers who believe with the off world entities there in communication with

that they're going to be given the operation to upload and be in that larger kind of bored cube

system. Okay, if they sell the country country, got hit the brakes brakes 'cause. We need to take this back to I'm so baffled. What's matter with one of these things,

MIT Technology review estimates at about twenty pregnancies of pig, human or sheep human chimeras have been established during the last twelve months in the US total whitelist in twenty sixteen hundred percent. Believe it look,

I think that this was going on in nineteen. Eighty five, I'm sure they tried to recruit my dad to a DARPA program Bible

in college, and then he was a dentist. I believe that I believe that they will take all sorts of Lib

he's in great scientists, scientific research I def



we did you ever see, trending implausible shattering again, but let's, let's start slow because you, you know you get over two hundred different factors in bombs, trying to ignite the atmosphere. Yes in the nineteen sixties. No, I know that the Us Airforce tried to destroy the atmosphere in nineteen. Sixty eight, yes, operation, starfish prime,

they actually detonated a nuclear bomb they adopted.

In a nuclear bomb in the upper trying to blow up the radon radiation. Yes, they've done a lot of goofy shit. See that's the thing, that's why I got mad at you and I love you and you're smart guy and everything is, I know, go listen. You got mad because we didn't communicate all this stuff. I know you're even better. It's saying it and then use

you can't handle it and you said it's not going to go now. It's not that I can handle it's these two factors, one! I don't have it any time. I don't have enough time to

go into it as much as you do us wiped out. I thought I got mad at you. That's it right there you every time I bring up a

can subject. You know all about it. I don't know



You fucking know all about this shit hole a smart guy, Lee Side, people who hype Gnosis, dumb joke

this is a pot bullshit. You know exactly

What should I don't think: you're a bad guy, you're trying to survive for you and your family and do good? Ok, but you know not a family, your family, none of us are going to make it there's a post here.

Error. Coming the breakaway civilization the deal's been made, it's not it

not! The third dimension. They've made frickin deals with interdimensional aliens and notice the media never test for that. 'cause! That's the truth. Maybe this is true. I do not know this and they get into it.

I do not know this, and even these human pig

hybrids, Jamie, just pull this.

I believe it's true. I mean I'm worried about human paying high bridge. I'm sorry, the Sandy Hill kids died. My identity is not that I get it. They admit five

G and all the studies Latimes Times causes massive mutation and cancer. Wait a minute literally rattles your dna apart, all of our



under attack. You mean five minutes drop for allowing five to come in. This is the new internet. You know what they will China put in Wapo.

You know Farjeon Major, that's the big chinese

fire today, no you're on fine, no, the five g you're on fire, okay,

Bbc article in ninety six about human animal hybrids with pigs and cows. Yes, you gotta make

Our cows of the cow keeps you doesn't reject it or part, pick: okay,

fan and that you know about pigs and rats.

Most closely related to get rejected. You know about that. Yes, pigs.

Very close to humans, even use PIG

organs and people usually do everything show no it's true.

You know in a general knowledge, you know everything I know. No! No! No! I don't listen on italian those little. We know what they're doing so

Just like they say just like they say.

Oh yeah, we had human animal hybrids. This is like freaking, thirty nine.



Years ago. Now, twenty three years ago, I'm reading in the BBC about it and go confirm a test. Ok and they're. Just floating

There was an article in nineteen ninety nine in the Baltimore Sun

No, I a blow you away. Who is his dad was a US congressman got killed his brother US senator he,

he should have on the show, the guys that got all the money. Given a native americans- and you spell his last name bag. It's it's it's a good friend of mine. Can I get him on

frequent will fly right now, anyway. The point is so. What does he do? He

was telling me all these years ago. He goes Alex. It isn't chemicals in the food.

Water, that's Charles lost baggage, checked it Jim, it's electrochemical, electrochemical!

but I'm reading in the Baltimore Sun after I just had

I thought it was crazy, is giving all these patents for mind, control using wave links in microwaves and I'm sick.

We're looking at it and I'm reading it and I'm seeing it.



The Baltimore Sun says the CIA is testing on cell towers, wave links to calm the public during crises. I just had baggage on with patents. Talking about that, what baggage explains his?

It's, not that the microwaves have somehow interface with the brain. We all

the interface with the space wins all these other magnetic fields. Everything else show there

will just testing this stuff and so everything they deploy. They've got all these other technologies. My dad was at UT and sixty five,

was in high school already had cd roms computers, everything,

but they had a nuclear reactor underneath the building would put that album

oh absolutely, that's what I'm telling you

breakaway civilization, dude. We don't know what they've got we don't know.

We don't know who we don't know the whole thing.

I'm telling you is. This is hiding in plain view and that's why?

If you knew all this you're trying you're trying to tell people go? Oh, oh,

he's doing that find one thing he did. That sounds mean and make that his whole world,

I'm telling you is it's been in the newspaper



the cell towers, are being used for my control. That sounds like a schizophrenic. So see here,

I want to see that. How do they use the cell towers? Will probably look here's the thing. Here's the deal right here. You gotta total schizophrenic. That thing

the sun is following around town and thinks their dog

watching him and works for the aliens. That's not happening. You've got someone over here, someone over here the believes everything they see on Fox, yes, okay, yes, now

She is good. Science is good, trying to figure out what's real and all of us get freaked out the nature of the world. No one knows what the universe is. We don't have all the answers, so it kind of people can't handle that bigness. They can't handle that question especially low iq, so they had

differentiate and create a model that allows

to put it in boxes, so they can make it make sense because they can't handle it, like. I, like I say, even top astronaut space walk for the first time and they're out in the universe and the whole planet, Sun room, and what are they going to do that? It's it's my ball!



Well, imagine once you realize we don't know everything we don't.

Stand in its endless and there's all this crazy crap people go nuts and his humans learn more and more, as we become more advanced into this metamorphosis, it's going to create a

giant societal crisis. Where most the people already going to get killed the

humblest understand that in the birth of this planet, this new species and so

they decided to take control, making scientific stun everyone and dumb down. So they could scientifically try to orderly Kerry this operation. But then I go wait. A minute you're dead

over one hundred hydrogen hundred bombs, the upper atmosphere to see if you could ignite the atmosphere, destroy the earth yeah, but that was in the sixties. I know, but what I'm telling you is

The same professors trained people right, but those people are dead. The people that detonated those hydrogen bombs in the 60s they're dead now

does not we're not dealing with the same human beings.

With you. I know people in a lot of ways are more immoral. Now I think I agree with you in some ways that everything evolves and things get better. This is one of my arguments about operation, Northwoods that if they were able to



operation Northwoods and get it signed by the Joint Chiefs of staff in nineteen sixty two was it sixty two

if they were able to do that

and no one went to jail and no one got arrested for proposing that they were gonna arm cuban friendlies and have them bomb Guantanamo Bay and blow up which a cuban jetliner and and and and shoot people who is it? Yes, that's cool! Yes, this things evolve, things evolve and if unchecked-

and obviously that was unchecked, no one went to jail.

That no one, you know even PBS covered it like. I never even knew this. Let's read this one here: the significance of the

research he explained is that, although the cell phone power is low, electromagnetic radiation can nevertheless have an effect on.

Intell behavior

transmitting at the proper frequency? What is this article? Jamie, scientific, american and scientific american ads titled, mind controlled by cell phone, so

Who really does have an effect. They did a whole stuff, but let's go further, it does it. So there is. So what do you think



they're making this node maybe classified last year,

thirty, seven page CIA manual from the nineteen seventies, when they were putting up cell towers, that

like trees already test,

sing in neighborhoods? Ok, did you show your shit? Can I shut my phone track shoe

catches you and controls you and surveilled you. You think that it's one way, but you

that it's a microwave relay system?

They can manipulate and then

towers, even more powerful. So this is a device

given to us by the gods

okay given to us by the technology that that the break

my government NASA has developed that you

just think they made up themselves right. What do you mean

think made it up when

to get to it? I want listeners, understand something notice, notice that she is not going to cover this. The meat is not

well cover that the show they're not going to cover this



because this is not my opinion. This is the real research that I have heard that that I have talked to arm

the generals commanding generals made

your generals, general generals, CIA, everybody and they're. All one hundred percent

and I thought it was a sign out before- and I've research and I've talked to hundreds of people now not not on air,

to make a film on this, who

taken Ayawaska and EMT? I have not taken it and for obvious reasons- and

and it's unbelievable because I mean they. One hundred percent in San Francisco is the main

project site,

literally have an alien base

and they are literally communicating and they've got like astronaut level people take

super hardcore levels of drugs and going into meetings with these things and making intergalactic deals and that again, that's what the guy

believes it says. They're doing when you say the government, it's a broad stroke, the painting



using a broad brush. What do you mean by the a rogue intelligence

ok. So what you're saying is essentially that they're using psychedelic drugs to communicate with interdimensional beings, Spirit Guide, everyone, every

who's done. A high dose of psychedelic drugs has had this experience, so everyone

listening to you right now, who's done DM

tea or done five

terms of Psilocybin. They know

this is you have some

kind of communication with something else? The question is: is that something else

inside your psyche or is that something

it's a chemical doorway. Is there a chemical doorway inside the mind that opens up in the

leaf? Is that when you die- and this is the the afterlife is

and when you die your brain,

deuces these chemicals, these chemicals ope

this doorway- and this is the

portal to the next dimension, so you're saying

saying that the



government is aware of this, and they must be aware of this. I've heard enough people talk about it. They must have done experiments on it. What a scientist usually put on another secret of the universe for sure and people that have the courage to expect

with these things and try them themselves realize that this is such a profound experience that it is

it's so alien that

alien landed right now in our parking lot and

a little gray, man with big black eyes got out. It would be nothing compared to what I've seen on psychedelic trip. So let me just tell you

me getting into the show is just because some people need to understand that. I know about this for a long time and I just don't think people are ready for it. But a lot of folks who.

Have low oxygen and and who adult brains well. Well, who have sleep apnea of big big next big hedge tongues, God thank you.

You go down a sixty two percent oxygen, that's another time that

Brain releases DMT,



show my whole life since I was about my first memories. Were every night was a DMT trip, so I basically

I don't want this to sound again. It's not I've, seen everything. Well, I believe that

When you're dreaming, it's most likely the same chemicals that are being released at what a key point that when you go in the room sleep it opens the gate which side is a proven. Your brain is working on the fourth fifth sixth dimension,

and if you can work into those two measures, you could see beyond it. So that's what I'm trying to tell you this. I don't already know all this show if you're on it, here's what's happening.

Much saying your bad. I never said you were in the CIA. I say the CIA is on record with Timothy Leary and everybody promoting elusive

the sixties. They admitted it was a plan to try to

She we doing the public to make the more suggestible, but there's a.

Larger program and they kind of backed off because it



got out of control and actually created some people that were actually fighting him, so it didn't have any effect they wanted.

They moved on the on

the t that they promoted, which goods

people that have accomplish compass, don't have problems with that. Weak minded, stupid people on others. Here's an example, this guy smart, Eric

Mancow Muller

skin is made out of it on the show. Before I tell you what she likes, I like him to come around. He well everybody's everybody's on this quest, and I told you I thought, like a hundred people, I've talked to more

A lot of people are going to do in these. The GMT and Iowa trips outside Austin they're, going all over the place. Yes and.

I'm on the show. You told me the same story: everybody tells you in Peru are being

Rekha. He wanted to traipse down there and he said yeah um,



we're sitting there and we take the Alaska and then all these basically elves aliens come out of the

and we're all sharing the same aliens were all hearing the same thing and it's like

read three of us or whatever seeing and he goes, but it was the drugs of

act on our brains? No no address.

Everyone sees something different when you open a gate and now

Now, interdimensionally your brains already filtering out most stuff, because

you can't handle it. Your eyes are already seeing like a cat. It's like seeing something in order

dog will you know when they first identified? There's certain certain

opponents to ayawaska, and one of them is harming

and when they first identified it, they tried to call it telepathy mean the reason why they call it telepathy in because when they were taking ayawaska we're having these group experiences that were undeniable that we're experiencing like very

vividly the same things.

So the governments obviously obsessed with this and isn't working out, but here's the problem here is a problem that term the government. You talk,



post office? No, no, I'm not officers on the street, the street talking with the fire department, I'm talking about ruling techno ruling, but who are these people, but I think the government is a shitty turn. I know they are okay, but that term the problem with that.

Is it lumps you in? Did you know that

Gibson movie. Conspiracy theory was a wacky. Dude was driving a cab believed in fucking. Tinfoil hat type should have been tortured, yes, exactly compartmentalized, yes, but that kind of stuff. When you say the government is doing

cool, is doing this who's working on these experience.

Names, no, no, no, here's the thing visually. Okay, maybe you want to say that the governor I'll show you know you're right. It's done to say the government and the big question is who runs things? That's more question: that's the thing is the day when everybody, so

is they don't want you to know? I remember that Fucking guy, who is ripping people off like weight loss, seek

so they don't want you to know Kevin Trudeau and they put him in jail for that he's in jail.

Now you won't get off the money. He's got a pile of cash somewhere and he said he would do that



they said that we have Kevin. Trudeau, I think, is a con man up enema few times very manipulative

I think he has a right

to say healthcare cures, natural cures. They don't know

There are some. There are some of the point. Is they don't look? I have some love in my heart for Kevin Trudeau because he started the international pool tour

was he was putting a lot of money in a professional pool yeah, but I mean I mean: here's the oxy cotton company. The documents came out shit

we're going to totally a dick people and then we're going to sell him drugs

to get off of it. Yes, that's pure frickin, either so locked their ass up and then we'll get the capital later I agree with, and I'm not even

fending ever because I met with every few times. I know all about

and it was like he was one hundred percent about him in a one way, freight ST well, I didn't get that experience with

with me and him just talked about pool. I was doing some stuff with him when he was first starting. The pool tour came to a couple of his events, but he that



hey this thing that was like you always have a good way of asking questions. Instead of saying who runs it all right, you wait till I do the cliche, the government and you correct me what I'm doing is playing devil's advocate and I'm also looking at it from the perspective of five hours and he's coming to another hour and get dinner. Okay, let's let joy

you yeah to no. No, no, no, not not yet you want to come in.

Two instead of one whenever you want anyways,

Let me try to be clear, I'm having a good time with you. I just want. You know we try to be clear. I can't say all of this on here and I'm going to leave it at that, but

on record twenty years ago before anybody,

talking about the clockwork, elves and now the think they're in touch with these entities and things

only because I don't want to get I'm, not the CIA

the CIA is bigger than Coca COLA. It's in basic, bigger than Walmart



I've never been an intelligence agency. I've never been part of any of the stuff, but I had family that was in advanced DARPA research projects that I don't know all the details about and

I was a kid. My dad told me about some of it. Not knowing I'd be a talk show host later, like when the

director the CIA needed to have to tooth pulled okay,

show my dad, like the doctor to you, know these guys and remember it around. The kitchen

unlike 70s, like

can't, tell you all about it, but it's a classified program in Maryland and underground an they basin

all the details, but it's double the money I'm making now this international security, but I think I think it's basically, you know we're going to we're. Building cyborgs

got special forces that have volunteered, so we can infiltrate

Russians and get two codes

systems and I believe it's implanting, but messages in

Jason and and uh

as I do in plants. I think it's a brain surgery program for microchips, and so I'm here, girls



David, I'm sick of these people and you've already done so much for the cut government and

but they've already done to you in a my my brother. You're. Not going to be you know,

I want you out of this, so this is

you know, seven years old or not hearing about your hearing about the cyborgs, okay, okay, so show that's the kind of stuff

I grew up. Seeing and you know, let's go get your uncle he's coming off a c one hundred and thirty. You are

day in army uniform from Guatemala. The others arm guys

I don't know okay and I don't need to know. Okay,

point is, is that's what I grew up. You know the type of stuff I saw, and

my dad never told me about all this stuff. When I was old,

her till it was like twelve years

So I was finishing in game blueprint for global enslavement. That's free still online! It's all about,

world government and out of cell phones watching you and everything everything proven it.

Country was the plan for one world government and don't have kids and all that attack on the family,



and we were gonna go ballet recital for like my three year old daughter, she's like fourteen hour, and they sit down for like an hour and watch the end of the film's three our film and my mom goes David. That's not

true. He goes yes. It's all true when I was in June

International Recruitment of the program there.

And they said the Nazis were wrong because they're only targeting certain groups were going, everybody and the planetary.

Breakaway in world government and blah blah blah

nuclear reactor under UT, T and also stuff, which later went actually truth even hidden. But the point is

that my dad was that special, my dad was like the score

The six smartest in texas- and I had a group of less

and kids and they brought him in his juniors in high school and said we're going to

do all this like they recruited, because 'cause want to be an ass, that's where the national, so when he gets in here because

right NASA a big secret group. It's the other side of the breakaway government. There's the CIA Breakaway government, one thousand nine hundred and forty seven



there's Kennedy setting up NASA one thousand nine hundred and sixty one so there to do,

competing breakaway governments and those

are the real garbage of the. When you say by breakaway governments. What do you mean breakaway govern,

breakaway civilizations, each the real grew.

That are like the cult you say who are they there scientist who, based on

your psychic ability,

and on your iq and then on your commitment to the program. So the

program- starts- starts with you: go check black people with syphilis for a greater cost or

will you do research programs on babies where we,

for women

Oh, your baby died right. There were born early will, keep the baby alive and sometimes kill him, sometimes harvest them, sometimes just experiments on

why they've got a lot of nurses, have notice now that baby's disappeared birth

Maybe that's, why the governor said who's? Actually organ harvesting doctor? He goes. We



people, the are love after the blonde have a discussion they're getting caught now 'cause. We did

metalized? What I'm?

Choose what you see now? It just never ends yeah. What are you saying about babies like what are they doing with babies? You saw the governor of Virginia say we keep babies alive after their born, kill him right. Well, I didn't

him comfortable, I am very, very concerned with late term

abortions, post post birth, Joe understand post.

How much money do you think they get

with for a seven and a half pound baby? They can keep a lot for two weeks and momma doesn't know so

register the organs and get bidders

but to me, then they can make five hundred thousand, but if you saying you did Bailey, they kill on the spot, only get fifty grand, but even saying they take them.

From the mother and the mother doesn't know that the baby's alive

You know how they engineered tomatoes, the last on the shelf. Yes,.



You, can pull all this up challenge?

just passed it.

No should be Virginia is about to pass in New York. Trying to pass a California founded, passing

other states trying to pass it to keep.

Babies alive and allow notice the governor goes

We don't want this three minute clip hold up. We don't want to go

some involve the doctors and the mother, who's drugged up, even say that

I'm gonna decide sad about the future, and maybe she

baby alive a week. Maybe

I to get rid of baby wait a minute. Is this a viable

maybe there's something wrong with this babe viable. The Schinias voted three days ago on Monday to not pass a bill for

birth abortion to not kill livable, Post bird says viable babies,

already born can be killed if the bioethics port. I bet you.

And millions pull that up Jamie. We gotta figure this. I know the letters won't. Believe me. I absolutely would you go finding posts about this, but it says that it's been taken out of car



text. What is that media matters? More Snopes Huffington Post is at Snopes, mostly false, Huffington Snopes

we're! No. Why don't you do this shame Jamie? Go you go to the source of the governor, go to you

tube and type in?

Virginia talks about post birth, abortion watch the unedited three minutes. How do you call it abortion if it's already been born? Well, that's what true

said he said he said a month ago in this way

broke, he said and see. The left is: soaking

I'm not saying the that mainstream media, whatever we're so censored now, they're, making move right now now

mobilised, technocracy, the mad scientist, the guys that are

want to learn the secrets. The universal we only hand. So what you're saying is a lot of the censorship, a lot of one mil. I don't have ten million I will give,

before God and country to Jaimes. I'm not kidding



give one million dollars to your charity of choice. No listen to me

This trip changed. I come up with the children

I will give you one million. If you can prove that I'm

king out that the governor said we keep babies alive after they're born. We keep him comfortable.

And turns out he's an organ harvesting thing and that's what they're doing

keep babies alive, don't go to snow.

The governor go to the governor of Virginia

that's why they went ahead and burning for the black face. They're using the blackmailing

They say that on him, it's the same guy as soon as he said

soon as Trump and we all covered as soon as he tweeted. He said,

yes, we're getting rid of babies after they're already born. You don't want to know

figure out with George Soros put in it right

I mean I oversimplified that immediately note that I know what I said: they've weaponized marijuana into a hallucinogen category.



Causes more schizophrenia. I think it does. I said that

Goncourt neighbor yeah. I think it does it does certain people have friends who are already susceptible yes and the weeds so strong that that that that that they start thinking that I'm worrying,

want to be sure she knows, and I agree with you on that I mean I think, come I have Cintron alpha types needed to not have a heart attack. Well, I don't

I need to remember when you wanted me to smoke pot with you in that in that bathroom shooting a video like as a joke like twenty years ago, yeah yeah, that I say that makes me apparently yeah. That was funny Joe. The only time I feel for were wearing fucking, George Bush and George Bush senior master dancing around the capital.

Sometimes today's value, the feast

with the song. He wrote you at that fucking song about it Jamie Jamie. This is a joke. I will give one dollar million. You don't have to give any money, but I believe you I just want a little, but I have skin in the game.

My phone, I believe you I mean he's going to find it will listen to it. You don't have to we're listening to you,

and then he uses these arguments. He uses these arguments,



Well, sometimes the baby. Sometimes the baby is

is the phone. No, they want the organs

and so told the planned parenthood, videos of Texas and California. Two years of

the project, VERITAS others got where they're saying I'm getting

Yellow Ferrari

Man, I'm making hundreds of thousands off each baby, we've partial birth. They keep the baby alive, they take it in the back.

They have a van pull up that takes it to

a chinese government run facility in the U S and they got the sucker. Let's listen after birth aboard. This is Jim Eyes this. It Alex okay, a hearing yesterday, when Fairfax County delicate Cathy Tran made her case for lifting restrictions,

on third trimester abortions, as well as other restrictions now in place, and she was pressed by

public and delegate about whether her bill would permit an abortion, even as a woman is especially dilating ready to give birth and she answered that it would permit an abortion at that stage of labor.



Do you support her measure and explain her answer

I wasn't there Julie and I certainly can't speak for Delegate Tran, but I will tell you one

first thing I would say this is why decisions such as this should be made by

writers of physicians

and the mother son and file?

shopping around. I JANET interrupt notice, he's usurping law, their whole plan.

It's bioethics on display in a but it's only two minutes: mothers and fathers,

that are involved there

You know when we talk about third trimester abortions. These are done with the consent.

Obviously the the mother with the consent of the

physicians. More than one physician by the way- and it's done

cases where there may be severe deformities. There may be a fetus, that's non bible. So in this particular example,



if a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered the

if it would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if, if that's what

the mother and the family desired, and then it does

Russian would ensue between the physicians and the mother, so so I think this was really blown out of proportion.

But again we want the government not to be involved in these types of decisions. We want the decision to be made by the

the mothers and their providers, and this is why Julie

that legislators, most of whom are men by the way shouldn't, be telling a woman what she should and

don't be doing with her body and do you think

opal position should have to weigh in, as is currently required, she's trying to lift that requirement? Well, I think it's all

good to get a second opinion and for for at least two providers to be involved in that decision, because these decisions shouldn't be taken lightly.



And so that you know I would, I would certainly support more than one provider all right. Let's go back to the wow, that's a weird thing that she's kinda, let him say: I'm

these the story but hold on a second that's, what's weird is that the

She was they talking about about resuscitating the baby that they would keep the

be alive, then a decision would be made. Isn't that that's like you think

Asia, like you, can grand. Why you're so smart gentleman, your ass, but you can't do that to you. Grammy right, you

families like. Eighty years old, you can't you can't just kill

well member districts over the Newsweek cover the case for killing granny. They say

so. Let me explain now: you've got it

you hear that legalese turns out

when I saw that clip a month ago, because they had a doing debate about the bill,

and they said yeah we'll kill babies after they're born and their debate. How

far on one of the doctors say, but it's

jurisprudence, there's law. You can't do that. So this is a the government



involved. This is the medical system you sharpen if they can,

little baby after it's born

sometimes they deformed naughty, sometimes sometimes a phone. Here's, the key notice,

he said we resuscitate they'd

don't consider you alive till the Bio Ethics Board,

Shash, that you're a viable human and under the bar,

traffic in Europe and U Un now, which is all

watch it below the E. U was set up by the Volkswagen among his full trying to sell, but that that was little drawn. The first we'll talk about Hitler Alley the

example. When Hitler was a really bad dude, but he literally so much for world government

everything.

They had a system where they first killed. Babies, they thought were deformed. That was one thousand nine hundred and thirty four

And the final solution happened like six seven years later, and so he sang 'cause.

A big problem, they've got undercover videos are keeping babies alive. You won't pull those up, I'm not B S, Ing, there's hot, so they've got a

start getting it going now, with God,



physicians in people to

because the nurses to freaking out and they're, saying

we're keeping babies alive and they get put in a van and drive away. What's going on there I would get

comfortable show the baby.

Worth five hundred thousand dollars who's playing in the chain of delivery. Just on time, delivery

a lot of money and of but

if you kill him right on the spot.

Like wow, we waste in this seven pounds of meat, so she

they can keep him alive, and now they built these new wings. They

new, so I could pull up, but they have wings where they go,

So we consider the baby dead, the

other decided it didn't live. If

he decides we resuscitate and lives, but it

Jayden resuscitate its flesh. It's

at least it's passed into a special ward, with doctors

make a few million a year

and a little bit a little flesh. Ball is kept alive.



Double until

All the orders come in the planes land and they take the organs. Then they take the blood

and they take the ski and Joe.

You see how it works,

now you know with his voice. No no but see is a southern love invoice. You see my dad new organ harvesters in Dallas

and he said, don't sign your organ donor card they've got corrupt hospitals. Where

you are totally viable, they take your organs, cheese and then I said-

dad you're crazy, but inside the organ donor card, and

it might end the hospital too in Dallas then,

When I was DEC a decade later my

grandparents, house, warming, grandpa, dad watch sixty minutes and it was Dallas, TX and Chicago caught killing people that were viable to take their organs tonight. The sixty minutes-

expos and it was a freaking hospital, my dad told me about Jesus Christ,

that's what I'm telling you is where you



At the kitchen table, when you right here in about cyborgs

That's why I know about this. My dad never got fully into it. He decided to get out of it.

And he decided to get out of it.

You're legitimately freaking me the fuck out Joe. I will

I will let you know the problem- is some of it makes sense, because people figure

the way to rationalize a lot of things. If you see a guy's mangled in the cracks it's but he's still alive- and you know you

until the bags broken econsave five love yeah

I mean yeah I mean, but the thing is how many people would have to be involved,

to be real Joe. I can show you.

Let's not exaggerate. Fifth

videos of

planned parenthood workers laughing

saying I made a one million bucks yesterday last year. It's incredible, we just keep him

longer will get ten times the money rolling. In fifty fifty grand baby baby. We we gotta, kill him before they leave the building. The mother doesn't know



talk her into it. Oh ma'am, you're, three months pregnant, all the baby might have a problem, might have a heart murmur. Oh the ultrasound, oh yeah, and then they get you

we're going. This is truth yeah they

keep it alive, but only a few hours and they got

get planes coming in advance vans and they don't get the full price because they can't put it on the auction. They've got digital corporate

auctions. Look this up for organs me bring something up.

I had this guy on yesterday yesterday, with this book Eleanor Coast name. Is you on

and he's he's an investigative

analysts who lives in Mexico when he studies the cartel they shall organs, and what this one of the things he was saying was that they get these people used to killing and they were getting the

kids and having these kids kill at a young age and dismember people, and they were doing it to get the fear out of the body

this one guy? Who was they they a nickname for him Tyson? He would he was a cop,

but he was also in charge of hiring these little kids and



training, these little kids to be assassins and he would teach them how to dismember people

is going into it and all the things they did all all the beheadings that they did. He was saying that they try to that in certain certain groups

of people when they have this organization. They try

try to get them used to horrific act. Let's call the cement of blood, and that's a

Heinrich Himmler term

head of the ss- is that the SS

yes, Joe Hitler had about seven eight years for the war, so he got

like twelve year olds, ready for war, and they would get him like

fun and swimming and working out at boxing, and then they would like weather like

give a hot hooker.

Give him drugs drugs Ellis eating and discovered Switzerland. Hitler was put them on D, DMT, everything and

We would then have these religious experiences and set your invincible, you're so

per. This is all been declassified, but it's more esoteric writings and so

they would get him all wound up and then to graduate



an ss officer after you've had a dog. Like five years. You had to strangle your german Shepherd

yeah that was my friend ARI. His dad was in the israeli special forces or one of those one brand. Would you what branch was one

branch of the israeli military and they had to kill a kitten

and look Jews are just like anybody else. There's good people are bad people, but yeah Israel

I got so screwed by the Nazis

sickening away, just kind of copied a lot of it and by the way

is trying to kill him up. Not even my point is: is that the Nazi

got evil down. So much that, like we brought thirty four thousand into a NASA, the run the university's paper

everybody wanted they were, they were like winning the lottery

they were all robots to do whatever they were told. Well, one VON Braun

was absolutely and he was a show, show,

show it would happen was first they gave him shacks. They gave him power, they would really press room. You have to go

two things and then they would basically,



know just condition them to do whatever they were told. They call this a

the blood because then

like you know, kill your dog remember

I was going to ruffle Texas. I ran like a satanic cult, has got this girl's a senior in high school she's super odd, I'm in I'm in I'm in I'm in ninth grade

she's. Picking me up in a Mercedes and I'm taking me some mansion. The with her is incredible:

and I'm walking out of the house. Is that look like

sixteen when I was thirteen

you like screwing, my daughter, I screw her too

just as soon as you join us love Lucifer, you get all the will tell you want boy 'cause. We want you, but

glad. It's really oh yeah, but that's yeah, not incredible. Life. Look also do now, but the point is: is that you know shell you're in la you know about all this, but the point is I don't know about all that. The point is: is that

the Satanist is that I really got into this and they said well, I said: what do you want? 'cause? I don't want to be like we want you to kill your dogs, and so

point is: is that now all these years later



kill a loving thing that serves you cares about.

This interface dogs are very psychically. Second, buffers dogs are able to people like interface with you and they will

You take something, that's ready to die for you and they want you to kill that that's like killing a child. The dog is very similar child,

very spiritual, very holy you're, very good. At Donald,

its masters Florida.

It could be evil, but

early fall. My God servers people

about all this? And this is what's going on, and this is what's happening and shows

you want to submit a blood. Is they get people in a group

they get into horrible evil things during per pressure and they create the synthesis. You have to know the darker elements of the

criminal networks that are inside our government. Our app

running Mexico as a laboratory test,

so native Americans, Americans are Americans are and HO and and tough and they're ready to fight. You know I'm part native American, like six percent Comanche, and you know

Texas, and just that little bit makes me wild, and so they can get them



because they're, powerful they're, smart, they're, neat, they're cool, but.

Genetically they go into group, think really really fast and so native Americans. You can mind, control really fast. Well, it's like Vietnam. I mean you know the

The the the the the Bering Land straight in base a test as you

six of of of measure,

especially Chinese

because there was always some whites and vikings even two thousand years ago in the area, but um like that. Nobody in fights in Korea fight the Chinese. That's really

error. Vietnam assist. Do you think it's working? I mean they're like their conscious and real people, but when they get into a

right, they all sync up in a robot that had no fear I mean

psychotic killers are fighting, and so

Asians are by about the most fearless killers. There are like the Mongols with any of them do stuff. Then, once Asians go to war, it's like they do not there. It's in fact



not even craze going wild in the battle there like robots, coming to kill you, and so you think that's from do. You think that

from the heritage of war that they have a long like, if you think about Japan, Japan,

a long history of being a noble warrior culture with the samurais and place the the Marshall from the nobility, it's the genetics,

right, but genetics is what creates that you know it's like five.

Have you loading planes, saying I mean what I'm saying is think about a place like Japan were so much martial arts came from

sword fighting

karate above a bunch of different branches of karate judo to Jitsu, Japan, all that stuff came from Japan, I mean that

that that is a group of people that were obsessed with combat mean they

they figured out. Ruling class was well not just that the soldier

and even the civilian. No, I agree, but the ruling class was samurai ya, yeah Gun's, the ruling class was the shoguns right and when you think about

What a small place Japan is now



dining in is that so much innovation, especially in terms of like Weiner Work, Marshall and I'll get into bell curve. You've got black people that are smart as any white person, and then you have black people that are way better,

March, whatever they're our genetic differences, when asked a and you've got the head of your former, you know I was cold springs, harbor watch,

comes out, says: blacks are inhuman. All that b. That's just the racist crap, it's in the government, but it's true that nor

some groups or northern Europeans, and then the Japanese

he's on average per capita have like you and

they're they're, Japanese and

there are some northern Europeans that have the highest Iqs, but

get into like say: Jews have very high, accused on average yearly Jews of extraordinary high, also really social files winners, it's a bunch of. So

not just one type of intelligence, yeah

oh for sure, yeah. Well, there's there's

There's tests that you can run in terms of mathematics but there's no real test. You can run in terms of social justice. Psychic connectivity



The dna is a transceiver and

My skill is that's why I'm usually kind of like almost autistic is I'm just being constantly like everything is going on, but then it actually focus in Aiken, like figure out the exact enemy opera.

That's why they're really pissed they people that

jewish that are german, they're, chinese or japanese or italian, or mexican people that

either through fear or whatever get into dark side light side get into.

Don't give people the knowledge control '

people down them down, dominate them,

Is there only rocket fuel for you to go?

the next level. You know what's interesting about this, not that you're right or wrong. What's interesting is how many people resist the idea that it's possible for someone to try to control everybody, and if you just go back in history, just you know, go back to world WAR two and how Hitler controlled germ



and that's it. They tell you no ones trying to control you, that's all that's going on, but that one is a particularly fantastic one

'cause. It was a culture that came out of a bad time right out of world.

For one and

by and this guy guy offered them pride in being german. He offered this this idea of a master race Damassa,

race is a crazy idea

because then, if you look at the black Israelites or you look at it at law, Raza are met you or you look at some of the right wing jewish groups. Every Chinese every group says with the master rules, yeah well sure, but I mean

many have tried to engineer the way Hitler did that's what's really crazy

exactly the reason, the reason the globalist. What if you want to you, want to get the signal, but I'm, but I'm saying, but I or sick or hold on a second. What I'm saying is that it is amazing that there is a guy

who has this idea of a master race and if you were, but people reject

it worldwide. It was one of most evil aspects of who he waas. That's really interesting to me that people reject



Did it because they knew it was like an improper calculation. General public rejected the idea other elites trying to duplicate it was an improper calculation. The calculation was the only way to get people that you want to get a master race. You have to have master genetics, but it didn't take into account was compassion

it didn't take into account what's necessary to have a real, healthy community. That was a slow, fucker, quick flash community

because everybody was like hyper focused on the nation.

To have a real long term community, you have to have compassion, you have to have camaraderie and

is going to be people who your use use the leftist compassion when they

for China and DRAM San, and you sharing the left cell Elkin,

action. We can't hurt anyone's feelings were helping arrest following gun and sell their organs that we're Google and talk to me you're right, you're right, the left has giant flaws and Asj.



Find flaws in its ridiculous ideas, I'm against war. I am too

so now you see. National studies show this Gallup Poll Democrats now support

or more than Republicans this is about.

This is about pulling out of screen, is trying to get denuclearize and everybody's loving it in South Korea and Japan and N Korea and he's actually got

not fire missiles destroyed. English is a real. The real problem there's a real problem, people not being able to say that anything that Trump does is good. If a Democrat was doing what Trump was doing on some issues, I just got some. I would support them. I don't give a damn what they do.

Here are well,

and so then Trump got rid of the

he's getting rid of the minimum sentences. I mean Hillary Clinton, you know, oh god. I saw this heather that I'm ranting, but I was watching I forget to the top down

That was they were on CNN. I'm going to play a clip of my show and I didn't do it and they and they go they go. They go. President Trump thinks blacks,



yeah. The clip was CNN, CNN says Trump thinks blacks are stupid,

and it was a CNN panel going Trump says,

Blacks are super predators who have to be brought to heel and Joe that

Hillary Clinton, one thousand nine hundred and ninety four after she passed the crime act. That's her quote, so

they're inverting reality. Knowing are talking point if she did that we have the video type. Hillary says

super readers. They said Trump in it. It's not about Trump

he didn't do that. Okay, but let's get

back to what trying to say was that if you, if he does anything good, no one can accept it. 'cause he's on the wrong team. That's part of the problem with what's going on, it's part of the.

Of people willing to accept ridiculous shit on the left and people willing to accept ridiculous shit on the right is that we get on a team and that the people that are on the left eye, candy

If the economy is going well, they can't admit it things they

bill. Maher said: let's crash economy,



I you know, I don't I don't. I lied. Listen. I've been on the show before, and I talked to him once we did a show together once with us right now. Nobody can lie and say that he's not very talented and, and that he's

first time he's more truthful than most left is. He says I

abortion death in highway he's a comic.

I'm telling you man, the shit that he

saying he's only saying 'cause, he thinks it'll work,

I'm just saying with this, but why would he say with the highest ratings ever gotten an invite me on. I don't know man, you have to talk to

but what I'm saying is when he starts talking like people are saying: oh Bill, Maher's mocking the red states he's doing a bit he's doing a bit.

He thought was funny in that. That's all it is I'll. Give you if you talk to him about his legitimate opinions, he's capable of having a

about legitimate disagree on that point.

Would you say that the red state

we want to be the blue states, the demographic show the opposite. I think. Is this a joke? A really do I do,



I think even means it I mean if he doesn't mean it, I disagree with them by the. Let me let let me have a basis to let me have agreed with you on this. I'm not saying you're wrong, because everything I've learned is great. There's mixtures of everything. Yes,.

Another time I go to the next slide. I forget the last thought, but the point is: is that is that

you we're saying was that he was doing a joke about the red States wishing that they were the blue states, and you were saying that that's wrong and I was saying he's just fucking around he's like

karate, that's it that's it.

Mainstream news is dead, as very low ratings mean, went down almost nothing and they go. Oh ratings are up in the Trump era like a dead cat bounce. It's like ten percent. I want to use

Larry King stuff,

three million viewers. Now the top CNN enjoys a million show we're looking at that. This is the future.

Is of this is that this is where the people are real things, not scripted, no teleprompters, there's telephone for sure this is real, and so they get.

On television



I'm literally having Alzheimer's was appointing. Are we were talking about Jesus Christ? One problem

where's, the problem with no teleprompter, I am literally,

What's in my brain disease like

the truth, is being an accurate, does mean a perfect.

I'm telling you when I really thought I don't wanna fucking around. I know what it is.

No one's watching mainstream news? No one's watching, mainstream news shrimp.

Let me tell what they are watching the big five, the night

Comic shows and comedy central shows. The daily show Trevor Noah

uncle bear all those guys, because they want some relief, but it's not. They want relief.

I used to watch the ratings are down a still understand, as you know, as as as as other stuff, because now that the old, no one's watching news does this on Hannity do really well is in his show what not only Fox, because it seems alternative just like you, but but but but I'm saying as well comes along

particularly as well. This is the truth.

Not like some package thing



learn all of the so called comic shows into fake comics, posing as

news people putting out political commentary

which people take Israel and believe

on the street, and so that's where all the prop

Ganda is, and so you say Bill Mars. Just joking around Bill Maher just over here Bill Maher, does note doing it's all unified message. They have

Kobe for them laid upon here and say that I'm a KKK member and

jokes on. You know what people shouted at me on the street. Well, that's unfortunate, but I will say about

they're trying to do they're not trying to deliver information, they're, not they're, trying to crack jokes again,

t there's a whole writing staff Donovan. Although shipments take the Democrats called that element to right now, I don't know if that's true

but if it is as true and they do listen, that's not good and that's unfortunately, host the man show with Doug Stanhope, know the other guy,

not what wanted to there's,

Jimmy Kimmel and says he gets calls every day from Chuckie Schumer, and

and then they work on what he says



television show type of that's so frustrating might have been fucking around, though no dude, it's talking points man, okay, I believe you, I believe you

here or lost

Jimmy Fallon went from being funny to being totally weaponized

so you think it was NBC's idea. Do you think it was someone in the government that contacts and be says television exile is a very well known, UFC fighter that you know, okay,

do that shows on discovery. History channel, like I said, okay and I got a call about a month ago and they're like wow. This is incredible,

don't say my name, you can talk about it. They were

This new big, lucrative shell, show what they said. You're going to come

announce Alex Jones on the show or

I'm the show, and he said no show help

yeah man, huh good

announce him on the show why they need that from you him.



Yeah, but what what what they need that from him they didn't because heroes and him here's an ounce you on the show, I'm not that that's just keep, but that gives you even more attention. Well, let me explain: that's their dilute,

Well, they want everybody else sensor. Why did Hitler sensor lot of the Russians,

like you think, most of time censorship actually works.

But that's a weird one man, someone saying they're not going to

you a gig. Unless you specifically denounce Alex Jones, it happened. What kind of show is it they're cooking show? No Joe Joe, let me break it down for you, okay, I swear on my kids.

I believe you, I believe you, but I'm saying it just seems so crazy. They would ask him to not to denounce you wanna tell

I'm not saying it's impossible. That's what everybody who's not independent is told because they're behold, other people, you're a rare

I'm on the only people that not hold any other network of people, your you realize that not just tell us some kinship who else has a big mega

popular show,

multimedia that isn't



roll by a parent company, I'm Corolla yeah um, most podcast,

no, no, but see when you look at the numbers at most podcasts threatened by though, but I mean almost all of her back by something in the city. I know for a fact.

You run your own show yep, that's a fact! Look. I've got some notes,

and all I want to say is this. I want to point one one point you had about that. That was really good. You were

and then, if you censor yourself just like, I just sent myself a little bit. So we wanted to make this point. We started the show, but please make it big enchilada. You made it

the start over and it's right, you we were talking,

and we were first of all, we gave each other a big hug. We talked it out.

We're both happy that we're not angry

each other, and then we start talking

when you made a really good point. You said the thing is: if you sense yourself, just one percent, you say I'll, just censor myself,

one percent, that's what they want to make them happy and then they're just going to keep moving it they're just going to keep moving forward



move, the goal posts and providing you with more money and giving you more things but keep moving in a certain direction and if you keep giving into it, they're gonna have a whole deal and they can

control you and that's how network television got started. If you really think about what NED for network television is

reason why they don't swear and they don't have explicit content, isn't because people wouldn't want to see it. The reason is because the the advertisers won't. Let

there's a whole commerce aspect to it. It's not it's not just hey

you're the CSI guys, air, hey exactly and so now, they've organized with sleeping giants and media matters, a couple million p

all that call and threaten and attack. Anybody

and the notice show one.

Were done with me. Now, it's Joe you better, not have this person on. Are you better have that person on? And so what is your soul? What is your destiny worth and

I always thought I was smart. I can analyze politics in history. I was kind of socially retarded and show how big you want to say that anymore,

exactly, but I mean I was and so



What I'm getting at is the biggest liars with our people know the truth. I don't come up with some cold blooded calculation about what I think,

advance my personal life. I really care about people and the process

seen things wrong. I've grown I've heard people. I apologize. Listen, that's true! That's true! What you're just saying about you- and this is one of things that I've always tried to explain to people. If people get mad

at me for knowing him like. I have a great time with that guy. Every time I see him you and I have had a

great time in Austin, we had a great time with the UFC we've hung out at numerous comedy shows that have done in Austin

I've done your films years ago. We've had a lot of fun together and so when, when people get mad at you,

about sandy hook or about anything I just go even when he

even when you were mad at me, I wasn't mad at you. I was like I just got to talk to him. It's one of the

Eddie. Bravo got the two of us to talk again once we talk just be honest with each other,

I'll, be fine, and I want to clear this up, because



when I was going big guns on you just so you know what it's like to be judged. I thought the

never having a show is not an attempt to get back on your. I knew that if I got into the point where you were that upset that I must have made mistakes too, I'm not I'm not

a person that sees things and always points in the other direction. I pointed mice, I'm a fucking ruthless self critic, ruthless. I'm terrible like so I beat my

up about every thousands flood one word on stage and I'll.

So let me someone this tossing and turning. Let me raise this to you

and again self. That's a good thing is he's not gonna, be in our system. Crazy. I got offered at the time like five million dollars with a bit coin. I think it's like thirty, eight million dollars by the time I got there. I refused it and I, and I got told like SH eight years ago I got told by two different people a very well known bridge people. They said a short Charles, like she wants to.



Could you an Alexander Soros's, others or us? You just need to stop attacking moon and and by the way we want you to pump decline, which may I believe,

currencies I believe in the future. We had a private federal reserve. It's all fiat, I'm not judging anybody

I'm just okay, be careful.

And I was so dumb back. I want to say so dumb. I was not in the corrupt mindset. The way the world worked like. I knew how politics work and I knew

science work and I knew how Crypto type government-

CIA stuff worked, but I was like

we're trying to get a deal for myself. I had my own thing right so then I look back in retrospect

where, where that was going on so

when I saw you was my breaking point. Go hey Alex Jones is full of crap

Soros was a victim of the Nazis in the Holocaust. That's not what I said I didn't see you

bull crap, I said he wasn't a nazi. I go to the store

three that I I've watch the interview and I don't know what he



you know guy? I don't know him, I don't know, I've know very little about him, but what I

from the story was that he was saying that when the

Nazis occupied,

he was with his. I believe it was his uncle Father is Godfather.

Took him around as a Christian and pretended he was a Christian. They were stealing from these Jews when they would take their and he

just thought. It was normal because he was thirteen years old, but he was talking about it that he was shielded

why this person, oh, I would be willing to take his explanations. What I'm saying, but but but but but here's the difference even before that happened with you

I got approached by a major Hollywood actor that

associated with, and they said, listen

George Soros told me to tell you that he had been killed

if he didn't do that and that and that

that he did what he had to do right- and I said,

tell George: if somebody

put a gun to my head and said we're going to kill you. If you don't



help round up Joe Rogan's kids and put it in a concentration camp,

hey. Oh yeah, I agree with you. I've got the gun and kill. Did you see

you said it was just taking property. Now they were

it was even actually showing take your property and then you don't go away. I don't know

I mean we know what happened in romanian hungry but Joe, but I mean what he was saying. They have headlines saying: ok,

So you're saying you think that it was more no, no

he did an NPR interview, I'm not try,

trying to go indict. George Soros, okay. Well, here's where I fucked up 'cause. I shouldn't even said anything about it. 'cause I don't know much about it. The real

open to interpretation. I've seen I've seen a couple of childhood reputation when I was sorted into interpretation from me, I'm telling you I don't know anything so well. Let me talking about it was incorrect sure. So when I'm fourteen

back if somebody said we're. Gonna, you're, you're, gonna, help round of your community or we're gonna kill you. I would have tried to kill people that were trying to kill me able.



Don't get it not everybody's like me and I'm not trying to the top of sky around. I think I've proven I'll go up against people. I get your fourteen you're scared and you help the knot.

He was so arrogant about it. He said it on NPR. He started on sixty minutes

and then I learned you're being sued 'cause. You did this. This is why he's financing? Well, I'm not going to

stop saying it because of that I get, he was wasn't,

situation. The problem was, if you play the clip, he says,

best time of my life. It was happy making uh

it was. It was invigorating

to be there with all this evil going on, but I was with my father and I had faith in him

and so we were able to do this and then I and looked at the logs and the records of him he was going.

Over and Frank's man and

their money and ally. Now he got the money is another, I'm not here, and I would just run of a white flag. George Soros

George Soros

over through all these different governments, George Soros trying to crash the pound,



George Soros is, that is the art type of James Bond villains and the fact that his money-

I remember, being a kid when I was

like eight years?

my mom- always had a color tv in the kitchen.

Three, no stop you. Can I stop you?

What are you saying that he's like crashing

economies and when I was

kid watching PBS. Maybe they were lying. Maybe he's great

George Soros- was international currency speculator who, over

through government? You know booty yeah? But that's what I'm saying? What are you saying? Overthrew governments

What do you do? I'd literally? No, not well! Here's a I'll tell you! This is actually the class, for you know anything about your source. Jamie noticed little type, a George Soros, a question about okay, more

in George Soros's view after world war? Two he got high

brought for us. He was

for the CIA Oss before that, in his view from his



I think this has. He admitted he doesn't brag about this. Okay, George Soros is the guy willing to take the money and Debbie it out.

And he's a very bold guy, because she's really smart

kissing his ass hurting. My back is going to want to make my own wall towards what it does have a.

Why did you want to hang your head on the wall I want after, but the point

Doesn't matter, George Soros ran the break up of the Soviet Union. George I've had

Former head of of Chevy got Jamie Guy thing.

George Soros could try to crash the pound, the pound anyways, guys. Okay, I told you they got human pick cap that you people like to

Yeah. Okay, I told you they're keeping babies alive. You saw the governor, said: okay,

George Soros is highest level deep state

he. He is the manager or was the manager. Are you sure things you're saying actually no



But how do you know if you have deep research? He ran the because I'm not the Alex Jones. Ten ago he ran the.

Marshall. We got here,

George Soros break. The Bank of England make little bigger police in Britain

black Wednesday September sixteenth right right to the day. The speculators broke the pound, they didn't actually break it, but they forced the british guy.

To pull it from the European Exchange rate mechanism joining the e r, which was part of the the Europe the the pound, wants Europe scroll up. Please all those to depart from the European CUP.

He's the british pound, blah blah blah, compounding the underlying problems inherent in the pounds, inclusion in the e r M, not not seeing this where's the part where George Soros does this. Well?

that's just what you pulled up, but I'm just I'm just trying to find it. That's all I'm saying spotting

the writing on the wall. Britain upped its interest rates to teens and attract people to the pound, but specula

Is George Soros among them began heavily

shorting the currency the british government gave in with



through its Hea R, the e r M, as it became clear that it was losing

aliens trying to bully its currency artificially, although

is a bitter bitter pill to swallow, the pound came back stronger because the excess

Tristen high inflation Joe Force,

how did you go to an investor to pdf like it's the boss, hello? He there's films about the Soros? Is our rooms Soros, pocketed one billion dollars on the deal and cemented his reputation as the premier

currency speculator in the world. If you're a

see speculator? Isn't that what you do, though? I don't know what a currency

circulated does it? I don't want to get it. Here's the deal

George Soros works for the works for the people that run our government

and he's a guy willing to do it all and he's been very successful. Okay. My point

is two plus two equals four in my in my equation. You don't fight

Nazis, because you're

fourteen, you think you can't you join them and he says he talk to me about the investment I, if I,



have done it. Someone else would have done it. That's a quote. It was happy making

if you help round up Jews and take their property, don't say it was happy make you don't talk about it, so

my point, is him saying you you think the way he describes it even as a problem? It's problematic

herbs you the ways describing that it was happy making that it was not a big deal. If I didn't do it, other people have done it. That's a problem.

When us, I'm I to get off the Soros. Is that if you

at five minutes over their own Jamie's computer. He did a good job. He does a great job, saying it pull stuff up. He's a goddamn, Google wizard look at them. Let little has been beat me a quick to it

frustrated, I would have gone over there. I can pull up Soros. I can pull up BBC

the reports sort

crash is the british pound are trash. Here's

sample, and I'm not indicting you for this.

Someone in my family about ten years ago was digging through stuff for basically garage,

wasn't, wasn't Roger, give it away to charities and



you all these clothes I couldn't wear. Is I didn't hundred hundred pounds anymore and

got into a group of things, and there was a

japanese bayonet. There was a german

officers dagger that I bought for like two hundred dollars. That's worth like two thousand. I still have it wow and

and all the rest of it and there was a british metal in a nazi metal, and this

and in my family 'cause there's like a power thing goes: oh my god, you're a Nazi's

I walk in she's, going to the garage and up the box and not go. I bought this at a gun, show like a decade

yeah. I think a friggin swasta metal thing, though, is if you own. This is the thing if you like see that helmet that you were twelve going yeah that that we show now this one is a joke. It

You get to it. So you've got a german helmet that a french artist dug up with all these mass graves wouldn't phone, and it's got a german band that you're not a freak and not see that's a piece of history. I think that's a! U S soldier, another



german helmet. That's a german helmet, that's a kernel, but it doesn't matter. Free

has banned owning german war. Memorabilia Sonian

the coolest thing ever saw the Smithsonian when I was a kid so proud of us being the Nazis.

I had a german helmet with a bullet hole in

the Smithsonian is not not see. That's what I'm saying: I'm not not see

for having a nazi metal and a bunch of other war paraphernalia I thought was cool.

You're, not a nazi for a nazi bayonet

helmet in a bayonet. What this gentleman's name that makes such as Jane Martin. Can we show it please what is his yeah? We showed it. He also

made me a fucking super dope. Skull he's got a

not cool, ignore artist, the german helmets interested that's. What I was going to say is that you could have a Nazi helmet twenty years. Look about hogans heroes, Hogans Heroes is

sitcom about Nazis, the sitcom about Nazis

and prisoners of war. I mean that was

correctness that I literally had a family member. This was like



eighteen years ago. Go I'm really upset about what I found Shane against the machine right yeah is that is now in the garage and it's like Br

metals, US metals. A couple of that. Of course, I wanted the japanese thing that isn't even had a marine carbine from Vietnam. That's not

This is cool as well

or two yet go to Shane against the machine on Instagram. Now there is so he's not a nazi. That's free

in cool man. I doesn't much of those. He sells, those folks if you want one going to a product plugs plugged into the store good dude. He made me another sculpture too, that I bought from overseas, but you know what I'm saying

not saying: you're a nazi

family think because I had one notch

party member metal yeah.

It will be on the news today. Jones admits he has not see stuff. No, it's free.

An interesting man. It is. This is from a battlefield dug up of dead people can't couldn't

We get more interesting and you take darkness and light



comes out of it. You make evil become good. I mean, if you talk to the artist Scott, I'm doing a huge blood for about how this guy doesn't know. Shit. Look at this guy's stuff. Look at that eagle! Go back to the

a bird with the fucking cylinders with the

is that what it is. First,

the top of his shoulders,

The tablet shows another car cylinder. That's a car cylinder yeah, that's a polish down car,

cylinder and then bayonets for they wanted me to be a product placement because they're trying to shut me down infomercial calm, it's an incredible product, just artist, men he's a great art. I brought this up because I walked in here, and I said God stoked

that is amazing and and you to took

like they dig up that know these battlefields in France and stuff, and then people get this

that's a rotting.

German helmet. Then you put light in and it makes it beautiful and it takes the evil of Hitler and makes it beautiful yeah, not Hitler

takes humanity and makes it beautiful, yeah it's, but but it is interesting that you can't

oh not you could never own a nazi flag or any



but you could watch the school studying here. Is that both my grandfathers not brag about family but remember Tom Landry? My grandfather was

UT. Football won state championships and track all of my mom's dad

he went the Army air Corps with Tom Landry

ever being over there on Sundays. He before he played the Dallas cattle he liked Tom Lehman called they pray for five minutes, both my grandfathers about Jerry Jones and and and and I'm in my you know us

mother mother's father, Mr Hammond. All

most died in a crash landing and another deal. I almost died

almost exist

my family, America fought Hitler,

and then now I'm a Nazi, because I believe in the second amendment

I believe in america- that's not fair! Well, that's not,

What they're saying they're saying, because you had a nazi piece of memorabilia, but it still doesn't make any sense, doesn't make any sense. You look if I saw some cool.

Will not see thing at some place where I could buy it. I might buy it and frame it 'cause, it's just.



Piece of history. Just like I would buy a Gangus Khan Dagger or a helmet. Oh my

Eddie Bravo's here

Christ,

now we earlier were having a great time talking about

and two dimensional beings is this and I also brought a check you out with the sure. Not so

any you know want to make you regret wearing this fucking shirt.

In high school we used to show each other out. That's like a gym, God. Chuck me out

No! No! No edit! Don't please don't chuckle unconscious. So now, please great

He can't be. Oh, you know, you think. I'm afraid of this was no. I definitely don't think you're afraid of this, which is why I don't want him to do it. You know not be pussy shut me up. You know what let me tell you a story. First, let me tell you a story for back when I used to

work at the Strip club you're, the one holding

I'm afraid Alex sit down. Please please, please.



We have to work together here. Work together,

have a Sutter choke me out Alex please, please how sweet it was high school. I know you did you told me, you grab each other and you fall down and hit your heads. It only takes like twenty

What were you going to say about Strip Club back when I was

it's a blue belt, nice

two hundred and ninety five, I at a strip club- and there was this-

girl I was dating. You never had any other. She was a bartender. She was seriously four foot ten and she will bartenders and waitresses, always the brazilian Strip clubs. I don't know yet let him I will she was. She was ninety two dot: zero bar ten,

the smallest girl and I showed her how to do a rear naked or she was

tiny, her name is Kimmy and the Strip

the manager. Was your size big, like used to be buffed but fast



yeah, but used to be, but you can't tell you to be a football player type big manager. You know you want those guys that manage strip clubs. You know intimidating, looking big dudes and he had a

corvette and he didn't believe

digits at all, and she said

He said if she choke me out with one of them. Jujitsu moves I'll, give

the keys to my core van so

she had to literally get on a bar, stool and

she was standing on- a bar stool had to go around and she would like that anyway. Just like this

and and then he went out lights out. He dropped like a sack of.

Does he hit his head on the fucking floor

impact the impact

head hitting the floor, woke his ass up, so we the ground and

pops back up



even know what the fuck happened was just sitting there going? Do you know whatever I thought he thanked, but any that's what I'm getting it like? People usually don't hit the ground pop back up. Usually they hit the ground there done and they need an ambulance, but he pop right back up. Is that what happened like bitch?

you need to give her your corvette Papa? It was. Ah, this was a thing I know about this about seventh grade during lunch, so the kids would

help each other out. You put your hands up on their neck kids

don't do this. I'm not teaching like God put onto this week- and I are doing this, but then there's like the cheerleaders wanted to be shown

and they were showing us how to bleed it out screen. Where did you go to school?

where did bill gates go to school? Where did bill looks good he's not bill Hicks bright. Now we already went over this. This guys talk about that. You know the crazy thing is. You can put together a case where you fucking, you believe here wave no, but they just saw bill. Hicks live known, Alex, since just



a few years after buildings going to see all you gotta see, there's old, wait, there's a bunch of old pictures separation because you and I work with somebody that work with him. We work with thousands of people. Suddenly it's like! Oh, we do the same person it's over. All you gotta do is just show those pictures of you like I'm like bill. Hicks is never twenty onyok. You are you all checked. You were like a body built and I should run things that we should get that zone again. You can. I got in this show where I ran six miles every other day and I lifted weights people go

should be bigger to workout three hours. I was addicted and

then I got on radio and tv and like sort of drinking and just stopped. It didn't work out for like ten years,

like one hundred pounds Alex. Let's get you

on something where we actually like put it online and talk about what you're doing. If you can

to something online like that you'll do it. All you have to

do is like set of realistic goal. I usually do forty pull ups and not going to like two hundred and forty.

Like Crossfit type or use your whole body, and everything were yes, amazing you're like doing the warning amazing,



problem was I used to go to all you can eat buffet

that's amazing to Chinese and I don't believe, Mandan Regular and the problems I would literally like order. I don't know, I don't want that. What do you think about

Yes, what you think about a self improvement thing that you do online when you do it online. I need to do

problems. Every time I try to workout the phones ringing and it's like oh shit. Let's listen! You just get up earlier, get up an hour and a half earlier, I'm going to river my torn bicep. Well, once you have surgery for bicep and everything gets fixed, I think once you get your bicep torn you're, probably going to be a little bit out of action,

not all these six months! No, you know what Novitsky had it done. It's fucking amazing I had my bicep done, but to

shoulder to the bicep to the elbow to the no no

you have be choked up we're talking fricking one hundred million years number, one dot zero; no, no! No! No! No! No! No! No,



there's no need to choke. You try to steal me and shit. This is one of those things that I swapped it up and jumped out once we once we made up on the phone. One of the first things you want to do is choke him out in the air

No, you might need to go to the Smn in the pain. When you get choked out you like go somewhere.

Will dream and then come right back like DMT

that said James on point: let's get serious, let's get

Let me just say a few things where he goes down this road. Okay,

What of the rope going down all right? We were just talking about. You know what the road is talking about. George Soros! No! No. We passed that we just talking about,

talking about the Strip Club, the guy choking the girl, the girl truck in the guy out the guy and hitting his head and then what happened after that? Any ideas, Jamie, no one, wants



before that. One of that I remember one time I got choked out. I remember hating babies. I remember it was cool. I don't think I've ever been to completely out for a second, the first time I got choked it was like this seventeen year old Super.

Chick, and I was like thirteen

tied up. She lived down the street. She goes

I got permission, sounds pretty on twelve

I'll, have sex with you. Is it true story, I'll

sex with you. If you, let me put makeup on

everything, show the girl puts the makeup on have sex wither and cheese.

And like a week later, she goes. She goes now, I'm going to choke you up

That relationship went really well until, like thirty year old boyfriend caught me at her place

because your mom was working and trying to kill me in the parking lot. Oh my god,

of sexually you put make up on you a letter full deal,



you listen. Your wise, wise man should know, but you just have like a clown. Always here's some of the things I and we can go forever. Yes, goes.

Not conspiracies, but real world programs developing a breakaway civilization. What is a breakaway civilization? You understand that it's the key to everything, uh

Guys, total surveillance control grid the power despised,

control, human animal hybrids, recover that mass farming of humanoid tissue Trans, human endgame coming multilayered, binary weapon delivery systems. That's when we haven't had what's that. Well,

I'm get into some of that. The pain is five

g, behavioral modifications. We hit that Trojan

delivery system. Cell phones, vaccines, GMO

contested designed to hurt you again. Vaccines are real. You can give somebody something gives him the cure, another disease that yet get but they're jacking it like a cell phone



stuff, your ticket to immortality. What do you think? Let's cover that? What do you think is happening with vaccines? I know

okay. Tell me what's going on, you've always used this because everyone's heard of it

heard about one thousand nine hundred and forty seven to nineteen

eighty three and only came

public, because the program

in Peru and promote

doesn't West Virginia, but the media picked up. It was white on black, not all the white people have to don't black or white, injecting

over a one million people with live syphilis in the,

so vaccines, you know, but to ski. Do you know about that?

but he you only know about Alabama and over forty something years only injecting blacks,

but it happened all the world search engine hill.

Clinton apologizes for apologizes,

most experiments in Tuskegee,

it was it. It was in Peru. Can I ask you this: was the Tuskegee was the arm the convention,



full story that they had syphilis

weren't really curing them? That's a cover

Is that what they say you know if you actually, they were giving.

I understand what you're saying, but was the the the

regional explanation of what happened was that that they knew that?

He had it and they allowed them. That was returned. Overtraining came out. Ok have you heard about here. It is right here us apart,

As for Guatemala S, T d X, yeah, they're, they're, they're, all different one, just type Perla medical hold on get to principle, to make that a little go

scroll up. So read Us

Formant medical researchers intentionally infected hundreds of people in Guatemala, including institution

noise, mental patients with gonorrhea and syphilis

without their knowledge or permission more than

sixty years ago, Jesus Christ.



When you've read, is what I do is Jesus Christ. Look at this. Many of those infected were encouraged to pass.

The infection is as part of the study. Where does this

What is the time here? Kill message, NBC News, imagine finding out you have syphilis, but you've never had sex before. Let me stop. Let me show you imagine how confused you ready for another ultra secret since is forty six to one one thousand, nine hundred and forty six, two sorry

four sixty one thousand nine hundred and forty eight

that's why I watch that's, not okay, it's not two years. Okay, so so so makes me

then imagine what's happened. Okay

we had a real liberal media in this country. They weren't leftists. That's occultic, that's different

we had a real liberal media in this country that had problems, but they really cared.

Reminded like when I said focused on information here is, after I prove Delta force was in Seattle in nineteen. Ninety nine and prove that they also



Alex Jones is right. It's incredible! That's the WTO tape that I always cite the type that will you show the agent Provoca tours, went into a peaceful protest and started smashing windows and I'm not against the army but Delta Force random

there's always go down. The armies. Terrorists, like you said, don't call the whole government group

yeah that they changed it

so imagine used to the press would get a lot of stuff right, but-

they would get demoted or whatever Trump got in which

and I got Trump things good, but I almost think like good

physical. They put him in on it, piss everybody off to get the Libre

super traditionally been the real watch dogs for free speech and it gets human

fermentation, and

certainly there like in Gallup polls, we love war. We love experimentation, we love everything, getting chills right now and so imagine Joe,

I've been on air for twenty three years and I'm a new sound. I spend four five hours. A reading news

I don't believe NBC News that our government gave people notice, I



dead Peru, because that was a big document in case you just found Guatemala.

Track of this the track everywhere. This went on to the everywhere still going on so imagine

Imagine I have, literally by the time sandy hook him.

I've literally seen

ten thousand articles and documents are more where they're admitting

in one thousand nine hundred and sixty two, the joint chiefs of staff under limits or K.

President Kennedy. This is on PBS and said we

blow up buildings, shoot up schools and movie theaters and bomb. Your army bases a marine bases. I'm going to have people with their kids with

Name change that CIA get on a jumbo jet that takes off it gets blown

over the Caribbean. We blame Cuba but

that plane really lands and there's another plane. That's a drone we blow up, and

Kennedy says no, but his brother says no I'll do it while they killed Kennedy.



Does Bobby said he would, but then he got pissed when they killed his brother sold declassified. He wanted to bomb the Han

Aaron an embassy and blow up

about go to war with Moscow. Bobby Bobby was bad

this. Is you pull this up? Pull up Bobby Kennedy?

to bomb the US embassy in Honduras. This is

classified and so imagine use

the hundreds of these

and then a sandy hook happens in your listeners, don't buy it and then it's

psychosis were then well because

every man I knew about. This is apathetically, but it's was great. Every man I knew when I was a kid back handed me and beat the crap out.

So men are bad or a woman's been raped,

which takes all internet. So I get like

this psychosis and I'm not gonna, put myself down like I'm a victim, I'm being honest retrospectively that got to wear when I learned that so much stuff was false. Then

later I experienced where I had the guest, I did

thing I knew it was true, and then



People made up the whole story because they don't believe anything anymore. So that's what I'm trying to say do you think it part of it?

Is that, even though this stuff does exist, it's almost like there's too many things happening for one person to pay attention to all of them and if your own

focus on a shuttle overload. Yes, well, if you're only but hold on. If you're, only focusing on that aspect of life, it can be incredibly overwhelming because you start thinking, that's the whole world, the whole world, these conspiracies because he's

things are concentrating on primarily

Is this what I'm saying that she is

we just talked about operation Northwoods that whole thing that was operation Northwoods there, that is some

ABC that's about it, that's true, clear, great, clear, standout Brooklyn, but if you break it down and you look at it, you look at operation northwoods. You look at that shit that is about as gay

inkster and sinister and evil. You

went over just a little while ago we were going into early before you got. My point is: if you believe that



no other conspiracy theory, whether the right or wrong, like government conspiracy should be ridiculed. You shouldn't there

They should be all right. Thank you, you're right. You should, instead of looking at him with river to cool, you should look at him objectively and the band exactly and the only the only people that have a right to ridicule. Conspiracy theories are people

don't believe in any conspiracy theories. If you don't believe in any of them.

Yes, I understand why you're ridiculing killing people all the time, what some of them

you believe in some of them

the other ones. You don't believe them. I think

should be more.

I don't believe in that shit, but I understand why my defense all know

we probably just running court, I'm looking forward to trial in Texas and in Connecticut

I it on the lawyers already agreed, I'm going to sit there,

gonna show them history and all these things these say like I



watch the already been out for like a year or two, but I watch the minions.

Rear, Bore, and it's like this

sixties and they break on this.

Of Hollywood in the moon, landings being staged,

magazine for their family, but

I believe in western outside

we're going to hit a minute, wait astronauts done, which ones? Oh space, shuttle

we're gonna talk about. No, no, the Johnson the House from the APOLLO one had with one well, not really. Yes, they were practicing a class. Those were to get to this next and I

I respect you, but I want you guys to yell at each other for three minutes. While I go pee, I gotta pee too. Okay, as you don't talk to yourself, just hold will do in ship. Should I go first,

okay, anyways. You know what I'm saying your bad questioning. I get it now. You do

you know why, because you



No, I work this jug for golf course of course, of course, of course Alex

you you are someone that I could talk to about the flat earth conspiracy.

And you believe in so many crazy things about the government. You, don't you,

don't you don't believe in flat, but

you can kind of understand where I'm coming from

right: yeah right issues, GPS, Israel. I know,

pilots that fly from California to uh places like

Traglia and they've got another wing over to Hong Kong and then they go to Monica and you can fly anywhere in the world if it was flat, it was flat as you could go from e to West. Just like you,

a ball, you just don't understand what a like a

you can just go anywhere like if you're

wanna flowers when I'm telling a flatter, but I'm sure you could travel anywhere. Give me



two cities. The point of two cities in which we don't like to so much I get what you got nothing to do with the best, I'm not that right now, but I do have the money, I'm not trying to convince you, I'm not trying to convince you Alex. My point is my: take you gotta find it on your fucking.

There's no way you're going to be convinced. No no one has ever been can was we're going to make a statement they they have to really find it within themselves and and do some

I understand what I'm telling you soul, search. What, if I finance a research ship large ship and make a documentary, I can't go over,

I will pay for.

You three months, I'm not b s ing! You know me,

having money, not a big deal, so we can do cool things with it, one, how much money can you write?



I have to go to the south. Well, we're gonna need we're. Gonna need uh, you guys going to the moon or in orbit right now going through each other. Okay, you raise the money for a trip to raise the money, not the money. Okay, you come on the money Theo, this the deal, Gopi, Gopi Man, you're, gonna, go, say: you're. Sorry, oh plan going whoa,



who is the ambassador for player? He's the ambassador, I gotta say him swear, get astronauts me the guy that Disco Peyman the big ice fields that guy's going to be this is what they were going to Alex out. This will get you when you give me Tom, show me twenty seven, an entire crew during command. You are going to the edge of the flat earth total, but it's not going to be me. I'm going to I'm going to designate somebody. I'm too scared, so we're going to do this. We're going to do this, Joe Rogan! No, no! We're going to do this job to send someone else, you're going to find the edge of the world babies caps. Caps there knocking film the drop off with my Iphone.

Don't be mad, hoping he have

so we're going to send someone else Alex we're going to do you know what we're going to do this to be the one that goes in a minute, I'm right! Now, I'm right now

I came here and I proved there keeping babies alive and taking their. How did you prove that Jamie pulled? They admitted them,



Normalizing it? No, the fuck, the governor.

You really did.

Do you really think

There's people out there campaigning for late term abortions. You think that's it's real!

throated Monday to keep it cool? Who would campaign?



You can fuckinget men, they're, fucking, Kelly, already more kids, so you're telling me it isn't really what I had a fucking vote in the goddamn fucking said it. That's a conspiracy theory right way: fucking top you're about to get their killing. Forty four babies stop fucking lying got fucking dad I'm getting past now, don't get best. No, I saw the video right now. If I was fucking with the Senate voted to kill babies. Let me have your fucking barred playing with course. I believe that Alex, of course, I believe,



adding all over the noon. Anyways just plan ahead. He let me explain to you, won't. Let me explain to you. We went into a long conversation we played. I heard it. I heard it. I heard the whole podcast of years chasing playing with you imagine my psychosis is their reality is so crazy that I always thought I was so tough simply doesn't have to pee anymore. This little bit point is. The point is, is that the point is: is that dude? I'm not

the reality so crazy. Why are we debating whether the earth is flat? Do they're keeping they have human animal hybrids? There's there's a freaking. I have been there when people that work for the

Pentagon say that they? We go the laboratory and we meet with the ambassador. We have to take higher

higher doses is to meet with them they're, giving us technology and the technology works

is going on. Do you want to know this listen, relax



think about space isn't real freaking dimensions, man, the aliens cover that imagine Alex think about what I said I said to do. You think, there's actually people out.

Where did believe other cat there?

campaigning for twenty thousand dollars, central telescopes, where I can look at various issues? Listen to what I said. She's fighting with this fucking with you said: do you think there's actually people out there that are campaigning for late term abortions? Of course there are, but I'm making it seem like. I don't believe they are get out, I'm being the ultimate skeptic, I'm being the ultimate skeptics in anything. He does that all the time he's just

be yours of enemy right there I'm threatened, I'm not Mr Goody, two shoes by them, keeping babies alive and killing him, and that nobody cares. I fundamentally

that's what I'm saying I'm being honest here. Is I'm not like certifiably crazy, but I deal with this



all day long I get what Joe Trust shot away and people go crazy doing. No. Why did I never saw that clip of that guy saying that they would resuscitate the babies and then they would make a decision. I heard about that New York bill that they're trying to have me. Oh, it's like it's like a goddamn city, it's worse than God, they're, giving a bunch of goddamn fucking organ harvesting, doctors, control outside of law. You hurt that piece of shit, fucking, K, K, K, guy fucking governor, say we're. Gonna

people live after their fucking born because they wanna fuck it take their organs. It's incredible he's a k, K K.

That's incredibly cool fun! It's so that I incredible a picture with a guy k, K, K outfit in blackface. They elected him because he's black males they had that shit and when he messed up instead

keep him alive to get their fucking organs. They use that to deactivate it



Do you think fraternities have you screw sheep and all this and you know, give guys blowjobs, that's whatever join them, because they want to come and go back. Go back through that again,

okay,

I'm so happily side do this podcast, so she turned out you're up fucking amazing. It was a good pen who fucking world order,

also do it. Did you got so pissed off, I'm so glad I fucked it through.

Got some to do my wife, how many jre clips they're going to make that shit. Do they're going to they're going to put you to music cheese, pulled up MIT, saying they got animal human pigs yeah we did, we did go, take a leak, I'm with you, this man, you just kind of freaked me out about several



Jax no bullshit. He freaked me out about several subjects. There's people out there campaigning for the record that article says that there was no written data on that that came from three interviews. They had

so this is a human pig one that people were saying that to them.

They tried it. Why wouldn't they try it if you were

If you were the leader of the free world like didn't,

Wasn't there some God damn it was.

The nazis that were they were true

to theorize how to combine humans with animals to make a stronger human.

Wasn't there, some of that they were for sure into that. Was there something like that?

If there's a Youtube link that

that's for sure right like for sure they've they've. Definitely I mean, I think, all governments,

definitely give their soldier steroids, they definitely give them in feta means they get definitely give them camera.



Is to make the crazy should? I would are you kidding, that's where they started to run any fucking army, the, not see nothing oz, rather the kamikazes. That

would I'm up

I'm pretty sure. That's true, read that

one percent on Youtube, yeah, that that was one of the ways

I would get them not just like nationalism and pride for the country. They would do would jack him up on Crystal Meth and that's why they fly that plane right into that fuck

boat boom,

the nutty thing to do man you got to be, you got to be in a weird state

mine and you got to have such a horrible life there. I fuck it let

this crash into this fucking boat right,

the general and they're like happy about that. I can't wait to escape this shit. What insane choice

that's the only pc has is when he's in that plane, killing people what I fucking crazy choice that you're gonna do that, for you Alex welcome back we're talking about



houses, we're saying that we think kamikazes were that was they gave him crystal meth.

It was not a part of the program yeah I mean war, always drugs

and the the the Japanese learned about

in World WAR Ii, they're, actually on our side against Russia going back and forth they.

In the World WAR, one. The Japanese learn about msg could Japanese, like good food,

The military, wouldn't complain. They've just lose weight started death,

so they learned they were fighting the Russians

in world war. One

just go ahead and give machine

does your brain. Everything is super toxic, and so you

mono sodium glutamate like this stuff from chinese food, is that we were saying super freaking, toxic yeah, but we really

but beyond that, yes, they would give them well. The Germans were

on steroids and methamphetamine,

we're just saying that,

but it's not what is it



just mainline history stuff by the way I said, I give you the secrets of Hitler. Their secrets,

but this is not to be yes, this is the real thing. How do you know, though, who's telling you this stuff

you classified, classify today beyond classify daddy,

no, I mean Alex seriously overthink. Ok, 'cause, you have a lot of you. Have a lot of small grand Father was german in Dallas.

Work for a the inventor of indoor air conditioning was a billionaire in.

Area Dallas, where the Republicans all live same in that place.

No, it's not our like. It's that's the thing right there in the middle of Dallas.

So what you think? That's awesome, you think Dallas is like all buildings.

Huge park and, like all these big mansions anyways, he lived up there and it was just for Ma'Am. You know I've as I'm not going to get into the



The point is, is that Hitler was on the cover of time magazine and- and he wants true unless

The photo shop that I saw on the internet I want twice will Trump was on the cover of time magazine two

actually not really. The problem is fairly give you guys that affect he made his own more. Should I or should I just give up,

like a boil down. Here's the thing it wasn't.

My grandfather was these other people.

My grandfather said it was really confusing for him, because

He worked for this guy, that was in refrigeration and air conditioning when he was in

school and his dad on the car dealerships in Dallas and stuff. They live there. The rich area, Dallas

What did they tell you? Well,

one reason he wanted in the by the Time World WAR two started to drop out of beauty, and you know all that again to go, join the

Eric or so you tell me all this stuff. I want to your grand father is a little eccentric. Now, like my grandmother, New Werner

RON when he came down instead of what yeah yeah.

Show. Anyway, you go



Grandpa, New Warner VON Braun, both went to, I came in Yahoo. You with the event

Ok, that's the point. Is I'm getting too well 'cause? They were like German. No wonder you believe in the moon landing. I get it now.

Didn't make sense to say him finish store. My families was what they called high german

and so the hot yeah, that's what that is. Luber mentioned so

only would talk, people that were in the club- oh shit, ok, yeah, so so anyways,

Grand Father, and then it was like an uber mentioned and

no. You hire q, the whole nine yards show he was working with this german guy and he would just go over there.

After school work was apprentice and my grandfather was

will get more and more depressed and more crazy by the end of the 30s and the guy should fight him. He said he said

Climate, my grandmother's name, he said you had the Nazis. Had my

family in Germany, they're going to kill 'em, all



but I'm having to give him everything. I got all my money and I'm having to sell the patents and work like that were like twenty hours a day, giving everything he had because they're going to his family in Nazi Germany, he was german

and so my grandfather wouldn't in the Army AIR Corps defied Hitler because he had that

and he was so mad. I was a kid was like when I was a kid in Dallas

ab. Ap had Hitler. Speeches on 'cause Germans are a big part of the US

and it was the boon that I was supposed to join it and and Hitler was good

and we never really bought into it. And then I found out that this mentor of mine miscalculate build

today had everything he had sucked out of him by the Nazis. So that's what the Nazis would would do was extort.

And control, so I kind of heard about that. Then I'd rather go

so they see me down there like a week during the summer, and I was like eight years old, I'm hearing this he's like mom, ran as the plan for this orbital spacecraft landed and grab the young guard

gravity systems and I'm hearing all the seven like markers the table like talking about it and I'm sitting there

listening to this, and he would talk about yeah



that I was at least sound for you know Texaco

the only place to get chicken fried steak out in Mexico or West Texas was a military base. All these God, damn not Season

You know one time I didn't want to do it, but that guy's smarted off about how they had bore better shoot,

in our planes down, so I went ahead.

Ran his head right through the wall and I never knew what happened

For that side you just gotta, kill Nazis and the son of a bitch. Is our government brought in thousands of those assholes and- and I'm

listen to this, I'm like I'm, going to read about Nazis. It's how about ten. I start buying books

into a bookstore, and I want my cop. They are you a nazi like reading

Hitler's my struggle. No I'm not announcing my both. My grand

Father's, told me how bad Nazis were and both almost died fighting nazis. So I wanted to know about Nazis

It was this whole ethos, and so that's just

whole story of

standing that at my dad's angle,

father's angle of their impression paper clip

they didn't call it paper clip. He said our government brought those he



I think he would always say well, but that's the I think there was several waves there was that thirty.

Thousand of either

a lot of fucking Nazi brought over on Youtube. It says the operation paperclip was anywhere from like one thousand two hundred to fifteen

search the total number of admitted congressional hearings.

Teen 70s, Frank Church Committee in the seventies, released it only the numbers. Thirty

Four thousand two hundred and seven looking up, there's

Like I told you that gay several you pulled it out, but it is fascinating. They,

are those people over here and that's where the the space program came from.

Well, that's why I wore the shirt not as a sick joke.

I already have the CIA that was Lss

The CIA is O S s, that's all on record. Okay, I'm glad you

don't see how it is SS again office of special plans,

that was before the CIA, and then the CIA came up sort of like



the office of strategic services like what was

for the seals with Jesse Ventura was you know the answer honestly materials and that he was at auxiliary the navy. He would never come back,

expand on that.

But the osset the office of now.

Miracles? The OSS was british intelligence, are the most powerful british, most powerful intelligence agency ever they.

Set up bright house at twenty two after World war, two to anglicize the US with british intelligence, not a british intelligence, take over a marriage salt. This is like on PBS this stuff. It's true, though,

same thing: only academics are watching us it'll tell the truth. The general pop culture's all crap meant to be dumped.

How much would turn you off but

go to the real academic stuff on the old days of frontline and stuff, like

watch that it was true later at the documents, all it's all real, like those like really accurately Bobby Kennedy,

I bought. The embassy in Honduras,



I do not see well Warner VON Braun. Isn't it isn't it weird?

one man who directed all six moon missions was a Nazi,

with Brian over one. Isn't that crazy guy smoke weed and one guys having a problem. His memory two guys did

You want to defend wonderful, hey, I'm not defending him. Yeah, that's fine! Not to use- and I know she does read about it. He sketched for Hitler. This plan to drop atomic bombs that they had

developed when you see red skull, Marvel Comic. We've got a big bomb

I love New York, it wasn't a bomber, it was a space plane and it was about half the size but looks just like this and

mons. Actually, some of their signs, one of the Russians, the Russians tried to build their space. Charlotte was half a size that was actually the german plan. So so

you look it up, because the Russians took a lot of Germans as well correct about one slash of the the so look



The reason I'm wearing this is explained. This is a gateway all of it. So you have

intelligence

one World war war. You know Germany,

way. More advanced technology

then take over british Intel.

Just basically merges with the US,

the Germans and others say: we've got to go way ahead in technology. Was

in labs, but they could match deploy. They didn't have enough machine shops and systems to build it, and you

special forces, went on suicide missions and blew up the underground mountain. How about the Nazis were the first to bill?

flying saucer, all it. That's crazy

not a Quinto british intelligence, british in

Paula Jones.

Flying saucers,

forty seven

So now the Nazis are over. Here they go. Listen, you don't want them running everything and they go to Eisenhower and they say we want to launch a off babe.



Breakaway civilization, where you compartmentalize things forget empires,

You have a new ruling class of technological elites and then

The elites are all in charge, the public's watching tv and will give him widgets, and

nation series type things to viruses. All the documents and

under an empire will build a whole new empire, and so I

power gives a speech worry about it.

The military accomplish. He says the technological elite watch, the full.

One minute speeches farewell address is sixty two. He says

six hundred and sixty one, he said

You need to

watch out about the scientists because, because he

made note the national plan when he found,

but it wash what is it

away civilization where

try to run the whole planet

off resources and build a whole new advanced system, and then you player

off against each other and collapse it. So when I say what is a, if we could take NASA back over

it's bigger than the CIA. It's the real government, the space



steps in the stuff. That's all pr NASA is the real government NASA

breakaway governments to shadow governments

in the documents, and so you had one that was british run

and the Germans came to our own US elites and said hey. You always need a couple plants

they said, we've got all this on the drawing board, the EU a plan to poison the food

order to get rid of the dumb people, a plan for off world bases. We've got

by the way we're taking hardcore drugs or in contact with aliens. How was thinking that it was the Germans first got in touch how they do it:



never really Russia, a cold branch really easily called on all the any everyone which is around him at all times. You know human sacrifice, I don't know, there's a lot of the thrill society. What I am telling you Joe, this is not me, you go the real, deep phd level history, books. Okay, NASA is the german breakaway government, just always the Germans, the branch

for dominance. Okay, so what you're saying is when operation paperclip acquired all those nazi scientists, they essentially started running NASA, so NASA became.

Turn an offshoot of the german government. This offshoot government yeah the Germans had

all the wealth away. They had everything.

They made example really makes sense, though, that in twenty nineteen that's still going on. No, no, no, no, the british intelligence

On the c I a today the british empire

it was under attack and just bankrupted itself in world war. One, it said will give you the keys of the kingdom



Are they in the shed for the English speaking peoples? He was half american and this is officially in books. We merge with the british empire in like one thousand nine hundred and thirty two.

Okay, that's what the CFR is. Is british intelligence in US intelligence, so the

runs the show okay, so you've got you've, got german intelligence,

You don't need to do all this. We haven't given the real technology, we're in contact with aliens and then tell

where you getting this from you stating so confidently. It's in the literature man, Hitler like would go

mainline historical books about mainstream SS castles where they go. The aliens want blood, so they kill like twenty kids and everything that the aliens like coming in taking the bloody brings him in like sharks, and then they

What does technology they go? This is how it works. You build the atomic weapons this way he built that they would like



Some bombers like the aliens are like telepathic. I don't even believe this is with an ugly

and aliens with mind meld and given the technology they're bad aliens. So they are. You surprised the Nazis were influenced by demons.

No, if demons real, definitely think they'd be on the side of the Nazis.

What I'm telling you is they'll, be no immediate! No media is going to attack this.

I'm giving you to know where I can read it, where can I read that those statements?

contact with the I will always your pockets of real society. V, r l, if you let me, pull up a chair because it really means that they don't like right up there with the like doing average over three hours. If I,

with the report,

I'll, send it all to you with mainline books, also mail mill, the books with the tabs in ok and I'll mail documents. Okay, cool yeah,.



I'll listen. I think that they were absolutely obsessed with the occult that's been pretty well documented, made flying saucer, yes, and I think yeah and I think many many governments they developed a more advanced form of nuclear fuel. Heavy water

and we had to sit in special forces on suicide missions. Back was really special forces to blow it up

and I'm telling you- the germans- had all sorts

event. They just couldn't ever keep the plants from getting blown up because they were a few years behind yeah and by and by the way church

wrote about this in his memoirs and said the Germans were way ahead. It wasn't. The Germans were bad. That is not your bad, but it wasn't that it wasn't the

germans that first bomb civilian targets in nineteen

forty one, the

we're losing the war. Hitler was bombed

for medical facilities, military facilities and, and so they went and bombed german

towns and german cities like



the famous german city, Dresden, what was

safe city for kids? Half a million people died in one night to trick

to turn his bombers on the general population. They

psychologically. Do it, but but but but Churchill this is been classified, it's it's an esoteric.

It should made it so Hitler was set up. Well, it was bad, but here's what happened. Albert Speer was his chief. Our motion, architects, minister and british double agent. Rudolf Hess was the deputy for

They got Hitler totally love, but you never hear about him since one thousand nine hundred and forty one 'cause, they had a peace treaty with Edward. The eighth, who was the king of

one who was a nazi and it was german first family, german and they had a deal

to stage the attack. The French stood down, Vichy French didn't fight, they put they put nazi occupiers in the the Dunkirk operation was allowed to evacuate and Edward the eighth,



then super peace through Peace Chamberlain, but it's

come out that it was all set up by Churchill and others. Not they ran Hitler, not they weren't bad they're, pretty good, but they match

manipulated him and

never Chamberlain, all of them and bet on the british people in America to come in. They had deals with with.

To then bring us into the war, and that was the whole master plan,

go to the history and see all

that's. What's so incredible Joe when you, when you you

have all this info, and so rude

has in nineteen forty one four

two, he flies a one man by

he was a world war. One fighter ace like the number three eight or not aircraft. Look it up. Rudolph s

he flies in parachutes into the

castle, the king was in at the time in like Northern,

whatever the name of it. He

two hundred with the peace treaty signed by the king of England,



lock him up in the tower for the rest of his life in London and ever the eight had to advocate type in

Hitler and you'll see him in videos, films and photos,

was in Spain, world war, two started: where do you think the contact with the aliens came from where, when did that start?

This is the most important they were not aliens learn hold on interdimensional aliens.

Alien means anything out of this world. What, when was when did that happen? That ice gets that mother vodka loose? No,

it's fake. I need to hear about aliens

yeah and we still crazy batch. You know it's crazy about aliens. Is it Utah

who made a big announcement that they're going to go after a nine hundred and eleven videos. Anything up. I don't know this is true. I don't know, but



Is it true that there demonetizing any videos that have truth or liberty? In am yes? That's true? Yes, but I don't know if that's true, but I heard that well, that sounds crazy. Interesting offer discussions building. Let me finish. Let me finish real, quick,

it's crazy how they're going after nine and eleven miracle cures? Father fuck, but there blowing up alien video

their power life is wonderful, strongest, monetized, videos out there. I don't know, but it's true the stronger. It is well there's a lot of

is out there looking the best deals in the best way that the top top of the line,

exposed I'll tell you when it is right. I actually know the numbers to blow it up.

Only in video there's a little kid who makes twenty two million dollars a year reviewing toys? No! No! That's like the number one hit.

One of the number one guys on Youtube? It's like eight, I'm saying



alien videos get monetize Irvine high level. You know wind bouncers, the high level, because I was right there. Okay, they're, not they're, not offensive people get drawn into with every one of them is currently set up. Why did they

shut my shit down, 'cause they're, talking about that the government is lying and covering honey. 'cause. It's funny

But it's terribly right: how did the connection with alien start? You said this is the most important thing we discussed on the podcast and Eddie. I love you to death and you're awesome. That's why I,

she'll be here. If you want to believe in aliens I'm cool with that, I still love you. I don't care, I don't care about that. Listen! This is not what I believe. I love you for who you

I'm trying to tell you something, listen man! Let me tell you something: let me take some okay, I'm not making this stuff up.

I believe you believe it. No.

If I told you earlier about my dad the table being offered. Half a million dollar

one thousand nine hundred and eighty chevy that build cyborgs in Merrillville? He wasn't here. For that part, he came in late



tell me how the connection with aliens got started with

connection aliens did not trees. When people started becoming obsessed with contact with the aliens, he was saying, the nineteen forty seven

some sort of a connection. You know right. They

youtube in mainstream media, like they always thought it was safe. I talk to

but Federal reserve the new world order. I want some big show as long as they make the aliens in with it and he was never the alien guy right.

The big alien. Never you! You know what that's right

I remember when I was balls deep in aliens 'cause. I believed all that shit. I believe it used to be that you

conspiracy, theorists if you believe in aliens but not anymore. Now, if you believe in alienating this Israel's person, okay, but let let's tell me how the connection between aliens and the took place, wonder all the start. Let me let me begin. This is really a



without telling you this is a real deal. I believe you, this is you ask? Who are they? It's people

who are psychically genetically available

interface in this incredibly diverse

universe. With

all these dimensions above and below and all around us with consciousness is,

and the truth is no energies ever destroyed. It all continues on. The truth is our bodies is a fact or

hive organism

all of our ancestors and all of their race memories, but not,

and just some compressed epigenetic sis,

it's beyond that. It's an electrode

chemical antenna, they've proven this.

It connects to higher and lower dimensions. Show

body shoot, because our

our predecessors would put us in position without giving

there's a body should get his them. Our families are loving us, they're, holding us there wrapped all.

What is their strength or will their bad they're good their sins, the good things they did, the



They won the battles, they lost the woman, they love the man, they love, it's all

in us all. These people were able to look into so many things and have so many different experiences

And so all the shaman, all the ancient religions. Everybody says there are the good ones and there are the bad ones, and people are interfacing, so you say: where does it begin from the Tibetans

to the measure Americans to the Egyptians to the druids to every

society describes the same thing. There are bad

things that look like elves that have horns when they show you who they really are, and there are good things, but they don't

contact you unless you contact them and then they they're almost not even

what you're doing I never bought into this look

never going to think about what I hear when I was a kid? What did I see what was coming out government documents, what was being admitted when I read all

books about world war, two of the Nazis and Hitler obsessed,

the Dalai Lama and the Tibetans, and what they were able

without drugs to interface. With this and



all the rituals they would do and how they were believed that beyond the ether I get skull and bones is a german death cold. They do rituals ritual, take drugs to talk

the goddess is well they're just appear

sexy, beautiful women. It's whatever you want is the Spirit guy

because lower entities will come in

and violate your free will, God and his

angel which below him will not get in

solved in your everyday life. They will not

your free will, unless you ask them in, but the devil masquerade.

The light so we're on this planet, the third dimension, which is a launchpad all the other dimensions below and above

The third dimension, all that mathematics shows is. Is the primal

she of, where all the

tablets the earth like an egg and we've got all the

potentiality.

And God will sit out a transmission for a larger plan, but evil is willing to come in and what does it say to moralize? Get rid of shoulder, don't have kids. Humans are bad. You will be

be better once you're all gone, and it's because



operational mission for whatever reason that will understand later. What's going on so the Nazis, we get the deep literature, they believed

they were basically say on sing and being possessed by entities that I mean it was before the

ounces, for whatever reason was the Germans that this happened to and the like? They didn't discover LSD in the thirties

these. These people were running the psychology departments, they were interface

and with the occult they were involved in uh

all this crazy stuff- and it was all about

their power and how great they were going to be in the Germans were seduced and they were subdued.

Because they had high iqs, but more than that, they were psychically connected to each other and would work like robe

this Chinese and the EU want robots, replaces will follow, orders

the Chinese, are very calm

from the conscious, also very robotic, but the germ

their gestures robotics. So this entity system pick Germans

this attempt, even in world war, one world war two and it was amazing,

which, as well and offering



technologies, but two different paths. One was so

dual control and also their stuff with

the other, was high tech, weapons

systems interdimensional with the Germans, and so

these players are

until it was very dangerous. They're, manipulating the british arm,

the german arm and,

the chinese arm. That's almost

like you, robot at the robot army and and so when you study at the

published, go to these events and they take bigger and

doses of drugs that do Electro shot

owners of time, life books didn't work just in the twenties and thirties and lsd and other hallucinogens an apothecary. They were getting electroshock. They were

They were having people turn their heart off. To like try to communicate with these things too,

how to be dominant and get that. So you go back thousands of years,

Merlin in the archetypal or or or

magicians or these. These wizards are taking

drugs in these temples and interfacing. With these



hum tears. His crystal balls, which aren't really crystal ball

it's their psychic focus of internet

connection, while they're on drugs looking into glass to then be

able to see the future

and what's happening to give them to

little power over this planet. But, like the Bible, tells you

Pharmakis or any of that always leads to destruction. 'cause only evil is going to come through that way. So

we basically have these light, sockets

jack into the higher. Let's start free will, and that takes time we in to the evil.

So you can jack into evil. You can't jack into good right away, so it

quicker. It's easier like Yoda says about Darth Vader,

liquor easier, more seductive and so

I remember being a and and parents parents really

about this. Whatever they even know, they were here at the time, but they

add friends that they knew it Uti that were involved in and then and then they were not,

I about research projects in San Francisco

duty has some MIT has a lot anytime. You want but



This was in like the sixties. They had

virtual reality gloves where you'd put him on and put goggles on, and you go into stuff that look like the holodeck from STAR Trek twenty years, forty

tested and they were doing surgeries and all this, and they would do

empathy loads where they say we need the public.

Because we're so weak, because the west is so strong people have

that promise say, sold him low level over to create trauma like when you go to Mars, you're, not getting any gravity, so your heart still go when you get there. Organizing all this

Don't tell you know it's a special class you've been so in the sixty.

He's they had love.



Special class of people that are organizing all this shit is the highest scores, but is it for what purple you don't know financial gain social Jack Parsons was his jet propulsion laboratory, Alastair Crowley, Devil, worship exactly okay. So what so, you're saying that alley over one hundred years ago in those three aliens give the plant the founder of J Pierrot Jack Parsons. Have you heard this before? No, I just can't believe I didn't wanna have Alex on the party, but did you? Let me finish this. Just let me say take over, but I'm not bullshitting you

I'm telling you this stuff.

Don't believe in this. Ok there. It is right there

Sadly, no exactly so crazy.

After days of people, not just family



Winn, vibration, aromas, stereo, sound color, motion, wide vision and 3d, three dimensional, but let me tell you they wore

that was already like you see, like paper thin tv screens, and it was already.

I list so there's no way this was human technology, so you've seen these foldable phones, yeah yeah. I think the aliens have already too

over Samsung Samsung walk Huawei,

their ship

show show. So if you think the aliens are taking over SAM Sung, they have a some some to do a SAM Sung. Well, obviously, that's what I'm telling you is that the pen

John isn't worried about Jamie. This is the patent. Wow know

that's the week of the sixties. I believe one thousand nine hundred and fifty seven so notice. That's exactly what you're what

I told me, that's what are htc. Vive looks like that. We have in the foot today she got this big. My dad

tell me this.

We saw in game and he said no son. We



virtual reality goggles and we

Sheedy the and we had things and then something else happened and

I'm not at liberty to get into it, but I was shown three years ago what the university

Washington was doing under bill gates, and this is in the nineties. What were they doing? What do you think? They don't even know what they're being given its intervening us so

You think it's some sort of alien intervention type shit. They they they to get even deeper. They turn your heart off for five minutes and they pump oxygen in your blood.

And you're in the meetings I've talked to people that top scientist and

you're in the meetings with frickin aliens. Elvis is the main group, but there

by shutting your heart off. It makes you have that psychedelic experience by keeping blood in your oxygen.

It keeps you alive. Well, let's explain: okay, the heart goes out. The body thinks it's debt



so you can stay in longer. I don't know all the science behind it. I understand, but let's see

minus. Let me T or Iowa

two hundred times like most are astronauts of test are flying planes, those robots. Now it's all Mine WAR,

so these dudes are like it stops working once you've taken hundreds of times

so then they start taking their most psychic people who are

able to do this. They turn their heart off.

They put him into these these events and- and it's like the things

feelings tell him they come out. They tell scientist and it works show like we're. Gonna share. They didn't. Let me tell you killed for this stuff Joe. This is not the only thing that woman off here

this when I finally figured this out because I never touch aliens, I kind of knew the whole thing already,

when I was a kid weight: nine. Whatever it was this lady, this lady would come over that my parents and

beauty and was involved. She talk about yeah, we call the

Delic Research Institute of the name was

that's really a CIA deal, and you know we just can't



will it handle it. They're going in the else want this

and the elf want us to basically reduce population and agree with

certain plans and it's all of the humanization, and they call me Elsa, Clockwork House and they're like yeah

and I'm listen. My parents are like seven years old, like they don't think you're

and talking about. Well,

of the elves want. This is what they're going to do and the thing is it's not

that special. You know

much of San Francisco.

There is dude, it's a cult man. You know

these guys. You know from San Francisco, you look at look at the head of Google or Youtube or Freaking apple he's on.

V TIM Cook in his eyes. Are this big under lights? Man

you guys are on stuff that, like nobody even knows what do you think they're on stuff they've been given, I mean

people at UT. They won't tell me specific

They, like the doodle, owns Youtube who's. That guy, what's his name



girl you sexes, pay. No, no nobody likes them. It's anything on that company whose is or take take take puts all right. Do, there's not like a Jack Dorsey of you to take take take take some arbitrary. He goes

in two hours, I'm there he's the ceo of you,

who is the ceo of Google, Google. Sorry

he's literally on tv going. We never

fix the result we

it's found anybody.

There is no surveillance,

You've got all these old white men and I'm not saying white man to be

it's all a bunch old, dumb ass white man and a couple of dumb asshole mexican and black ladies they're all done because they are going

so you don't

control controlling. Meanwhile,

prospectus to their shareholders, how they control it all now they're going to deliver maximum profit, and

like yes, it is true. We have

control the search result and it's just

I'm just listening to paralyze. Meanwhile, this



only the front guy of Eric Schmidt and God knows what they're into their

has hasn't been proven that Google does something to to alter search results. I'm asking cause, I don't know not asking to fuck with

yeah yeah. I don't know what did they do? Google itself is about. If you pay them, they put results the top just like Facebook. Okay! Well that

definitely altering search results. So what he said was not true. If they,

if you can pay. It's like saying watering Wet Joe

I know you know all this stuff. No, no! No! I don't know that. I don't know that now. Listen

honest about what I don't know.

I know some things, but I there's a lot of fun

holes in my knowledge base. That's a fact! Well, you know that they try to block my name and directed toward negative stuff.

I'm sure they do. If only manipulate all they do. Is



All they do is the negative. You attack me. It's it's digital currency. You go to the top and they pay you money right.

So your body a little tip watching?

Let me lie about go to the to the top, but you lose. Your soul

want to burn this out, there's important stuff to cover aliens. So this is a good podcast

Okay recently, what was known jobs on the morning as my flight look at this right here

What is the endgame?

here's example. Earlier we already talked

about human animal hybrids, mass farming of humanoid tissue Transhuman in game

and we talked about aliens and you looked it up and it's all right

yeah. As for the aliens,

Creating a human animal remember is an alien like grays and stuff like that.

Grazer like like a robot yeah. I think it's I've heard that theory that it's not a real there's, no doubt in the same problem. The idea



is that a certain point time you can interface with that robot so that you could see it in real time through its eyes, even grave.

You really don't know what I'm saying. If, if

one day in richer biological androids hold on a second one day in the future. They

figure out a way to take a thing that looks like a human, avatar, yeah and

transported through a spaceship on to another planet, and you

look through its size because you're somehow another connected to the same with the content. That's still no, no you're all being prepared. Okay, yeah! Well, your bow hunting in your at all yeah. You saw the nineteen fifties diagram of the VR goggles we've got such a famous photo of a you. Don't

even any alien city, I don't believe they come,

come up there and pull up minder interdimensional. I think, from the same place where I think we're in this vast plain and there's a lot of shows employer. They got us in

closed in this little thing. Any



you will learn. Here's the thing you learn what the plan is by the attack. They don't want us having kids,

they wanted to moralized. They want to break this down,

they don't want to think we expand and they don't want us to believe

their space and I'm not trying to attack you, but they don't want

dimensional resource expansion. I don't even know that

what they don't want us third dimensional resources

yeah. What does that mean?

you know, if I want he's, not look. That's a nineteen fifties. Diagram no way saw that I'm glad he found the patent yeah. My dad told me yeah

virtual reality, and then I talked to this scientist

somebody else and then I found out other stuff.

Let's just say this, I'm not in the CIA me. Neither

I'm not the NSA me. Neither but they've been tracking me. My whole life.



Think they give you this information, sometimes you're. Absolutely for sure it was the CIA. It was the former deputy wrecker. Basically, the CIA section chief found founder of Delta force, who got

me to like two weeks ago, Alex you're not saying sandy hook stage, you go say: Sanders took stage because all we have the people were there and just because he was famous m. I t scientists and stuff. I went with that.

So you think already had computers, probably I'm speculating

King way out to set me. I mean I don't know, I'm sure this people setting everybody up if you think

I told you about this- I don't know, if told you about told people to listen to podcast, but this woman Renee to rest and she had a podcast with SAM Harris with they went into detail about the

operation that people would use to troll face

pages and Instagram pages and create these where the Russians

These troll bots and these meme pages for the hundredth



The Russians are all doing it. Everyone's doing everyone's doing the idea that just Russians are everyone's doing, but the thing that

fascinating was she was saying,

They organized a Muslim, a van across the street from a pro a van yeah want they want explosion. They would have black lives matter next to blue lives matter. They said everybody up with everybody. Blue lives matter is a lot of spam. Morrison

film school here in California trained on of the CIA. What was he trying to trade on? Can I can? I know that when I get less as said this before, and I've said

it's don't in the podcasts only keep to be. I'm not going to go to be again, but

windows, ten turn. Let me go first. Let me go first because me and Jamie all we got is the Cleveland. Browns will go off about Fucking Baker Mayfield for like ten minutes. Let me just say this job: they got that new guy from Kansas City and the only

play. They get. What I'm actually saying it



Infowars dot com and newswars horse dot com. You have to be. We had twenty six million subscribers between my three shows

on Itunes. All they were doing was looking at my feet. They delisted that and it killed us

and I was I was like, oh god, I hope I don't care about the lead off Youtube or Facebook dot. Don't figure out the I tunes. Don't don't do it wow that was like devastating.

Because people are like a isa, listen to, they don't need more, but I want to be

She clear you have to go to infowars dot com, you have to news to Newsworks

if you want to actually what I have to say in fact,

I'll tell you guys play I'm not mad a play, but

heard me say that Jimmy Chevelle would go, have sex.

With dead kids and also cut out their Sze. That has a drain a

and and eat it, and I know

sounds completely insane. He was a famous child molester. It's admitted

so Joe's like oh that's, crap, that's crazy! Alice is going schizophrenic. Well yeah.



I probably going crazy looking at all this and I should carry multiple dogs go crazy, but the adrenal

something saying Israel, so he go to exactly

This is a three minute video that I really think people should see it. Doesn't

anybody doesn't name names it?

do any of that stuff. But if you go

Infowars dot com was what's a Corina, a chrome man.

It's just you've heard about all these rich startup companies that like well, the parents.

The kid has are right away that ten year olds and blows blood

there are people taking kids blood right,

seems like teen. Blood is works well for people in there elderly years.

Is this true.

That's what I'm saying vampirism doesn't mean. Vampires are real. It means that attitude I don't know



I a three minute video on video on did reporters did a crow.

You said to me right

Can you tell him? The name is on your phone. You got it. Okay

This is only three minutes and I don't name it it's and I'm telling you this is real play. It will give here's the thing. Stop was stop stop right here. You too just released a bunch of total new guidelines. Were you planning?

the content you get a strike against you, you pulled for ninety days. You can't stream, you can't do shit yeah now there saying you can have comments that are bad, so now you're guilty for what your neighbor does. Well, not just making. Are you talking to you? Well, I don't know who the fuck is going to do it to who, but after this podcast I think that's gonna check this is our own content is totally fair. Use is not

Youtube is really a d monetizing, any videos that have truth and here's. What I liberty is that it's not everybody getting paid on Twitter. That doesn't mean we all advertise on. This is a radio shows, and our tv shows this big diversified media worldwide,



said: hey here's where you can get your material, it's a great system. So for ten years we built it up. So that the web was now

percent decentralized. Now it's ninety percent centralized and so once the big

that goddess us all centralized they

oh yeah, just like

castle's will take your bank account away. If you don't support us boom

all gone. So now we have

fight back against that there's something to that. You know

there's something to this idea that one John

corporation can decide,

based on their own personal ideology, what gets put on and what doesn't get put on, because Joe

control freaks everybody so glad you're in the fight. Now. Thank you is there

is there? What does that mean? Most Japanese

is a little bit. It's mark, it's totally legal. It just talks about Google searches for a drain across no, I

authorize you to hear my video okay, the only issue I just write the beginning. I see it has a part of a fair and low.



LAS Vegas odds of the dentist, the dentist okay, none of these jobs. Let's tell people the link, so they can

go to it themselves, show it, but this is. This is essentially about people they're putting old people is it people are putting,

young people's blood into old people's bodies. Is that what it is? It's that you were, and I know what your questions- you're, not a psychotic, Damon Damon person. Thank you.

And like I believe that Alex says some BBC broadcaster would go, have sex with dead kids bodies in the morgue Anita branch. That someone who said

I said I didn't believe bill. Maher was a pedophile. That's all I said

I said that his thing his, I don't think so. Your chair, buddy, I know, says he likes women, which is fine. I think you like swim.

You know what we're talking about him earlier and I could say this from the perspective of a stand up comedian. We say a lot of shit that we don't entirely mean because we think it's funny.

And I do it all the time. That's why Eddie

That's you earlier. You really think that someone's going to they're going



legislate to harvest babies he's doing that to

No, no there's any problem, that's his style of comedy but, like he said, he's been doing that style comedy since I met him like he loves to do that. He loves to pretend and fuck with you and then

you you is like a joking games, you're nursing that drink, let's go okay!

Can I have one of them whiskeys over there yeah we got do better Bravo's about to turn loose, not just a little

get your busy, but last time you too, shall we get states after this or yes do it? Do it.

You want Xevion it. Could you

Imagine if we announced we're going to say that's a joke. I understand

hey but Joe. Let me get temperature all the time and everything everything appreciate.

This is really something really really glad. We did this shopping right, no, no! Stop

I want to say this would be clear. Um



I have literally been trying to find out. What's going on

and as you get older, you figure out more stuff,

not the one saying, there's all these aliens, the entire!

government government, all of these advanced groups that

they've, given up on space, is all

interdimensional! So I didn't finish up about. I want to get any tech, then I'll get into your tank. Okay is that I've got pretty good

standing by interviewing a bunch of people involved about what the master plan

is an exactly who we're dealing with, because it's not just

aliens what what's the different groups and what are you basing this on

what, when you say it you're saying like really like you're, really sure what do you base this on?

about general stubblebine right now? Don't

He was a major general general,

who is the head of all class clandestine operations for US government for like fifteen years,



and he said on my shell before he died at like ninety, eight or whatever, but also in private discussions, and this is

like six seven years ago now was everything like fifteen years ago.

Is the guy that ran the whole show.

You know: men. It goes yes, that's a joke about that. It kind of white washes it all, but they broke through.

Contact and they had volunteers, really serious people who who were taking huge doses of drugs. Do this?

Then our NASA was doing it and that's what I got to the point of

Well. Why should we try to go to other places? The third dimension is just as empty wasteland above it and below. It is all this incredibly complex stuff, but our brains tune all of it out, but we can't handle it.

Okay, that's why I like young people before they hit puberty are known to be psychic, because wherever we

they're able to see through the veil and all religions are based about seeing of the veil. Well, that's what intense meditation does for you right, whole tropic, breathing, a lot of that kundalini stuff



you're doing is allowing your brain to relax its boundaries and interface with all the other dimensions that are around us all the time exactly, but you usually can only get through psychedelic drugs, but dark forces dark form. Generally

Are the ones that are willing?

forces, are not willing to get involved in free will. So you think that they are ach

full entities that are in these dimensions that you're in contact. Okay, there are have

Possibly this personally like it's at a minute there are

There are hundreds.

And their discovery new ones all the time of parasites back

create worms that control life forms. They want

you ever the zombie ants or

zombie wasp, which will watch what the boss yeah

yeah, there's so many of them they keep finding ways,

particularly the insect world, which is really interesting. So the low

level



able to infect you with something that controls your brain down to exact activities. Yeah exact activities have you purse.

He had any experience with interdimensional beings. Well,

because it's all taboo and people. Let me tell you, I have

I have one hundred percent communicated with something. The question is

that something was actually in my imagination or in my mind, or that

something was something that takes place in another dimension. I don't know, I can't be sure

there's no way to put it on a scale there's no way they threw it running through a test. But what I do know is that it's the same experience I can okay sure

Eric Muller, who you know, Mechell Muller Beak,

as he's the one guy willing to. Let me tell a story. I've literally talk to. I see a hundred people from it's. It's probably more than that, because I'm not about this for a long time. He,



Christian, but he heard about all this, so he went down to a couple places in Central South America. Did it twice both times was thirty to forty people in the group and he's like well Alex

I just don't believe in demons, but I did see basically aliens come to the edge of the forest and we were all seeing it come on we're all saying the same thing, but I think it was a chemical reaction. You don't have a key if you

everybody gets drunk. We all think about what happened was in high school or college, or what's good and what's bad, we all have different experiences

when you're taking a hallucinogen

and suddenly you're all seeing the same thing. It just means it clicked off. The part of your brain is a film,

search, go crazy, yeah, there's a lot of

will just see more and then they see every

it doesn't mean they're right. It just means that the filter is off,

who said, give her run your hand over an insect that can't see they have no idea you're there. They, like certain in

fix it, just don't see anything whether it's a centipede or whatever, and how? How do we know what they see, what we don't



you're right. We we by dissecting dead ones. We have an understanding what sensors they possess and we can. We think of the a b e or a fly sees like in a bunch of little like after I told the guy on the right track alone. We know that they have a lot of different yeah. We don't know what the exact spirits was. I I told the holes stores yeah got computer sucked up the damn bugs that got everything,

love bugs the differences. Let me tell ya: yeah they've got rope

five years ago. They had

control trash with microchips they send.

Five hundred yards to bombed out building with a camera on their top? They had thirty years into dolphins too. Right in this trap. They've got approach is often said: Mainline scientific, american roaches with a chip on their head that run around the diff,

This is. The reason is dangerous.

Is that once you open that gate, it's all bad? They has it all bad. Why? Why can't you experience that

dimensional being

and learn something from it and be a better person,



because for whatever reason at first, it's all

beautiful and so you're an aztec base cat napping, all the

tribes and killing, who

the tallest of the smartest every time

gets control. It

but murdering everybody and always

it's beautiful. It always starts great, so you're talking about ancient civilizations, with a ritualized psychedelic drugs and they wind up killing everybody like every dish in every cash. The priest say we have to pro. Babies are the fires. We have to cut their hearts out. We have to

fight in general, true or false. Supposedly, the mushrooms were used by the Aztecs so that they wouldn't resist.

That get 'em all high on mushrooms. It was beyond that. We had cut their hair in a cocktail, they don't.

Dozens of elusiveness and toxins that would give him an enema, true or false though they did

used mushrooms just to keep him sedated,

makes it makes sense if you get they killed, pull this up. I think the Temple



I forget how you said it t o con teal con, but in this one temple I

think they killed some insane amount of people after it was constructed after the kids, Russia, tens of thousands,

They sacrificed tens of thousands of people that the ones that were actually working to build the Temple

blue tailed everybody I've been down. There was like in real real university heads who I want hear

These are the Mayans and they said yeah,

no we're open higher, dimensional gate. The gods want blood and they didn't take it internally. The mouth they would take in Imus of dozens of hallucinations and alcohol

and so the priest would take a couple of drugs and then the priest,

communicate with the aliens.

And the aliens wanted blood, and they also said it was more like we're shopping hearts out. Yes, sir, ok, we did one thousand, ok, the gates, open it open here it goes Jamie says it says they between wow between

ten thousand and forty 48th



in four hundred persons were sacrificed in the ceremony and one thousand four hundred and eighty seven. When the Aztecs completed the temp,

and how do you say the Temple name pull up the top of the? How do you say it's?

it's all over. How do you say the Temple name?

And so that's Mexico, city TOA con.

I think I'm Mexico cities, where they think they killed about five billion people first

This is one day fucking insane

and they killed eighty thousand people in a couple of days. But now-

and this come out the way you go down there and you're

walking around in the woods and the mind- God goes the bones and they pick up and you're like it's, not gravel. It's petrified. Bones are everywhere moments on the. Let me go further. The priesthood were meat sellers. This happened in Europe as well, they would hang the people up and the the stores the mark



is below the temples, and so you would eat the meat and the most valuable meat was warriors

when you won the ball, throwing game that alone for days. They would kill you that killed you, the ones

who won were murdered. This is the thing they used to

think they sacrificed a losing team. Now they

there's a sacrifice. The winning team had a bit about for a while, while

must be a long, ass, fucking game ever is just check. Dropping the ball fucking up now, but they were all fighting because they wanted. They believe they were forced from their side yeah. They told him. They said Quikscat lip

the flying serpent Cuatto could sit quietly

is going to you're going to interface, it upload its brain and you

paintings it's all like spaceships and dials, and they have perfect in the span.

Jan Fraternity years premised on a hoax users. There's there's drawings of it to all your old spanish text books. You know she at eight eight, eight, it's about like a half foot long. It



It looks like a jumbo jet with the windows and the engines. Sure

in the mind, smoke penis blood. They

it will take. What they did was that I made that shit. I appreciate it. I thought he was just being silly. No, no that's true. They took, they took long lines of leather shag, war, leather,.

And had it had it had nails on it and it and or had like a spiky things, a glass and they would put

in their genitals, oh the most skilled, is freeze. The high priest were sacrificing people for our,

you're saying hallucinogens, would like not

try to cut his testicles off, but only the most

skilled, which sit there and draw them through they. Wood smoke, the blood so that they can see the lower. Previously, the lower priest with input

talk to there and said they would put it on sacred leaves and then they would smoke the general blood yet of the high priest



They would talk to the right. I believe it's just people are so goofy. Look if you see those african, ladies with the giant plates in their lips, have you

so the the next the next yeah, how about that? They stretch their necks out to the point where, if they take those things off their head will fall off people.

Going to do all kinds of crazy things. Their body, I'm not surprised they smoke, shows blood

The Bible says the old testament new testament, which is pretty powerful. I know people misinterpret, but it

each to text. People there like you

Ezekiel like three burning

gulls land, there's a

Lou firm and over its head. It gives me something to take. I take it, I'm giving the full data of the plan that that that the

genetics has been infested and God must destroy everyone in this an alien story. Oh, it's one hundred percent, but that's what they always talk about. There was talk about that being an alien story. That's what one of the primary stories when they talk about the Bible, Ezekiel's vision, vision,

wheel within a wheel that



There was how do you rate it yeah? It says floating off the ground in the Hebrew yeah and it seems as pretty clear to floating comes a thing with a crystal ferment over its head noon, and then the face is shifting different creatures. It's like a

screen. Well, if you think about how long it would take for an alien to get here it really

he makes sense that unless they have a constant basis in a robot they visit or if they, if they came by themselves, they came by themselves a long fucking time ago. Look if they were able to make interstellar travel like to

three thousand years ago, which is not that big of a leap, if you think about us

three thousand years from now, would probably can do something like that right. So if they were doing,

that three thousand years ago and they found human beings, and these are the stories that we have these stories like

you'll and like there's a bunch of different.

Two stories about contact with the skies. You know the

the to tabulation yeah, there's a world government, the beaches, fifty feet tall, it shifts,



see at the same time, it's a hologram and you've got these

digital systems- if you don't go along with, you can't buy herself yeah people say: oh, that's, not real, but it's manifesting and then go two thousand years in the future. They have advanced technology. Don't send people anymore now this in aliens. If you go back to the old days, it was

actually some sort of humanoid or a large thing, like all the Zachariah,

the citizenship. Exactly that's what makes

that's what all those guys were telling you like, Avatar James Cameras, definite dialed in it's like no we're there jack we're jacking in well. It makes sense that if

was a visitor to this planet five, ten fifteen thousand years ago, if there was maybe more

Maybe there was a visitor one hundred

thousands of years ago that actually did genetic experiments on lower hominids. If that was really the case, it makes sense that their technology would have increased

more rapid. But let's go past that

obviously scientist like the plant, things garters like to plan things, and but that's



that's exactly what the globalist believe is that

they're just aware of what the fucks going on there is powerless, as we are,

the real argument more and more they only.

But solos people in charge who are compartment

is nobody else knows who will carry this out.

We're able- because we're advanced look at this, because, let's just get down to brass tacks: tax tax love tax, Joe! You just said it

Instead of some weird dumb preacher, you know and

In Alabama on fashion, Alabama, saying stuff you get mad at this, don't look at

so demonized look at. Why is demonized think about that right?

about how it says.

There there's no reality- and God creates a whole new virtual reality gives light, does all of it.

And then his genetic experiment by rogue elements gets involved. It's all right there when you actually look at

and you expand on it and you're like

My god, this like beyond the science fiction book, and so it's



obvious thing, that's why they keep telling us. Oh look. Piltdown man was fixed up no Joe,

they didn't accelerated, accelerated, mutagenic they're doing to us now something new.

They didn't accelerate immunogen immunogenic program on this planet.

Humanity. What what the Bible start with

we are made in the image of God.

Does that mean we don't have God's knowledge, but I've got advancement where the

image? Well? What is an image? It's a scan, its numbers, it's the genetics, it's the potential, so

we are the aliens Joe and everybody already knows this. We are the

Do you think that we are a product of alien intervention? They took these lower hominids and accelerate their evolution by applying their genetics? Do you know we

here's the deal they say we're ninety seven percent chimpanzee, but then they actually get

the deeper genetics were closer to pigs or rats. Show. I think that this was an environment built for us.



Were the master genetic program and they're all subsets of us just for a back story and that's what the globalist thing

yeah. But do you think that the aliens created us like this is like one of the primary here's, what the elite beliefs.

The elves are biological androids. The grace

there's other systems going on and no one knows his old warfare, psychological,

If no one knows the truth, is it's it's virtual reality. Once you get to that

so. No one knows we just don't work,

but we are- and I'm just here I rifle powerful, the Globe

STAR S. The elites are obsessed because, reportedly obviously humans was pretty freaking cool. We've got

some big giant mission and maybe that's a program- I don't know

we're like pretty super advanced, but you can't put something out like the spartan

when their kids were seven they from up for two years in the woods you can't just

put something out like like, like, like liberals, you give everybody very everything, their little assholes. So this is like boot,



camp and training and

the testes and do all this, and basically

this planet is what the people say. It's a big test

in ground for uh,

things that are going to come and we are at

our God and I don't mean I'm gone,

but I'm already God I've achieved godhood 'cause. You can see that

national yourself and the lower level. Elves will tell you that, because they

we know you're bad ass, but if they can trick a tad,

whole, it's gonna grow into Godzilla to go, kill it

If their winning so you so so the else are attached. The elves are a test on us to attack.

And see the survival of fittest, but there nothing there like by the

can we achieve look back, go we're going to look at that because I think, when you

jump to the next level an even bigger war going on. What's the biggest war,

consciousness in the universe is an interdimensional spacecraft. Beyond that. That looks like a comment from my research and it



it has its head as it's corona, but the consciousness conscious

it carries evil in the tail end of consciousness, has a location

giant consciousness. Is God okay

swimming in a giant system of survival of fittest that God is created to test God. Self okay looks like a comment, so you got gods conscious and all the good things that

going forward, but God knows that everybody has to be tested so that

will goes out and at the end of the

well is basically evil. That's why Christ

get behind me Satan and it's always

trying to test God and infiltrate up into it to sabotage damn they do pull the plug in this podcast is a good way to end this

mother fucker? Have your burnout want to know? I'm not I'm just saying it, one thousand three hundred and something if the fucking governments come in

but shall they love you? Could you return on you, but you guys been talking about aliens so much dude, trust



This is going to be one of the biggest Youtube videos of all this at the move to talk about aliens as much as possible in love aliens, they loved it all over children's program want bs alien stuff over. They come out of space. It's interdimensional Eddie! Well, when you say aliens, it sounds like you're talking to the elite, the playdium, that's what it sounds like delete, literally believe there in contact with these things,

They are

I want use on DMT and you tell us you have these:

experiences where the thoughts become patterns they become like geometric patterns that are moving through space.

They change and shift, but they're letting you know that they know all.

Bullshit, they see right through

you thought is creation to want you to relax. Yes, there is a lot of that. There's. A lot of thought is creation yeah, but but the only,

lax to see. Don't struggle call them aliens, though what I saw

I've never referred to him as a, but that's the term. Everyone knows not of this world, not of our average thing. I would listen



I would think it was aliens, it woke me up in the middle of the night and took me aboard a ship and that's what I experienced. I would be one hundred percent convinced that I went to a

alien spaceship, and I talked to these things. The difference is how it was like

to smoke it and then lay back and an experience. That is like. I expected that progression of of events, but if

woke up in the middle of the night. I was going to take a leak and a light

shone down to the bathroom and they suck me through the window took me aboard a spaceship and I saw

exact same thing that I saw

high on DMT, be one hundred percent

events that I was in contact with aliens. The different. The only difference is how I got there like. I got there through a drug

got there through smoking, something that's produced by the human brain that I knew was pretty

safe. No one's ever died of it. I'm like, let's see what happens when I go back to everyone, I'm out to

in mash groups taking particularly I'll Oscar. They have group

fans and see the same thing to hear the same thing. Yes yeah, which is the site you can actually, but it's beyond that, you could argue all



one person's a psychic leader. They projected everybody else, mind yeah, but who's, projecting that into them

So that's the only way it's out this. This is what

Pentagon. It might not be someone projecting anything into your mind. It might be your newfound ability to perceive things that you could the way I look at,

like no, I agree, but why are they all forty three people

you know in Costa Rica all seeing aliens? This is a bad example is a bad example, but it's not a bad one. If you fart

and you didn't, have a nose. No one would know if we didn't have

sense of smell. We

the smell, we could still get along in the slide. I agree there was a way to visually see if food is one individual, Alusa nation there's all saying it, but

what I'm saying is it's entirely possible that there's a multiple?

tensions are multiple things that we can't perceive.

We haven't. We don't have the senses for

they're around us all? No, I agree. That's a little unusual briefly, the job in our attic. Let me tell you what my deep research and basically vision as



okay, you just major, like things crystallize a penny to to talk about twelve divisions of La Levin, known twelve being on the present, so we all set actually says.

To say that is Eragon, so I won't say that, but I have

dreams. My whole life that come true.

And the weirdest thing, like a lady drops a thing of pickles at the store for five years. I have the dream that one day I'm there and it's the woman in the pic

break or or a lamb in no time was this. When I was a kid, it was more intense eyes, fucking crazy. So,

for five years you have the same dream and one day it happened, was it exact

have you dreamt ish fuck for about six

once I had a dream of a guy in a purple and green striped shirt, and I'm like. Why am I want, because it's not like normal range is like your been taken over



was get vomited lucid, like a lucid dream, is a dream and I'm walking around while behind a building and all of a sudden there's some dude in a purple and green striped shirt, he attacks me and six months later it happens. I mean it happens exactly so. What do you think is going on? If you mean all thoughts of yourself aside, just

just look at it objectively. What do you think that is? You could say that it's human programming and basic programming in the brain? Do you think you're tapping

to a timeline that maybe you can access all the time? That's another reason I wanted to get a grant one

the reason why you can rant and rave and when you spew out information the way you do, which is it very impressive? The way you can talk

about thirty three hours straight, get excited about things. You do the majority of your programs entirely by yourself, no telling what he was talking. I was this

doing something unusual? I'm not even doing it. It's like a river going by there's a turtle



the fish, there's a the log. That's why it's like random, like

is this. What is that exactly right? But that's how you communicate that's like in the beginning of the thing we were talking about sandy hook, I kept trying to slow you down. I was like I'm, not

calling you down this river, you just hit this one rock. I want to talk about this rock. I want to talk about the next rock, but you just keep going the way you think about things.

Is your your chaining one thing to the next thing to the next thing, to the next thing and for people who are not

thinking the way you're thinking it could be exhausting. Are you

right about it all?

I'm only seeing that like the code, but I'm wondering because of the fact you're telling me that you had these dreams that came true exactly the way you dreamt them. I know you're not full of shit.

Not a liar. I've known you for a long time. If that really did happen to you, if

This is your real life experience. I want to know what the fuck that is, you are, you. Are you on the periphery

you have your finger on a membrane that maybe other people can't totally touch where occasionally just to



Usually you get a little peek through and you get to see

side, even it's only once or twice in your life, who is

Say that what you're experiencing by being able to see these things that manifest themselves realistic,

in the future, that this isn't what human beings will have?

five years from now or a hundred years from now

sure exactly we think of like a cell phone be magic art are, we think, we're all the same? That's the thing. We think we're all the same, we're not all the same

we're, not all the same in our ability to talk, you can talk for a law

longer days, and I do any bravo- could talk about jujitsu better than both

us he's a musician you you and I both suck at music right. So there's there's certain things that

people can do that. You can't, let me try to describe it

and they'll use it against people notice, don't touch it because it's their whole religion. They can't stand. I'm talking about it by the time

like three years old. I would have this dream that God has, because God knows,



everything is a super intelligent, omnipresent, unlimited dimensions, but God doesn't know where God came from. So just like we're trying to find out where we came from

God is like a virtual reality simulation as well, and God is constantly running

every program every operate

which in turn, evil lose good, lose everything show

I would have these dreams, but the earliest memories like three

where I would fly out to the edge of infinity and it was? It was continual message find

where we came from find out what it is, and it would just be this big giant, spinning black vortex, like a black hole and then I would have to go into that trying to figure out what was going

on and ever it was the same thing and sources. It

frustration

show then growing up and dealing with things in questioning politics and questioning all these other areas that

dreams that come true exactly and



knowing what's going to happen before it happens, and then questioning it and then.

Being wrong like weird, like brightly crazy stuff man like like just so much stuff,

becomes like you can't even deal with you like dial it out, and then you just reach that point. Where.

You don't even know what's real anymore, because it's so crazy, but then you see like the mathematics of the whole system and you know how it works. It's not like you're, some schizophrenic, you talk about it, you deal with it and actually works like now. When you fi

the system, you automatically know what to do. When you talk

something. The president word for word repeats me. Trump is what freaks x out

for word. A whole speech is like

things and I'm on a power trip. That's what they flipped out about the CIA and everywhere else.

And they're like well Jones, just like connected a trumpet, I think, from like an idiot savant. What does that have to do with the speech? Explain that Trump's speech,



I'm I'm trying to follow. I don't even know I don't even have the thing it's hard to follow. You sometimes

You're talking trains trumps. So for that I believe, was even before that he was talking about God. Yet so God, God does everything except where God came from. That's a good sound bite right there. Do you think the God

is just like every other system that we see like think of this there's. No

one not is the motion of it is no one bird there's, no one bird, that's running all the birds, there's! No one person, that's running all the people,

it's all chaos, even if we elect someone, if they have the fucking people hate him, everybody's

in chaos is Conder trying concept, our struggle. Are you? So do you think that God is still centralized? Do you think of the idea of

God is decentralized that maybe God is a real thing, but is not one person

that is literally organisms. God is not



Free will got its consciousness. It's all the organisms, it's every technological innovation. I think God is with all of the things longer, and I knew anything new age is a counterfeit jobs. I was really out of it. Announcing a carver was real

because they'll say, oh God is everything that is was true.

Is experiencing consciousness or all of us. There's there's no MIKE wherever hard time saying that I know this, I could say, God might be decentralized. I could say God

I just be just like every other organism on the planet. It's just something

it's moving in a certain direction, trying to protect itself and trying to procreate and trying to advance and trying to innovate and trying to be better than it was yesterday. That's everything is doing every fuck

animal that started out as a single celled organism is trying to survive, because I setting create themselves well, it's not necessarily that it didn't create itself with something created it slowly. But surely let's say that through the process of evolution mutation, this is the only people over hours. We should do an epic podcast, but the point is



we should not give up. Let's talk about the point is

there is a pro human future? Anna, a pro free will future and the globalist or at

or at Anti human Anti free will future.

All I know is to swim towards the light. This is

for pro human future. This is the point, and this is one of the reasons why I wanted to discuss this with you, and this is one of the things that I talked about with TIM Pool recently and one of the things that when we have a revised pod,

which is coming up very soon with Jack from Twitter,

we all need to talk about open communication, that this is it's very bad for all people involved.

But people down from communicating as long as are now

doing anything to actively try to harm Kennedy said those that make people peaceful acts

or whatever he said, people that make peaceful action, illegal

violence and have a lot of yeah. That's a that's a pretty my. To paraphrase it, but that's a perfect quote: people don't like being left on the outside and that's what I came.



One of things about you and I having this conversation we had our blow up, is coming

understand that you felt like you were left on the outside and me as a person who is constantly busy and wasn't paying attention that it was self

of me to not pay attention to how you must have felt to be stuck on the outside. Well, I just felt regardless of what you did, what would we we, you wish you didn't, do or didn't do what I like about,

which is what we saw today. I mean one

the best things about this podcast to be. I got to show people what I really

love about Alex Jones, your fucking fun. This is hilarious and you say a lot of shit that turns out to be real and turns out to be of real, can

turn and you make some really good points about all the shit that has a job. I don't want to be right about them. Killing babies doesn't mourn. I know you don't want to. You want to be right about human. You don't have to be you don't be

It doesn't matter whether you you want it right. Jesus



well podcast we're going now. Don't do that. That was like six hours or something your honor. I think Kevin Smith was long. This is like five and a half fucked

he's a great guy just kidding. I love them. Okay, thirty Tonto, fine man with flowers. Look, here's a fine! Listen I'll, be honest with you! Huh! I'm kind of retarded

no. No, no that's going be a sound bite. They're going to put that to mariachi music. No, I might have to use your you,

blue flame thrower delight the next choice. I'll take a public tobacco, but no seriously when it comes to regular line, regular tobacco with no marijuana at all. Would you like some.

Dublin, I know know need for our guts, never wrong.



Look up the show little gonna give it all your points. What points? That's all I got points hundred percent one hundred percent. Thank God. No points got some great points. No, no

any any big. We are the ambassador of the flight

society, no, not

bladder cancer, Samedi, barely listen any but doesn't believe more than he believes. Listen. So if somebody putting it down everybody filter, it became a universal truth. He would fuck and start believing the earth is round. No,

no size. Contrary is the flat earth. Society is controlled opposition. Nobody, that's in flatter, okay! Listen!

I know there's a lot of bullshit, so I rather society was real. I respect you

I do I love you. The point is: is that I'm asking you a real question here? Okay to be the biggest doctor,

in history. It only cost like a million dollars. Okay, let's it a fifty thousand time big ship and to have it circumnavigate the planet and



who will be there with GPS? No, no! No! I'm not going to be there. No we're going to get someone to represent me there. Okay,

We could draw it out now will get weird lawyer launch, I'm not doing no, no, no, we're launching the discovery of flat earth project. Well that rocket

and do dirty shooting himself in the space

really easy! You know! You know you prove the earth with that. We really live on a ball. How, when you get when they supposedly make those missions to the ISS when they shoot up just have that one of the astronauts it's

go to the the just: have a go pro camera

on his helmet and just go uncut no cuts, no cuts.

The time you get on that ship to the time you

talk and I want you to doctor at nine

but for now no frigate technology, Cousteau never said anything. My cell phone, my cell phone, is awesome. Let's listen this IP combative here, but



Now we're gonna be in competitive. This then we talk, I know, but you talking over each other. If that did happen, would you want some tobacco?

Papa John's. Do it sure if that happened, while secure man in the first time, I'm saying this had been said. If that, if that happened, you let it go yeah, they don't there's no footage of the construction of the international space station. There's no footage. It just appears: there's not a spender space, no footage of the commercial modules of the international. Are you sure about that? One hundred percent there's no footage in the construction. People that worked on the space station have known astronauts there real

people man, they were there. They are real people, I didn't say so you don't think it's really constructed or you would like to see the footage. First, the footage. Listen, listen! If you know

there's a debate? Let me finish to let me just there's a debate out there

do you believe we went to the moon or not you ha.

Everyone needs to acknowledge that there is a debate. There's people that

one like a laser hold on hold on there's people that believe



we went to the moon and there's people believe that we faked it, you have to understand,

three people are exactly exactly so. When you talk about the people that

won't believe we went to the moon when

they also say they're, taking uh

other space ship to you.

I kind understand where they're coming from.

That believe, whether they win or not. Maybe we were maybe

I don't know, but there's people that don't believe it's so when

Don't you should understand it? They have

no trust for any of that. I love love. How many times you got gotta fake going to the moon before you go okay before that bullshit meter,

fucking explodes no. I agree. Let's finish it all. Ok, guess rubber got mad about sandy hook, which I think happened have a right to question one. I was watching minion

three or four where they go to us and they run through.

The minions engine run through Hollywood

changing the moon landing people have a right to do that.



There's. Nobody wants to send people up as a bunch of die, a bunch of test pilots time we fly on

jumbo jets around the country are cell phones work? Do you think we definitely went to the moon,

absolutely one hundred percent. Absolutely bet your life on it, but the difference is: is that

they say I say didn't happen.

The truth is that we have time on our shows and eyes. Moon landing. I've denied a bunch of

you know they say Alex Jones says

there are you,

Human slaves on Mars ever set it. But

All I'm saying is: I know the real NASA people and.

Warner VON Braun, the guy who directed all six moon missions, was a nazi correct

He hung out with Walt.

Correct, yeah, yeah

in the fifties just made up space. They never know when, whenever I went to space

the space, what welfare raining had spacey, why was on the phone you for forty five minutes? This morning I told you have a twelve inch telescope



twelve inch diameter opening aperture. Yes, we talk to look at the Freaking moon. Taken thirty five millimeter photos there. It's there

shit, you see when you look up it's there.

You get a telescope. You can see that we're not gonna have a space is fake conversation. You told me the fucking, like you can't do this. I didn't say the lights. What are they? I? Don't know well, I don't know what they are

The way I described this is the same way. I talk about jujitsu you. You should never

talk about how effective martial arts are just sort of just saying that you can prove that shit. You can prove all those things about three million miles away. There's no proof that you got to believe that we even real people that have souls and free will. As you can see,

maybe we don't even exist. You don't exist, Joe doesn't exist and nobody exist.

So because we can't have a space is spaces fake talk, my head will break break. Let's not do it. My point of all the



because I don't want to have it space discussion either. But my point is that if there's people out,

there, that believe we faked

went to the moon six times you have to

understand their skepticism, that yes, this is hold on. You know what it means we actually talked about before when he was talking about that. That's all! This is what we talked about before when he was talking about the reason why he questions anything because he's seen so many different things. It turned out to be basically so exactly the same in earlier, and he was actually saying that sometimes you can get fucking crazy with it. You think that everything is fake and you call bowl

on things that really aren't but human exploration. Israel, yes,

we do some stuff stuff like what we've done

wars and shit like what like electricity, that's awesome, Tesla, right, yeah

worst test lab. Now, I'm not just how 'bout all the technology that you enjoyed and make your life harder. I love it



I'm sorry, that's of course. Of course, I'm talking to the same science allows people to understand the distance between earth and Mars same stuff. Then you get into your over by the way. I'm not trying to make points. This after you've taught me a lot you're, really smart guy, an entrepreneur.

Task show

I think it's healthy to be where you're at questioning everything.

Buying everything all I'm telling you is is this.

Yes, we have now one hundred years ago, would be considered magic.

And we humans can go away. Yes, I agree with that. Fucking

I found a dude. I know people that I went over to the day it's hospital and it does nothing

What does NASA scientist on the main line in the videos running NASA? I might worry there.

Yes, I ran the RCA cameras. We fake the photo

because the radiation belt hit. They they'd Ultima,

but we should have done that. I freaking know what happened. That makes way more sense to me,

one of the things that Jamie and I have actually discussed when we talked about the gemini fifteen photo the famous photo of Michael Collins. That turns out.



Be just a reverse of a photo of him on a training mission, or is it a hard yeah? They wanted PR the music I did go to to. I went to three what ads of NASA engineers one of his room and take that, let me talk a

Raymond was there running this freaking here and the lasers on the moon

He ran the deals. He said what was weird is that another

group of ships,

You know what I that I just couldn't. Do it another group of ships

yet, but basically he wouldn't, but basically he this is not.

I was going to meet with him. I met with him at the former Norac

Jambase. The Hilton outside Austin,

wouldn't tell me in like a week later, his heart blow. He

ready to tell me he said no Israel, but there's more advanced and

the letters is how she looked at him. He's like the main guy like running the cameras.



Number three in NASA like for engineers. Frequent was in Vietnam ran black ops in Cambodia and he said

he said. Well, we lost a lot of people with those were clandestine operations. I wasn't part of it so compartmentalized. He said you're right that there were a bunch of missions before

man 'cause. The US is willing to killed fifty people to do that, just to see if they can get

so no one else will be the most tragic thing that people take us. Is that great Joe know? We were willing to

men already to die over and over again for the one time at work and that's what,

This is all well Gus Grissom in those original blew up on them. Left we blew up on the launchpad, you know will be in

credibly tragic. If is it is if they actually did go to the moon, but they fake the footage.

Is the radiation, so there really

is bullshit ever believes you know, but you know how how horrific that would be if you were a guy,

like Neil Armstrong and you knew that the footage is bullshit, but you actually had gone to the moon. You like fuck



This whole thing was like people are starting to why these, where is it? Look like their own wires? There's absolutely there on trampolines like by the way they all got radiated 'cause. It's true like he says going through that,

one thousand Chester X rays or something you know even for his noon, you know is like ten text Chester,

yeah. You know what those, although I thought it was only one notice. How do you know what's more notice how the international flights are all now at night? Why's that, because there's freaking already do

so you go to sleep, it's a red eye. No, no! No solar radiation from thirty five

feet to to to sea level on average

Is ten feet of water about six?

is a stone there's dirt. Quite, why is the sun so big on the

on the minutes. Explain that again, what are saying imagine

the atmosphere is a lance. Okay, so

why do you think the son of the moon looks so much?

horizon. Why is that

I always thought it was just



Harrison go alone, or is it somewhere that red? Why is it red the atmos

here, you're, looking so more up there

you're, looking through one thousand miles a set of twenty miles, show them

moon gets smaller interns totally? Why does it goes up right?

so this is this is like astronomy, saying because you're looking at on the plane- and I forget- we

talking about that flights, yeah

radiation radiation

whatever it is. You get a bunch of chest x, rays right when you fly during the day, because the sun solar radiation, because you're above

Everybody, a body knows you're in the mountains, you get a worse sunburn, wise in less oxygen, less dropping the uv

show when you're at thirty five thousand feet. That's above this himalayan yeah you, you are up there and there's no there's, there's average average thirty five thousand feet. This is NASA



probably true hand feet of water

inches of stone, thirty, five thousand feet of dust. The filter

oh wow, wow. When you hit a filter on your Iphone. Does it turn another color put a filter over right, so think about think about the atmosphere

you're. Looking straight up the bones: fucking white.

Look at this angle: it's yellow right! It's big and

orange on Damn, that's big. It's not just words coming up! That's part of it! It's that it's it's bubbled

to form, looking through a pair of glasses on the edge so you're looking.

For all that atmosphere. You looking through pollution. You look through dirt everything yeah yeah. My dad told me all that that's fucking amazing, no

So that's why moons are red?



they're red, with a rise in their white with a top? That's all the shit, we're looking at it through what yeah we've got a weird situation: huh, a big ass one, slash four sized planet, just floating

just floating above us, we stare at it. Well, it's a full moon tonight that is fucking, weird, there's a planet there right there. I felt like it looks o'clock last night:

miss your call, and I will up like three thirty and I had to get up and I looked out it looked fake news so sometimes times half moon and I was looking out the hotel like a fabric, Gardner

and I'm looking at how beautiful that is. Just like hey, it's okay to say it's made.

This probably is: did you ever see that movie dark city level way fucking movie, Kiefer Sutherland Fucking Great movie? Sometimes

good movie is like a twilight zone. That's a like a twilight zone, it's a classic! I watch that of the again, but it makes me feel some.

Times like reality like like,



That movie was so strange because it was like this weird scripted, real

only these people out they have no you're fine. I am way through the surface, should all lose your family's real? Yes, your

consciousness, Israel! No! No! No! I'm not! I know you know, I don't know, I agree, it's almost saying it's fast. No, no, I great times I'm sure you're moving, I'm saying right. Yeah is virtual. Yes, but you're real. Yes, your real too you've been put it. All of us were put into a simulation to basically testis and that's the big thing I'm trying to get across to people Damn Alex Jones

Let's wrap this mother fucker up this question. Okay, go help.

Copter in its South Africa or wherever I can you imagine, the film seek

searching flat earth doing.



I'm sending a representative. We should know you should be on a shot, go on Santa's representative. Do you have a I'll have like a contest? You really praise him. That's a good move, have a contest.

And then we'll just have a camera man on the whole town, lava cameramen you paid for the cameraman's flight.

Hundreds no coverage of the satellite was Amy could fill sixty four b did not also GPS, so there's this whole

GPS and you can like leave la on a ship

and you go all the way over to Japan and share body and go down

around Indian around Africa Needle and knew you could do it if it's all a flat plane. That's like you're, just not thinking right

You could do go anywhere. You want, if it's flat

anywhere you what people think like you rounded edges certain windows open. So we can the top. Also, as you told me this morning, it was good office. You told me this morning not this morning. Yesterday, no one is more on



You said you said you said basically was no way to prove any of this approve any of what what is all this? What's this we're waiting

space you're saying is you're generalizing.

Matthew questioning, I think it's great, I'm not gonna go to jail or be sued for watching. You said you just said that I said something and I don't even know what you think this whole song. I got Alzheimer's, not here. What do you think this all this shit with like people thinking the earth is flat or people thinking spaces fake? What do you think that's coming from I'll tell you it might be able to get anything.

Oh my god, this year, you've got a spectrum, so you got people that don't even know their human or of life exist. Is this all the sedation, because they've been lied through so much for soul?

Well then, it was true and then

we're here you've got people that just believe whatever they see on CNN and



yeah I'm just trying to look at everything going well. They've lied a lot, but sometimes it's not that long times is incompetence. What's real, and so I don't

that's like way over here or other people.

Like way over here, 'cause they're, trying to

some solace order of the universe, the truth

there's not order in the universe

well trying to bring order. The universe and that's why they staged events, so they can try

to bring order? Within that event,

What event are you talking about? No nor

the woods or gulf of Tonkin or whatever the thing is, or or taking a relevant making a big, but it's not bad to question that

So how do we get convinced to say? Well, you know I ask questions and I

give me shut down as long as I'm legitimately asking questions. There's no judge that I have that right. So that's where we're all going just

what is the system will get rid of free speech right to self defense? The family

in those things and ask you:



what are we about working man? I believe in that you that say that say that again, was it right to bear arms free speech was a third one, family family.

What were the biggest amazing

John? You question. It was a big three say that again,

You know, I think mystery is, I think

what is going on now you get why

get me guys. I don't want to be like my life is not sandy hook up said there tell me what

tell me earlier that you were actually even before all this happened. You were planning your exit strategy. Like you get weary of this,

yeah. It's not like I'm afraid of fight, but I'm forty five.

A long adventurous life, so I'm probably like sixty and

I was already like, I wasn't sure about Trump or whatever has really



he got elected nothing. He was bad, just like all the war's start

and then I was already playing kind of face things out, just because I don't like down on fifty five, a heart attack and the fact they attacked me. So much makes me after battle and fight and never give up and and and so

It's not like they even wore me down before they ever they kept me in the game.

Don't explain it- they kept me in the game attacking me and lying about me.

Because now I well out out now, because when I was worried about now, I dream about stuff.

That was what you were worried about initially yeah, because I realize about four or five:

years ago. It's obsessive that I was already

obsessed you, you were telling me that it fucks with your head, the

certain amount of it after awhile it just fucks with your head yeah, the negativity yeah and I like have dreams.

I like dreams, are like twenty years long, like you do a where I'm

armor like it's it's like five hundred years ago, just like playing,



things eating food and, like put my kids to sleep in, like you know, cutting trees down in

walking around I. I have dreams, rabbits like normal and just being a normal person,

I never I didn't like

I think they have like all these shows. Homeland only shows are on this big demon. I didn't like calculate what I was going to do

and then I was already not ready to give up. I was ready to move on and innovate, and now it's almost like, it's God doing it.

Sounds like no. No, it's not that easy you're

the wall by your enemies to you're, going fight to the death, and then nobody got to say this, but I realize it's God's plan,

I'm not going to be turned loose. I was just going to do a couple tours in this fight and be be turned loose, and so so it's been

It's been fraying realize that this is all big stage and God wants to see some people. Dance

but I tell you the globalist think they're like running me out, but I think they've got me. It's the difference. It's like it's the opposite.



Now. They've turned me into this maniac. Well, there's a

definitely some sort of a struggle going on right now

is, it's seems to be like a universal struggle for figuring out what people are and how we should behave and who gets to decide that

and there's certain universal truths are ignored and there

certain ones that are emphasis overemphasized and there's certain ones that are. You know that

the Goldilocks spot, and we were working it out. I think that's part of what

going on with human beings. But we

have to be really really careful of. Is that by

silencing some people and never given

any path to retribution we create eternal enemies,

this is this is what easily could be happening right now with someone doesn't have ability to express themselves,

because an evil force once conflict and what you say. It's not only know if it's an evil force, but it's archival force.



They're listening to all those around them and there's a hive hive mind sort of thinking to allow

This there's not a lot of debate about

Let's just say this, Joe and and to ten plan. Everybody else you

you didn't give into the pressuring of the threat. It was more than

Maggie like a siren like a bitching woman, not against women.

But I mean not get it. That's why yeah? And so that's why?

Didn't have me on, but then you realize

was just a shamble,

If you just trying to live the life and put out good ideas and talk to people, but folks are going to

If you choose a side and that's what

happening in this quickening- and I don't want you to say that's why right

got a nailed nobody's coming to Ryan Seacrest for, like political advice, he's got mailed nailed

it's a bunch of shows real nice guys got a great smile. He figured it.

But you understand joke in that sweet spot man. I look at you going dumb,



we're talking about anything and everything. Oh my god! No just leaving himself is stagnant. Water,

Oh, it's still nothing's going

on it's all clear,

dead and rotting. What's a live ocean big crashing waves? Yes,

it sure,

she seen beyond. Everybody has but I've I've seen way beyond guys. You want to be in the

like you, want to be in a fight. You want to take all your

not successful Joe. Could you play

one of the system you're successful, because you did organically and real mean

perfect. That mean it's bad. It was real

why your success and then they come in you think, oh

you're, bad, I'm the same way. Oh all, these p

tell me how great I am a play. Ball with them, because I've got

this thing, but they

you because they're soulless

and so all I'm saying is you made the right decision and I just

have me on because I'm not perfect is deciding



no America still America, the world. Still the world wearily

to talk about real things in here, oh things, because they want to shut other voices down, so they can lie about those voices and any I'd. I

yeah that fears exposure. Our fears debate is a failed idea. Well, you know

I have a unique perspective. My perspective is less and less inclined to pursue it in the idea that it's a fight and more to be able to.

Pursue reason and to have

but communicate with each other 'cause? I think part of what the fuck is wrong with all of us today as it

people are so willing to take sides. So will you join teams and so willing to fight about shit that they really don't have to

about you, I want to say this, I'm a sack. This is so powerful. I don't dislike Donald Trump, and

I think, he's done some good things. I'm trying to piece and trying to get child back to America, but I hate Donald Trump

I got behind him is that Hillary was bad and then he became



my identity, he's not a bad guy, but the truth is I hate him or Hillary Clinton

he's, who I am now and whenever he does is who I am right now connected him, I'm with America and freedom and everything else, and I'm not throwing under the bus to get George Soros on my back, though they already after

the reasons I met with them, I'm not against even trump, but I get in a fight

like this that so dumb down,

then no matter what I do. They take my radicalness, my weirdness, to hurt Trump

but then all it does is like radioactively attack me. I don't know how to describe it, but it's like it's like Trump

breaking my legs every day and it's not

I'm not willing to go through the pain except along. He says I don't agree with and

not my identity shanty hooks, not mine. Oh, this is just trump talking from your own personal perspective, and I appreciate that that he's now,

I I don't know how many people actually think said he's your identity, but I think that what we're getting that that's



Morton is that we don't know when they're shooting at me they're going to Trump.

I'm sure, there's a lot. I don't mind the shooting at Joe. It's that I'm not Donald Trump. I understand that

you, but what I'm talking about is just the human race in general. If we could just do one thing be reasonable, just be,

seasonable and understand that emotions cloud judgment and that when people start screaming and yelling at each other and you

one side near the left and this guy takes another side and he's the right and you're going back and forth to default. It's nonsense and you don't ever get anything solved and you never get to understand how that other person thinks and feels, and we're constantly trying to mock people and what you were talking about.

About the bill. Maher thing about him, cracking a joke and I dismissed it is

Joe because it was a joke. Was talking about how the red states wish they were the blue states and all that shit? That's that's exactly the type of thing we're talking about, though, that that that that us versus them



that me verses, like you're generalizing, for entire swaths of the country's. If they're one yeah, I feel bad. Every time I say California is lost. This is a

beautiful steak. A lot of great people

is a lot of people here, a lot of them are fucking lost. That's a fact. You know

like who knows how many, like thirty, something million people died? Million, it's crazy. It's a giant country was the population of California, it's fucking giant. That's too many people to

there's no way. You could say Californians do this, this fucking, California, that are ranchers forty million. Can we fit the whole population of the world in Texas, though so, when you look at

we are overpopulated in some ways with our technology, but let me

make this point now. We end this. I gotta pee. So bad

go pee pee come back, will finish five more minutes. 'cause I want to talk to Eddie talk, some sense



her ego. Tell me about buzz. Aldrin. Tell me about your boy Buzz Aldrin. You know I'll tell you about those off. He told me

where you going back. Ok, it's careful round dot com.

Brown's dot com, Jamie Eddie, how you doing I'm doing good so um? What do you? What do you think about the wide receiver of the browns? I don't think we can turn to talk to brown right, no, no

fortunately, is okay. Is there any conspiracy theory, the use kind of are suspicious. There's got to be at least one yeah. There's that I definitely am. I like this one Ashleigh, nine, eleven, none of them

You think that you know what are you familiar with our seven yeah? I I would say from up almost every story, even out the stuff we talked about before in the past I'd, I don't believe the the official



end quote okay, so when so, you know that power seven was that the third tower that went down here where that right, yeah, I'm I'm, I look more when it when that comes up all of the surrounding information about what it, what wasn't in the buildings, not the not the actual event. I know the event happened,

I'm I'm not so curious about that. Did you see the video of tower seven

free fall, speed. That's got

a little suspicious

right, yeah yeah, I read flag gotta, come up at least right. It's if you're, trying to if you're, really trying to get to the truth. You're like wait a minute, I would say this for the fish. Is that a third building? Fellow

wasn't? It wasn't even hit exactly that's what

all stories with our seven and not only was it not touched by a plane. It went down at freefall, speed and it's caught on video like five different angles. Right

by different no one's saying that it's fake footage that's tower hours,

forty seven story, skyscraper fucking falling at free fall speed.



People are saying it got hit with a direct energy weapon.

Some people are saying that it was brought down like

troll demo in back in Vegas like one of those buildings, you know but Rick

hardness of how it was brought down. You gotta, look at that video footage

wait a minute and why is Youtube, taking down building seven footage yeah.

Here's one thing footage why letters on syndicated radio, like fifty stations in two thousand and one and I'm sitting there? That's actually was one hundred and twenty six is

tell us lost like seventy percent percent, it was an inside job. I don't mean the fireman blow it up. I'm watching Fox NEWS Cnn at my studio and then I go get a pizza, for

four CBS radio back ten

and they go Solomon Brothers Building, seven be

don't even controlled demolition to save other buildings, so I

back on here and

building was being brought down to say



other buildings and for like five

or goes I'm crazy,

CNN and all of them

archive it on the internet, everyone's watching, building, seven

BBC

B. Let me ask you: what do you think happened with Tower seven.

CNN Abc and CBS told me the government blow it up, the

Let me play the clips, they go come on

back, we're blowing it up and the media goes? Oh, you mean the cops blew it up. No, the cops are told, get back on the countdown

an intervention comes like generate. Seventy six, five hundred and forty three explained to me: do you think that they had detonations set up?

already in the building. That's where this goes. Next, Joe

which I used to always like try to follow down what it means. I don't know I've learned to go, hey I've got

five different news when it happened

and before is saying they blew it up. I don't know what happened. Is it possible that it collapse

because of those gigantic diesel fires right and then



forty one thousand two hundred and seventy six on building seven seven had a decent diesel diesel tanks in the basement and they caught fire. They said it was an inferno and they said it

he knows on hold on a second always, but I want to ask you this because I don't know yeah right, but it did. They said that what happened was this is whoever the explained it didn't. When I was gives you two videos

that the fire had burned through the internal structure of the building at such a high temperature that all

All of these floors lacks the pancaked, and then it came, but it never happened before sense. Right, never hasn't happened before a sense. That's here's!

think about Alex Jones eighteen years ago would argue every

point say: I knew what happened. Ok,

the Alex Jones. Two thousand and nineteen is honest. Well, I'm glad you're gonna say



I've seen him saying they blow it up and nobody can describe it. I don't know Joe what happened right. Well, when you look at it the way it falls, it falls exactly like controlled demolition. Exactly so it

from the top down, but if you actually freefall speed right, but if you watch the full video the center of it collapses like there's a full

the where you look at the top of the building in the center of it collapses far before the outside does that's how they take

take out the elevators central thing first, when they do light up when they do they do this with do they have it all set in advance, so they

I knew that nine hundred and eleven was going to come into the answer, my question, yet they don't know and what they do

They take like some clippings from twenty years ago right in

they going here,

CBS News and they don't show it. I mean I've got

CBS. I've got is a that, even though operation Northwoods happen in Gulf of Tonkin was a conspiracy. Is it possible that the

fires in that building were so



unbelievably hot that it fucked up every floor and they really did pancake on top of each other, and then the exterior structure just call

is that possible? Because not an engineer had the engineer say it's not it's not possible at all and here's the problem, Joe

they announced it fell on its own footprint, twenty seven minutes before it did

five channels to be

pc world

baby sheep.

CNN, CNN and CBS Joe key foot.

It was four o'clock. I've been on air since that morning, on

indicated radio. I drove down the local pizza place at four got. My pizza was eating it in the car,

and our CBS radio driving home and they said,

little Caesars been made to save other buildings too,

troll demolition, the Solomon Brothers Building building seven by late. We have these clips now.



But no one archive stuff that so I go in there and I go yeah. They just blow up a building. Everybody started

freaking out, but here's the thing

and they blew it up. How long does it take to set up explosives to the poor

we could pay? It normally takes away

That was the next story.

But then I interviewed

of emergency management for New York

the loose change people got him on and

no was there, they had bombs, they see you know. Unit was based in building seven right,

the CIA, the FBI all

the NSA as well everything he always says. Oh, I don't know he,

I might just kiss and Joes House like he's beyond ourselves with he slid. Oh, it's bullshit man, you know every fucking thing, just fucking say yourself now, once you explain it to everybody,



I'm gonna stay in. There, too, is like you better job, forty fucking stories of fucking government.

Right. So there's forty with a diesel tech

can pre rigged explosives. In case shit, dude didn't believe. I wasn't matter that, even though I heard CBS

say they blow it up, and even though,

go Jones as firefighters blow it up. 'cause the government same thing:

what you made a good point, I upset the

no. I don't mean my grandpa was in the army. If it really did pancake from the from the fire,

what a shit design, yeah

the terrible as I so mad. That argues for the debaters from underwriting laboratory me. Everyone went look at the blueprints and is New York.

I'm not defending what you're saying, because seven

well, it was looked at by lawsuits. They were soon

I wanted to though they were built with like bubble, gum and like Band

it's really not all those buildings already leaning? Oh no big, mob, scam

yeah, I know



They they already had buckling in the window. No mathematicians guess that within like five year

there's one building would collapse. Oh fuck,

So there goes your argument. It's New York. These buildings are built for shit.

And that's when you get older, you go some of our bill for shit right for sure right,

I don't yeah, I mean especially back then when was this idea tobacco I do have more tobacco, but I'm

so I have one little bit more tobacco. Yes for sure, one hundred

You know

Judy Wood. Is

Well, I do know she's she's got Doctor Judy Wood is wrote, a book called. Where did the

hours go part of her story. Her theory is this is just this.

Just some lady scientist, federal Supreme leader. There was this. What she claims

based on the video and the picture



that she has of

the towers collapse that you're speaking? For me, she saying

that there was no rubble. The book, the name of the book is called. Where did the towers go? She said that direct energy

weapon, some kind of direct energy weapons

justified the buildings, turn the buildings to dusk, because there was no rubble. A dude

a book on that crazy. This he's like in Australia, no, no in America using LA he told me they used Tesla technology. I was like what

images. Both say you're wrong. To ask that question. You know what for me it doesn't matter if it was justified or they better Habitat, LAS Vegas style it does it matters. Here's those buildings, in my opinion, is sandy hook

and in the world trade centers I've been accused of covering up. I don't like that. You be what he's been accused

covering things up of being a bullshitter like



I'm, covering up in Orlando Jones, says Donna lot of people think a lot of people think you're is dying, hologram planes, a lot of people think you're a zionist shill. You know that that's the biggest one, that's the biggest one about Alex G.

You know I'll be honest with you biggest the biggest one people always in you know what I always have. Your back always always. I said

you know what, if I didn't know him, I problem probably probably think that shows so I know you, you are honestly

making it a mission in your life to

search for the truth, to hear

about liberty you're for real. You want the best for people you're looking out for the people's best, what they were really so, whether you're right or wrong. It doesn't matter your. You know sometimes you're wrong, but we know he was in your old. So it's hard for me when I'm, like I'm saying, does have your back. It's

hard for me too



you're, like some sign a show like I know. Let's listen when people make up rumors about all kinds of people the day they come up with ideas that they wanna push. They decide to stay, as you know,

accuse someone of doing something really stupid like being a part of something

Here's the best way warmer, I use other back Alex when I take a lot of heat for it, but I got Michelle. They think I'm a zionist now, because she was friends with those people,

conspiracies. When you see conspiracies against you that you know aren't true. Doesn't that make you distrust conspiracies by you?

that's the part. That's the evolution of you between you now and you know. There's a lot of stuff is lies, but then

All that just say everything's is bs. You gotta check it. There's a lot of that going on right, exactly so

try to answer any questions, your question excellent as well, and the 2go together. I



I grew up in Dallas Texas, in the 80s and 90s, when it was like the murder capital of the country. I live in a middle class area, but it was still like, and you know

red necks. I I you know I got fight with with races, Mexicans the racist white people attacking Mexicans, but I I mean I had a big black eyes attacking me, like one three grades in school.

And my black friends would say man so cool you're. Not even though, even though

my cousin is eighteen or if you're like fourteen is attached, you and you know that was all just part of a development people two takes it. It does.

What what color their skin on is or where they came from, there's good black,

people there's bad black people. There's good white people is bad. Why people there's good Mexicans, there's bad mexican, just good Asians or Spanish,

there's good North Koreans, there's bad and Koreans,

stating really simple stuff for everybody knows but I'll go to a restaurant, if they've got good food, I don't care if it's ethiopian or it's mexican or germ.

Is the food's good? The people are nice. I love it like a women like I.



Black women white women. With hispanic woman, I love mall

Ok, the woman's cool I gotta bunch of black women there bitches black women, are cool. What about swedish bitches? The point is, let's just say, I'm super gay

The point is what I'm getting at here, though it's not like swedish school, but I don't know, let's wrap this up now. We need to wrap it up, but I'm going to make this point. I don't know what it is.

How is that? Getting into that? Oh, the racism thing it's not about,

and I would say something so similar, but he's like yeah, you told me: grass is green

models. Luther king, like it doesn't matter what color someone is it matters, what they stand for, what they do?

I go to restaurants that can be uh.

By Koreans or black people or white people whatever. If the food

is good music. I love Jimi Hendrix is black, but the food sucks that I hate it, but it's

because they're white, or because there is organic? Of course, I don't Joe, I don't use any loss and next to a Mexican for three hours, a hundred percent.



You totally love Mexicans. I do too mexican food

Joe we've had a big epic interview. It's been pretty God, damn good people at the end is this is not your record six hour, though no, but it's

damn good we're at like four hours or something something like that. Alright, you think this

I think you guys talked about aliens to fucking- really boost your search. Engine results on Youtube now will be, will be idle emanated from all search engine results, but I really

you'll be penalized for this show. You should say something about that, like

your life talk to me,

Joe Joe Jones on to say no one gotta sandy hook b. Well, I don't

I think anyone's going to say that, but people probably

say some things, but I think also, you know the idea that, like any

we should be able to tell you that you can't



talk anymore ever if you said one thing that people don't like or if you do talk it had

to be only on your side and you have to be trapped out of all of the different platforms for social media slippery.

Slippery slope, you know another training, people, but here's the thing. I do not a hateful person, I know you're, not a hateful person you may have

things that are angry in the past, about certain people or

angry about a certain event in the news, but you're not a hurtful angry person. If there's th,

things that you say that they can say hey. This violates some sort of a pattern of behavior urut

tracking someone you're giving out someone's address that kind of shit. They should be able to take it down

yeah. I agree, it's actual shows. That's not that's not speech is part of Peter I'm not doing that's. What I was going to get to. There should be a clear like set of rules, and you could

look these rules away, a lawyer would look at him and

Is this in violation? Is my client arrested will know your client



have anything illegal on him and we did a search. We found no drugs, we found no illegal weapons so, but we suspected that he was up

I'm getting is talking just in closing to say this. I don't want to make myself

center this at the end of the day, Infowars

from really successful in huge to like Zeitgeist insane,

and if you take any responsibility for any of that, do you have a human I'm a pervert right? Do you think that maybe you made it easy for some of the people that were going to tack and I've been guilty of this myself by providing fuel no yeah, saying stupid, I got a contact, yes, that's what I'm saying is accurate.

They say it. It's global is funded big corporation. This is what I'm saying closing its come out. We're going.

Release this show. The thing is: it's all left wing, that's where it's weird but yeah, it's a problem because you have

one ideology, that's

overwhelmingly in control of tech, and I

with the model lot of things under



social programs in a lot of it on welfare and universal basic income and civil rights and women's rights

agree with a lot of stuff. But it's an ideology.

Any idea, you don't want to hear you have to. I don't agree with it we're wrong, but does that free speech in it there's a lot of his life? You know. I just learned all this two weeks ago, what I got documents

I'll come back if you want, but you just like your right. I've been attacking the left for doing it and they're the instrumental group. That's caring

now he would think, would defend if you're right, wing, fascist who you get to go after freeze patient. Who do you get the left?

the trick of you trick him, and

right wing is tricking, the left wing and shutting down free speech off confirmed. Oh Jesus cry,

have confirmed, confirmed God, damn conundrum, let's Republican Party, not the average tea party people, the Republican Party,

What is blue blood? It thinks it runs the Democrats and it learned what was happening



come back for a whole show if you wanna my show about no seriously

I'll come and get you I'm gonna be another in March, I'm

Maybe at CAP City, comedy club in Aust promise you're coming home come on, come on,

set up for Joe I'm not just saying this. I swear to God, dude I'll, tell you bad stuff about me. I'll. Tell you better about me, I'm telling the truth here. I believe you at the back. It was amazing, but it's pretty good stuff

does could be a stand up. Comedian. You could do you could transition my problem and do standup stand up. Sure

you could crush Joe, I'm gonna keep trying aligning moody with you telling you the true, very good, I'm not trying to like bullshit. Like everybody else, I'm telling you man

The problem is it so real like every time I forgot was gonna, say what was I talking about? Do you be in it?



yeah the transition. What else did what else got plan? We with the other point, were just talking about social media and Youtube and people being able being

the silence, people and push their leftist ideology or any of the other right wing ideology. Republicans were manipulating the Democrats 'cause. I know your secret, you are empathetic real guy as well. I love you and you

kind of like couldn't handle anymore, which I actually want to be like that. So then you kind of doubt

cause aggressive. You look at it. I have looked at all this stuff

and I have seen what their own perspectives and their own plans are

and they go to Congress and they lie about all of it. They're, not liberal than conservative. It's big corporations

coming up with China.

As you said earlier, to unify the propaganda quote: Influence China. No, do they get all the technology? We

Our open society to totally take over

and so that's what I'm trying to get through to you is that is that they're coming after ever

body, like you said earlier, when



First, a daily, you walk in the office. I was here too much for you to go. I want to talk

the thing you said about you know the censorship.

Once they get us to submit were broken,

What you said was that it was a slippery slope that if you give in one percent you out one percent. I still have this other other ninety nine percent, and then you start moving the boundaries they start moving in closer and closer to one hundred percent makes sense people

exist in these these control

cool patterns, it's real

the card, and they keep asking me yeah like

when are you going to give up? Everything is okay as soon as you do like

you're gonna be okay. What does that mean? What is it? What is give up me and you stop talking so people enjoy watching? This was where it gets weird that people enjoy watching you talk and other people, don't why can't the people

don't just not watch you talk what is going on he's promoting truth. He is promoted truth, but I think what they've done is

they found these little pockets of



things read well that too,

but things now they've got organized ventures that, like I don't put to put down up, I make Jack Dorsey this villain.

Like we have pool is true. They had Millie

the of people harassing the stock and it

packing and lying on he's currently attacking children. He's trying to attack

children of their houses, and so it wasn't the

I got to see a guy's face and

what is a shareholder in a company owner? I'm the fittings

see our winner's name is yeah. Let's see,

the other guy. I don't know the the other guy Jack is a the twitter yeah yeah and as an Oliver Darcy yeah, and it's all in.

That is what I'm saying is I'm not even that guy's enemy, I just I understand, like he had millions of people attacking the shareholders,

yes did you hear about? There's a chef that makes pastries she's worked there ten years at Trump's hotel in Florida,

feed found out who she was and doctor and said, she's a cult



fire her like what does that even mean?

Why would anybody harass a pastry chef? That's a very good question. People feel like they're, a war. You know that's what

part of the problem with all the shit? That's why I was saying be reasonable. People feel like they're at war,

the right versus left, instead of just being a bunch of people talking about it. Trying to figure it out at least take on Hillary route shows are, are are Bill Clinton or George R, Donald Trump, which is why

can pastry chef yeah.

You think I'm both be at all type in Buzzfeed.

Here, Trump pastry chef. I don't think you will at all

Let me ask you this, because I've been talking way too much

in closing here at the end of this transmission. We should talk about a lot of things like those I have



when I was a maybe just tell you this is a fun podcasts. It was fun I go with. This is what I wanted people to say. Well, that has nothing to worry about. What I wanted people see is why I like going out Jones like why I enjoy hanging out with you. I wanted people to be able to see it because I have had to defend that because of

this narrative, that joke you could say I disagree with Alex and whatever you don't need to. Let the left this like make you bad. If I was Charlie,

mention. I should be able to come on your show. I want to call my show all right. We don't have to do this, Charlie Manson,

but I would interview that here's the thing I would interview. If the devil a big blue smoke,

would you want to stay a certain distance away from the devil, the devil's very sexually seductive

you know the delapp. What are you going to stand up? Well, you just please go to an open, we're seeing the devil, it's yes, I have hotter. Now



I've? I've divided just open MIKE night, a devil is pure sexual, so that you know the over. You know I'm not shameless Joe. How sexy is it AL? So I would, I would say sexy. I don't think I can get it up in front of a demon, no, not Damon. This is

those the big one, the big daddy. You know

you never know till he's kissing you, I guess,

could be the next SAM Kinison.

No, but it's something like you know the memory,

That concludes creature, will winning this agreement and yelling about the babies, Jesus Christ. He was out of the top yeah. Do it

then you know you can't we. I am a hoax about tennis one hour.

A little kid, and I was having these visions. I was asleep

I hadn't seen Conan the destroyer yet or come on. The barber was the first remember like

demons like laying on its side, looking guy, turns this big big fucking problem tax, yeah and when I was a kid that was was like thing like I would like like in these dreams. These go as university for like



I was like it's a gay dude like sitting there on his side like this,

a few years later I saw cone in to destroyer. I'm like that's the thing from the dream did, so what I'm saying is that a no sorry you seen like the Hobbit remake yeah yeah, where Gandalf

close to the castle in saurons, not made his body. Yet- and he looked looks like daddy, like that fire I've seen exactly,

so you want to talk about. What's that real controllers of the greys are it looks like

have you ever had a significant head injury

you have what happened to what happened to you. You know they're, going to NPR piece coming out next week to type all drives on the guy that never did that. What happened, what happened to your head, hot men, polygraph,

somebody pile drive you what happened? How old were you is about thirteen thirteen,



so many pile drive you and you had to change your personality. I got up and pushing really thrown that drinking out. I was dad while

so was it. It was like the state wrestling champion Middle and he is

cousin or something in the Dallas is like this is like you know, got me down.

I was never started. Five of these people here is that I'm not a victim of racial attacks, I'm not like Jeffrey or Jesse small it, as I thought rednecks and I got my leg broken

by so this guy pile drive you on your head when you're thirteen yeah

What did you do to your personality and then I had to fight his whole family

his family? It was a game. Changer did the champ, but did do you have any significant change from that head injury sometime?

People have energies, specially especially

seems like you know stuff. Just got better. Really



serious like this. We got to get to the root of swimming, that's good timing! No, I mean that's happened to a lot of my friend Dave.

He was just on here and he was

talking about how he got drunk and he fell down and cracked his head. It's crazy, but it cured his depression

got a little excited by this any

given time, somebody's, a regular guy and I would never start a fight. They kicked my ass, like the average one hundred and fifty guy you're, probably my ass, but when, like ah bunch of people are coming after me, it's like,

better, and I was a kid.

I was bash full time about the head into the concrete. With I got. I now hard now

dropped you on your head. What effect did it have on you? Physically? It was by the field house because it's

doesn't attack me and I beat him up, and so the state wrestling Champ was like a scene



it comes and goes oh yeah it's laying around and he got up on time

that was running like he'd won, and I punched him in the neck and brokers. It had a tracheotomy. Almost

as I getting killed me, is like he couldn't. He

training the ground. My heads bleeding all these stitches right here.

He couldn't believe when I got up and said what you died.

He couldn't understand like the energetic equivalents

he could understand being the nail, you don't understand being the hammer,

do you understand that and then they took

jail. They on some tough guy. My some I'm getting killed boys, I'm fight back, and so do I.

What happened your head? After that I mean I I never even got knocked out in that one. They

Why my I in the ground- and we were like everybody- made the joke- the concrete, concrete cracked was like only

the Congress he he pool



right in the concrete. I like split my head way up. This is true story. I remember just getting that was like slow motion around the neck and the and is the

Lise came that was that story. Did you go to the hospital? You know they took me to jail for that. But let me go. They didn't

check your head. Do you tell them? You got piled trying they showed it up. They sewed it up.

In the like.

See if you had a severe concussion or a subdural hematoma now ahead go been. It may

You think that he's a conspiracy theorist because it got dropped on his head. I think

there's something there's something to people that have had head trauma that become brilliant at speaking thing.

That's true, the and dump the black like his name is his name is Corey strange.

The only reason he won was. He was better or powerful. The main is he is like fucking. He had six packs.



Arnold Schwarzenegger Black did he

waited and gloated while blood was going on.

The last was he yeah and there's way more behind him. But you're you broke the concrete with your head, that's big! No! He did and the concrete didn't actually break that it. Maybe it did, but they made the

okay. So either a dinner got knocked out. He still got spiked on no to getting

spike head on the concrete. Let me choking myself with other bottle for fun. I've never been knocked out, okay, so

What kind of guy that draws told Reuters he had the incorrect hearing correct to see you you absolutely as he barely tapped his head. He would've been knocked out. Maybe not he doesn't matter. Thank you. So

sometimes people get knocked out through severe head injuries. Sometimes they don't sometimes their head.

Trip my dad hold on. Sometimes they never

lose consciousness. You can't think they always lose consciousness. Sometimes cracked out. I would



numbers like. I was a robot.

I will see you like messy she's ready.

You know, like you.

No that's true story. That's true story

and when, when you,

dang, there's something about getting dinged with a punch. You see that flash and you realize that you like your central nervous system, is like thirty percent, funk

so like whoa, verb,

very much with you. She just done it. That's what people say she stars yeah, that's what it was a very. Instead of Hollywood stars, 'cause they'd seen the stars like each stars like ahold,

I think I remember like somebody choking me like guys, like some

pulling a knife out, and you see that knife pulling out here like scoop sure at that point

USC everything for only those minutes when everything

clear,

survival motions.

But then you see like submarines, of the spacecraft



it's like when you dial into that. It's

total war. You say

any friends would choke you out. You have like these long dreams, oh yeah. No, that would be out for a couple of Santa Junior High six seventh grade chokes out a couple of times.

Stop

always be like guys like it's incredible. We do this during lunch and we go back

some of the press on their arteries. Like the bad times. We get your habit be like one time. I remember this one time they choke me out also is like a black knight with the sword goes through and like attacks me on this horse and then like

and then I was like in England thousands of years ago, and I had this wife, these kids. It was a whole lifetime like taking care

for them and like growing food and like a kid starve to death died, it was like

just those moments were, like whole lives, dead, kids. Everything is on sale



like you doll and all those ancestors, and it was like my kids and kids starving to death in, like people attacking us,

so. You think, all that information from your ancestors somehow or another encoded somewhere. That makes

if you think about what reincarnation must feel like you know, when people have that feeling that

this feeling that they lived before our whole body.

These are everybody before us right.

It's not it's not quite exactly so people they underestimate ago. I lived before

so they all live before. They would also explain certain fears that people just have as children like children have a fear of animals. Like you see an animal

big teeth, children have never attacked by K, but their ancestors got killed by yeah. They probably

got attacked by some bear somewhere and you know and somehow or another they got,

they survived that when it makes



how animals learn. Things mean. Animals just know things my daughter, but epidemics tape stuff or they can take

can generation chickens, enclosed beauty did a study on the second years

and fly hawk over. They all ran scared. They fly trying,

but here's the sack shape of log makes all the check ins run yeah because they did the it's it's it's programming exactly

exactly it's why? If you have a puppy and you take it for walks,

one is like six weeks old, it will never be around another dog again, it knows exactly what to do knows how to sniff things and piss on trees. Knows that check for other dogs piss and knows what to do. They know

to do. There's a they know what animals to chase. They see a squirrel. They want to go out early. So what I've lined up is with that way. You know

is. It looks like our species is super old. How old

I don't know 'cause, I can't even interpret the stuff I've seen

I mean I saw like you

Tom Cruise Movie were



stupid Tom cruise movie. How dare you, how dare

No, but Jack Reacher Jack, Reacher, two

oblivion.

They got? The giant landers selling up? Oh yeah you're sucking the ocean up as Adult Movie

outside and he doesn't even know he's working for the system, and so

don't tell you is

literally whatever it is, is like a joke like whatever created us, is like super bad ash, but is it possible that there's not a thing that

created us, but that we are just like every other organism and every other system on this planet. With this constantly evolve,

something that doesn't really have a leader and it's trying to get better constantly

Everything- and I agree- I agree with you but

this is this is where the stops?

sixty Joe you're right, but there wasn't a worm learned how to crawl up the ass of a grasshopper to program. Do that that there was some prime essence that was put into things that did that. That's



get free will and where the top of the food chain, or was it thousands and thousands of generations of failures Thous

the generations of bugs that got into

this grass averages was just killed it and then wind

suffocating to death inside of it, even though they were a parasite, they never figure out a way to get it. Finally, wanna figure it out, and finally, one of them, through some sort of weird mutation, figured out a way to interact with the brain of the grasshopper and actually guide it to the lake. Get it to

jump in the water and drowned it's burst from its body, then swim away,

publicist, but I think it's one of the most unlikely, but if you talking about things learning from things, if things learn from things and they keep getting better over thousands of thousands of generations, but these same things keep procreating. Wouldn't it event

we get to some state word figures out how to do something if it is still up

parasite and it gets inside the body. What if it figures out of

just like grow these things off the top my head and connected to the brain, this dumb little mother,



fucker I can get him to drown. You say the one thing you cheated right: yeah, they do make the connection and all

all the sales go up getting by birds, shit down more

animals eat it and that's the thing I think we're dealing with in unfathomable number of creatures that are being born and dying and new ones are being born and dying. I think

puny. Little brains can't really calculate the exact amount of cycles that it takes. Ok. Well, if you're single celled organism right to humans are free speech, then yes, that's this big openings, one hundred percent, so is it the whole modern leftist thing and all the left is eat, toast that we're going to let things be free, well, the

problem is the left. Aceto's is also the idea of inclusiveness and kindness and caring, like the idea is that they're promoting all the kindness. Now I get it better fall once a date, my five year olds, ok, but

I'm saying is

unless you're a right wing person. Now, if you think on the right, then they want to



thank you, then they want to want to demonize you and if they could shut you down in silence you and find some sort of a bullshit excuse to do so and a lot of

is. It seems like some folks lean in that direction, and this is where it get

dangerous, because you can't it's like

if someone says hey if I knew how to fight I'd run in front of pizza, I just fuck everybody up well you'd be dead in a year 'cause. Eventually, people are going to kick your ass and kill you. You can't just beat people up well, yeah, exactly if you can one hundred and one beat somebody, but it's everybody gets up against you. It's that child childish

mentality I'll just knock this person.

Nothing else will happen like that

know. You're setting the whole thing in motion when you silent some

you're setting a whole thing in motion, and this is

that we're all learning this is what we have to come to grips

with. Social media is only been around for

really short amount of time. It's a

been around in this kind of form for

plus years and we're figuring it out, and these people that

that they can just silence people and shut people down with



did having a bad effect on all of us. It's not right. It's right:

Well, I appreciate you should be a path point, blank spaces, good any. What do you think should be done about

denial of the reign of terror, of censorship.

Middle going on. I don't know,

you know. All I know is that it seems that the right is being censored a lot and when you look at the left and how they've been acting, I mean they're acting like psychopaths. Like pick, you know putting signs up for late term abortions and all that shit

they're pushing that. There's people pushing AOC says: don't gets there. It's

like someone who's trying to get fired. You know when you have a job and you want to get fired

talking to a doctor's helper for the floor.

Call CIA squads and he said what do you think Alex



they want to lose? What's the sign up, I don't know, that's. It seems like they're trying to it's so bad. It's

How much of that is influenced by people that are trying to fuck with the whole system

imagine if this is like stage five russian influence just get people to support later, like figure out a way to get people to support super late term abortions figure.

Way to get people to support trans women competing

as women with no yeah like I'm watching newscasts were like some twenty five year old.

There's like eighteen year old girls. He takes all the

The titles like now guys haven't you know it's hilarious, it's is it

it's hilarious. Imagine if your daughter was up for a scholarship and she had to compete against some six foot. Five man

identified as a woman who wanted to play basketball, I feel a if you've committed a crime if you're a felon, you can't chop your dick off.

I mean I like the japanese model. They said hey because I don't care if you're trans or your duty,



I don't literally of libertarian don't act like I'm trying to suppress pricey, but

Japanese said: hey, you don't get the trans destination less. You chop the Johnson and the way those off it's like hey you get, taxpayers will pay

or you get the vagina bill and you sit there and do it leave like

you know. I think, there's a lot of people that are legitimately trance. That's not the problem. The problem is they wanted to compete as women and Martina

average rollover just caught a rash of shit, but she was talking about it. You know

famous tennis star she's talking about that women are breaking all these record

and, right after she said that these kids number one

and two were trans gender that won the girls. High school track meet just

you know at a certain point. I guess you gotta stop doing this. We talking about competition body because they think there and uh.

Exactly, but at the same time, like I watch like bike race

is in running races in soccer and in high

company. It's a dude like he's not there.

These are bigger than me there like these six foot. Four!



huge soldiers of kick my ass, the

Well, that's that's been Luis Man, yeah, there's,

there's some nonsense going on. There's some people

legit and then there's some people that are just legitimately crazy. I, but like with everything in life, is people that

legitimately, trans and there's people that have you ever give a man wants to see himself as a woman, LA genetic shows the kimbles that happens, that's their issue whatever or vice versa, but like I'm gonna,

watch NFL and like we're supposed to, like you, know

women's NFL and it's

all guys- and they say their women is,

I think anyone last year where the guy comes in with tattoos, a big beard and was in the police report that guy had like a

foot, long cock and he goes do a cervix exam. What kind of police reported this the nurse said? Sure,

does she a vagina and

the report? The man had a foot long, Dick so



supposed to mentally ill. Go okay! Well, let me

You call this and decide that you've got all this. I mean it's just like it's mental illness man, it's not I

somebody that

Look there a woman or a man or whatever that's the lie.

Oh. You need to accept this or you hate ever imagine. If all this ridiculous propaganda really was like the very

the highest level russian,

Meme farm property,

and this is why people the could totally

is this most preposterously leftists, like even things like these babies being resuscitated and then killed like that people wouldn't freak out when they heard it. I talk about that kind of shit and management. This is all

but just designed to make everybody go fucking crazy,

yeah cause. You know, I wish you seems

the governor saying it, and-

I'm doing it and there's this one point we're going to transmission. What is the in game

is the end game out. Everything we're told is humanities. Bad Hooman is wrecking things, but the very invite

no scrubs



for doing? This are all like weird transhumanist antihuman, I'm all transhumanists. If I really get life extension, but

it's all. I owe you die your uploaded, a machine, I'm just saying anything. You see the big corporate media, promoting they don't know what they're doing I've been around them. I have to

talk to him, they don't know, I don't think I know I don't

Joe knows, I don't think Eddie knows, but I think in the spectrum of like

one hundred were in the 95th percentile of really being woke and we care about. Look. I don't like saying well

I'm not never get like three four years. Remember that black one was wrapped around the capital that military drill going and she

common random. They shot her oh yeah and those who,

likewise matter like four years ago, and I had like this outpouring of blacklisters and I'm not just things about money but like a million dollars came in like a week and it was all black people saying



I thought you were against black people, but when you sought cared about that woman being shot by the police at a checkpoint DC, we knew you were good

no one knew she was told a letter I did was

that thinking is in a black woman, is it uh

right woman is, it is

any woman I was taking their report. She went through

point got scared and

the police shot her

the police either on

yeah. There's cops, shooting

woman running away. It's like

would be a better way. You can't catch her bro. No! I agree.

That cop was bad. I think you got it that's what I'm saying is that era, but I'm not some goody. Two or she doing it's running away

just had a military drill for fat river? Was that a military drill? In most?

was the story Jamie. Can you find it? The woman gets shot a shot, but for the White House



someone people how many people get shot in this country every year, because someone just can't handle pressure right in front of the White House about forty trigger figure does know.

To do just makes the wrong decision shoot someone else. We don't blame God, because you use a car yeah, but but

It is true that

have a more suicides, but the rest of half is like people can handle it and uh that was like for five years ago. Here it is

their Capitol Hill, United

it's Miriam Carey, a dental hygienist from Stamford Connecticut attempted to drive through the White House Security Checkpoint in,

Black Infiniti G37 Coupe,

are you a secret service officer, but that's a lie: did they had the main roads and not trying to like anti cock black lives matter? It's not treated. They had all the road shut down

but she was trying to drive through a security checkpoint that could be still possible, that they had all the roads shut

and how many, how much she? What to one of was army right and she went to another and his army, and then they just shot her



and I'm not against the cops

daughter and she had her daughter in the car huh. That's a horrible story. I want to know that, but, but my point was, I don't judge things by money, black people, because that was really a big store at the time

when I came out because I seen the footage I was watching, live him taking

videos of black lady. I said it's a black lady and

what the hell this woman was like they

like oh, my god, he cares about black people, yeah man, I

about whatever the color they are

we propose that moment. They like all just bought product, and it was like this out-

boring letters and flowers thought you stood up for a black woman, I'm like dude, half of the black people incepted in this country are aborted, show.

Those planned parenthood groups out of real number yeah, like sixty percent some cities. They



hired. It was all set up. Margaret Sanger said we're targeting black people,

and you know what the other day I see big population as he dumb white people done black people. All these people I get like

too many people in some areas there are, I can get a little bit. The point is: is that

that you care about him when you're the KKK Democrats and you've got

british singer shut up

you're doing all this and I walk out of a mall. I won't have him all to years ago in Houston for the same black user, like group that was yelling at yelling it at the Covington Catholic Head, saying you're all nazis when they attacked them are the same one that cover their like black people. Black people are God

and white people are the and we're gonna kill the white people, and so I'm sitting there walking out of this mall right Trump got elected.

Houston. I remember 'cause. I was over my wife. She went like a burberry coat or something out visiting family



these black guys go we're going to kill you. I didn't hate him because they were black guys. They were literally nazis and I remember sitting there in that parking lot walking across, and I said well, if you're such big men

right now and it wasn't my wife. I challenge you see now when I get to kill you or just getting stuff saying

I cook a whore, we gonna kill your ass. I want to end this show on a positive note. I'm not against black people. Do I know you know no one saying that black people are like that.

One percent is not even 110Th

one percent. The point is, is that I've literally go to black history like



yes, I turned around. I wrote a story about a my website way way back in the day to tell her to hang out with them or not. George Washington was a black band. They had all this crazy interpretation of the Bible. One guy would read the other guy would like repeatedly towards Washington. They were saying exactly the dress up like superheroes. It's very unusual organization. Well, yeah this everybody was glad. I was a body double no! No! I know you were. I know you weren't there with the heat you know his take on. I mean I don't think it's a unified front. I don't think all black is relates across the.

We have the exact same ideas, I think,

we gotta end this. It's almost

I've o'clock still five hours. Yes, five! Don't don't hit anybody, let's be friends!
