So, Jordan, you've often talked about the importance of the individual over the collective, right? How does that philosophy play into our modern societal issues, like the push for group identity politics?

Well, Joe, it's fundamentally about the classic idea that the individual is the locus of value in our society. When we start categorizing people by group identity, we're playing a very dangerous game. It's like we're sacrificing the individualâ€™s capacity for transformation and growth on the altar of collective identity. This not only diminishes the person's responsibility for their own life but also inflates the significance of the group to a point where it's seen as the primary source of virtue or vice.

That makes sense. But what do you say to those who argue that group identities can provide a sense of belonging and support, especially for marginalized communities?

There's no denying the importance of belonging and support, Joe. However, when the group identity becomes the paramount aspect of one's being, it's a pathway to tribalism. We've seen throughout history and even in the present day how tribalism can escalate into conflict and suffering. The challenge is to balance the individual and the collective in a manner that respects the autonomy and growth of the individual while acknowledging the support systems that communities can provide.
